"tokenization_repair (``ntr``/``TokenizationRepairer``)","transformer_eo","Transformer model that repairs sequences by predicting repair tokens for each character.","X"
"tokenization_repair (``ntr``/``TokenizationRepairer``)","tokenization_repair+","Transformer model that repairs sequences by predicting repair tokens for each character. Different from transformer_eo because this model also was trained to detect spelling errors."," "
"tokenization_repair (``ntr``/``TokenizationRepairer``)","tokenization_repair++","Transformer model that repairs sequences by predicting repair tokens for each character. Different from transformer_eo because this model also was trained to detect and correct spelling errors."," "
"sed_sequence (``nsed``/``SpellingErrorDetector``)","transformer","Regular transformer processing a sequence of sub-word tokens. Predicts spelling errors on sequence level using the aggregated representations of all sub-word tokens.","X"
"sed_sequence (``nsed``/``SpellingErrorDetector``)","transformer+","Regular transformer processing a sequence of sub-word tokens. Before predicting spelling errors, sub-word representations within a word are aggregated and enriched with word features to obtain word representations. Predicts spelling errors on sequence level using the aggregation of those word representations."," "
"sed_sequence (``nsed``/``SpellingErrorDetector``)","gnn","Attentional Graph Neural Network which processes language graphs with fully connected word nodes and fully connected sub-word cliques. Predicts spelling errors on sequence level using the aggregated representations of all word nodes."," "
"sed_sequence (``nsed``/``SpellingErrorDetector``)","gnn+","Attentional Graph Neural Network which processes language graphs with fully connected word nodes, word features and fully connected sub-word cliques. Predicts spelling errors on sequence level using the aggregated representations of all word nodes."," "
"sed_words (``nsed``/``SpellingErrorDetector``)","transformer","Regular transformer processing a sequence of sub-word tokens. Predicts spelling errors on word level using the aggregated sub-word representations per word."," "
"sed_words (``nsed``/``SpellingErrorDetector``)","transformer+","Regular transformer processing a sequence of sub-word tokens. Before predicting spelling errors, sub-word representations within a word are aggregated and enriched with word features to obtain word representations. Predicts spelling errors on word level using those word representations."," "

"sed_words (``nsed``/``SpellingErrorDetector``)","tokenization_repair+","Transformer based model that detects errors in sequences by first correcting the tokenizationand then detecting spelling errors for each word in the repaired text."," "
"sed_words (``nsed``/``SpellingErrorDetector``)","tokenization_repair++","Transformer based model that detects errors in sequences by first correcting the tokenizationand then detecting spelling errors for each word in the repaired text. Different from tokenization_repair+ because this model was trained additionally to also correct spelling errors (it is also available in nsec)."," "
"sec (``nsec``/``SpellingErrorCorrector``)","transformer_words_nmt","Transformer model that corrects sequences by translating each word individually from misspelled to correct.","X"
"sec (``nsec``/``SpellingErrorCorrector``)","tokenization_repair++","Transformer based model that corrects sequences by first correcting the tokenization, then detecting spelling errors for each word in the repaired text and then translating every detected misspelled word to its corrected version."," "
"sec (``nsec``/``SpellingErrorCorrector``)","transformer_nmt","Transformer model that translates a sequence with spelling errors into a sequence without spelling errors."," "
"sec (``nsec``/``SpellingErrorCorrector``)","transformer_with_tokenization_repair_nmt","Transformer model that translates a sequence with spelling and tokenization errors into a sequence without spelling errors and tokenization errors. Different from transformer_nmt because this model tokenizes into characters and was trained on text with spelling and tokenization errors, whereas transformer_nmt tokenizes into sub-words and was trained only on text with spelling errors."," "
