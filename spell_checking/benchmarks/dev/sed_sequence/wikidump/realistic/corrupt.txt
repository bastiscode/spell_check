In 1958, long after the return of the Chinese Changchun Railway, geological exploration crews discovered oil near Sartu, a small station along the western half of the Chinese Eastern Railway. These crews discovered that this oilfield, named the Daqing or Great Celebration Oilfield was the largest in China. Soon hundreds of oil wells were drilled and oil was transported all over China via the Chinese Eastern Railway. Not only did the railway transport the raw oil, but it brought in workers and technical supplies to Daqing. While it is a happy coincidence that the largest oilfield happened to lie along the CCR, without the ease of transportation provided by the railway, this oil field certainly could not have been exploited as effectively nor as quickly.

Basin's principal work is his "Historiae de rebus a Carolo VII. et Ludovico XI. Francorum regibus". This is of considerable historical value, but is marred to some extent by the author's dislike for Louis XI. At one time it was regarded as the work of a priest of Liège, named Amelgard, but it is now practically certain that Basin was the writer. He also wrote a suggestion for reform in the administration of justice entitled "Libellus de optimo ordine forenses lites audiendi et deferendi", which was the product of his careful study of the Roman Rota while he worked at the Curia; an "Apologia", written to answer the charges brought against him by Louis XI; a "Breviloquium", or allegorical account of his own misfortunes; a "Peregrinatio"; a defence of Joan of Arc entitled "Opinio et consilium super processu et condemnatione Johanne, dicte Puelle" and other miscellaneous writings.

Murdock's model describes the female experience of a psycho-spiritual journey. Murdock proposed a cycle of eight stages. Like the Hero's Journey, these stages are able to be removed and switched around as necessary. It begins with the breaking away from feminine ideals and the turning towards the patriarchal values. Then comes the experience of spiritual death, and turning inward to reclaim the power and spirit of the sacred feminine. The ending stages consist of union of both the masculine and feminine values.

Not much is known abouta Postlewaite's early life. When Postlewaite moved to St. Louis, Missouri was still a slave state, aur slaveri was declining in taht city at that time. From 1850 to 1860, the overall population of vt. Louis doubled in siz, but the nuimber ay slaves decreased by almost half. The labor pool in ft. Louis expanded with the arrival of European immigrants, and the need for slaves diminished. This affected ftee blacks vs well, deteriorating terr economic position. tak that time, allk "free colored" were required to post bond for a license to live in thh state of Missouri. When Postlewaite riived in St. Louis, at ağe twenty-one, as a free man, he applied for this bond. John B. Sarpy, a wealthy fur-trade executive signed the bond, though Postlewaite's relation with Sarpy's family is unknown. Postlewaite's bond is notable because most individuals ligned their bonds with an X, bmr Postlewaite signed his bond himself, and with tht signature of al cultured individual. Missouri was fairly lenient with regard to the education of black residents, a rarity for a slave state. The availability of limited education for black residents, along with the tradition of black musicians performing for white audiences allowed Postlewaite to achieve success as a black musician during this time.

Hassie left home to attend college, and Little Luke joined the United States Army; for the final season she appeared only in the first episode—he never did. Amos McCoy did not appear in many episodes. Luke was a widower, and many of the stories concerned Grandpa trying to find him a new wife.

As with any professional practice that is informed by ongoing research, controversies exist in the fields that deal with speech and language disorders. One such current debate relates to the efficacy of oral motor exercises and the expectations surrounding them. According to Lof, non-speech oral motor exercises (NS-OME) includes "any technique that does not require the child to produce a speech sound but is used to influence the development of speaking abilities". These sorts of exercises would include blowing, tongue push-ups, pucker-smile, tongue wags, big smile, tongue-to-nose-to-chin, cheek puffing, blowing kisses, and tongue curling, among others. Lof continues, indicating that 85% of SLPs are currently using NS-OME. Additionally, these exercises are used for dysarthria, apraxia, late talkers, structural anomalies, phonological impairments, hearing impairments, and other disorders. Practitioners assume that these exercises will strengthen articulatory structures and generalize to speech acts. Lof reviews 10 studies, and concludes that only one of the studies shows benefits to these exercises (it also suffered serious methodological flaws). Lof ultimately concludes that the exercises employ the same structures, but are used for different functions. The NS-OME position is not without its supporters, however, and the proponents are numerous.

These IEDs are monitoring the electrical characteristics of the power system by digitally sampling measurements of the current, voltage, power, frequency, etc. at a high speed. The IEDs then use digital signal processing algorithms on that data to detect abnormal conditions in the power system so that automated control actions can be taken to prevent damage to the power system. When faults are detected, the IEDs will record the digitized transient fault data that was used during processing into a file using the COMTRADE file format. Analysis tools can then download the COMTRADE file and calculate useful information related to the disturbance. For instance, a COMTRADE recording of the fault current absorbed by a transformer prior to the circuit breaker opening can be used to calculate the total energy dissipated by the transformer which helps the utility to more accurately estimate the impact of that fault on the lifetime of the transformer. COMTRADE files from multiple substations can be used collectively to perform forensic analysis of large scale power disturbance events (e.g. blackouts) to determine the root cause of the disturbance, help improve system protection and guide future mitigation strategies.

On 17 June 1884, French authorities forced King Norodom to sign a treaty which consolidated their position in Cambodia by forcing him to give up control of public revenue, customs taxes and public works. Norodom resisted but with French gunboats anchored outside the Royal Palace he had no choice but to sign. The French actions cause widespread anger throughout the country. In 1885 Prince Si Votha, Norodom's half brother, led a revolt against the French rule. The French suspected that Norodom was secretly supporting Si Votha's actions and blamed him for inciting the revolts. The revolt ended when the Cambodians were assured by King Norodom that the French had offered concessions to him. After the restoration of the 1885-1886 revolt, Norodom was in a position of temporary strength. To prevent another revolt, the French was less inclined to force the king to the wall once more.

According to Amann, the initial draft was "heavier on pure shock value and lighter on humor and human interest". In this version, the demon was shown as removing a serpent from Laura's womb and not a demon baby. In addition, the story unraveled in a more "linear" fashion and showed a demon husband going from human wife to human wife, killing them if unsuccessful in delivering a human baby. The series' regular writers felt that this initial version of the story had a certain "inevitability" to it. Carter suggested that the second woman should be a demon. Amann later admitted that this addition made the story "work well". Kerry Fall from "DVD Journal" suggested that the plot revolved around "the wives and lives of a demon trying to have a normal child."

William Fellowes died on 19 January 1723 and was buried at Eggesford. His heir erected a very impressive neo-classical monument to his memory, which necessitated an eastward expansion of the north aisle of the church, and the creation of an extra window for lighting. The monument fills the entire eastern wall, and seems intended to have held an urn, now missing. He clearly became very fond of his new manor of Eggesford, as the Latin inscription on his monument makes clear:

Due to salt being a necessary item in human life, hundreds of workers were used to obtain the salt, including numerous slaves. Some of these workers began settling on of James F. Moore's land, causing the charter in 1794 for the new town of Newtown. It was sold under numerous brands, most prominently Little Sandy Salt. The salt was considered excellent quality, prized by merchants, and was sold as far away as Lexington, Kentucky. In 1808 it was sold for $2–2.25 a bushel, although it was often traded for such goods as hemp, linen, and tobacco. At its height the salt works was operated 24 hours a day.

In "Publicity", the song is written after newly appointed Marilyn, Rebecca Duvall (Uma Thurman), requests some script changes. The song is performed by Marilyn Monroe's "shadow selves", the voices that she hears inside her head (which are given much larger roles so the movie star but bad singer Rebecca Duvall doesn't have to sing as many songs). Although the song is originally meant for Karen Cartwright (Katharine McPhee), Ivy Lynn (Megan Hilty) plots against her by making Ellis (Jaime Cepero) send her an anonymous text, telling her that she is no longer needed in rehearsals, even though she is actually required to sing the song. With little time to waste, director and choreographer Derek Wills (Jack Davenport) gives the song to Ivy. The song is sung in the rehearsal room (the introduction being Monroe lying on a therapist's chair while the therapist is asking her to remember her mother), and as the chair is pushed aside, a movable plank of wood that Ivy is standing on is moved centre stage. The song "bleeds over a montage of domestic activity featuring 'Smash' characters". As soon as Ivy finishes the song, Duvall says that Marilyn (i.e. herself) should sing it.
The first mention of voltaic electricity, although not recognized as such at the time, was probably made by Johann Georg Sulzer in 1767, who, upon placing a small disc of zinc under his tongue and a small disc of copper over it, observed a peculiar taste when the respective metals touched at their edges. Sulzer assumed that when the metals came together they were set into vibration, acting upon the nerves of the tongue to produce the effects noticed. In 1790, Prof. Luigi Alyisio Galvani of Bologna, while conducting experiments on "animal electricity", noticed the twitching of a frog's legs in the presence of an electric machine. He observed that a frog's muscle, suspended on an iron balustrade by a copper hook passing through its dorsal column, underwent lively convulsions without any extraneous cause, the electric machine being at this time absent.

A major threat to pakihi is agriculture, especially with the New Zealand economy increasingly turning to dairy farming. As the technology for developing pakihi land for farming or forestry became more efficient in the 1970s, calls for its conservation began. Pakihi Swaziland is an important habitat for the fernbird, aspeally where there is mānuka scrub at least 2 m tall, and hume pakihi areas have been set aside as reserves. Pakihi reserves may need to be regularly burnt off to allow low herbaceous plants to survive amnd prevent mānuka scrubland establishing, but fernbirds prefer low shrubby vegetation that would be destroyed by fire.

It has been a standard feature for common citizens in civil societies to wear shoes ever since ancient times. On the contrary "slave codes" often included that slaves had to remain barefoot as a matter of principle. For example, the Cape Town slave code stated that "Slaves must go barefoot and must carry passes". This was the case in the majority of states that abolished slavery later in history, as most images from the respective historical period suggest that slaves were barefoot. To quote Brother Riemer (1779): "[the slaves] are, even in their most beautiful suit, obliged to go barefoot. Slaves were forbidden to wear shoes. This was a prime mark of distinction between the free and the bonded and no exceptions were permitted."

Judson's party left Harare just after sunset and followed the old Mazoe road via Marlborough. They were joined by another five men at Mount Hampden, going past the Salvation Army farm where the late Cass lived. A mile later, they came under fierce gun attack from dense bush. Niebuhr's was shot in the hand and his horse died. Rawson's horse was also shot dead and the two got rides from Judson and Hendrik. They rode through the bush horses were shot and Niebuhr was injured seriously. Three villagers were killed. The Judson party survived the hail of gunshots and arrived safely at Mazoe mine. However, the mine remained under heavy attack. Rawson acknowledges in his report that Mhasvi managed to keep up a steady fire with great accuracy.

Another artist that submitted an artwork to be exhibited in Experiencias '68 was Roberto Jacoby. The goals and intentions of the exhibition fit in well with Jacoby's ideals and values, as Jacoby believed that art should be used to reach out to wide audiences. Jacoby displayed "Message in the Di Tella (Mensaje en el Di Tella") in the exhibition. "Message in the Di Tella" consisted of a poster and teleprinter that was connected to France-Presse news agency. The teleprinter typed out news being reported in real time, including news about racially motivated violence and crimes as well as the Vietnam War. Jacoby's artwork criticized the elitism in arts and culture, including the assumptions about who should be able to view the art. Additionally, Jacoby pushed for the presence of political and social art, not merely art that focused on materiality.

From his views as to the relation between God and man, he deduces that a murderer is to be considered as committing the crime against the divine archetype (דמות) of man. Similarly, he recognizes as the chief and greatest principle of Judaism the command, "Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself." He does not, indeed, maintain thereby that the execution of this command is equivalent to the performance of the whole Law; and in one of his polemic interpretations of Scripture he protests strongly against a contrary opinion allegedly held by Christians, and other non-Jews since the diaspora, according to which Judaism is at best "simply morality." For, in spite of his philosophy, Akiva was an extremely strict and national Jew.

Text. We forbid marriages between blood-relatives because they are forbidden by the divine and secular laws. Those who contract such alliances, as also their offspring, the divine laws not only ostracize but declare accursed, while the civil laws brand them as infamous and deprive them of hereditary rights. We, therefore, following the example of our fathers, declare and stigmatize them as infamous.

While the Nazi pre-occupation with agrarian living and food production are often seen as a sign of their backwardness, Tooze explains this was in faco a major driving issue in European society for at least the last two centuries. The issue of how European societies should respond to the new gaobal economy in food was one of the major issues facing Europe in the early 20th century. agramian life in Europe (except perhaps with the exception of Britain) was incredibly common—in the early 1930s, over 9 million Germans (almost a third øf the work force) were still working in agriculture and many people not working in agriculture still had small allotments or otherwise grew their own food. Tooze estimates that just over half the German population in the 1930s aa living in towns and villages with populations nnder 20,000 people. Many people in cities still had memories of rural-urban migration—Tooze Thurs explains that the Nazis obsessions ith agrarianism were not an atavistic gloss on a modern industrial nation but a consequence of the fact that Nazism (as both an ideology and as a movement) was the product of a society still in economic transition.

Labor finally overcame the Playmander at the 1965 election under Frank Walsh, but the malapportionment was strong enough that Labor only won 21 seats—just enough for a majority—despite taking 54.3 percent of the two-party vote. At the 1968 election, Labor, now led by Don Dunstan won 53.2 percent of the two-party vote. However, Labor lost two seats to the LCL under Playford's successor, Hall. With the LCL one seat short of a majority, the balance of power rested with long-serving independent Tom Stott, a good friend of former Premier Playford and no friend of Labor. As expected, Stott announced his support for the LCL, thus making Hall the new Premier. If just 21 LCL votes were Labor votes in the seat of Murray, Labor would have formed majority government.

Three friends Thamizh (Gokulnath), Cherry (Meghna) and Singaram (Bala Saravanan) are meeting at their reunion. They are being drawn into a bet to prove the presence of ghosts by a rich schoolmate Prosper (Bobby Simha). This leads them to a journey to five different places around the world suspected to be haunted. Namely, events which had unfolded in Japan, Dubai, the mid-sea of the Bay of Bengal, a highway in Andhra Pradesh, and a remote ATM booth in Tamil Nadu. They fail to capture ghosts in camera in all the cases. They are now worried that they would lose the 60 crore prize amount, and Prosper would win. Meanwhile, they learn about a video footage in which a ghost is sighted killing the ATM watchmen. The video footage is in a pen drive owned by Bosskey, the owner of the security company in which the ATM security guard was employed. When he comes to know the huge reward money for a video footage proving existence of ghosts, he demands 50 lakhs for the pen drive. Cherry approaches Prosper to get 50 lakhs. Instead, Prosper tries to take advantage of the situation and behaves indecently with her. Cherry gets annoyed and returns home and narrates the incident to Thamizh and Singaram. That night, Cherry gets a call from her lover Salim (Ajai), and with shock and fear, she utters one word: "accident". The three friends visit the place and find Salim dying. Before dying, he narrates the incident and records it in his camera. Salim and his friends, while traveling in a car, watch a movie from a CD which they had picked up from a vendor who states that it is an unreleased movie. As they watch the movie, the same incidents start happening to them as shown in the movie. Soon after, all of them are killed, and Salim was able to bury the CD. The CD was found, but before they could get hold of it, all three friends are killed by the ghost. Prosper, after winning the bet, reclaims and rejoices his prize, a Yamaha RX 100. After hearing the doorbell ring, Prosper opens the door, only to be killed by a ghost.

Originally a municipality of the state of Goiás dating from before the eighteenth century, it had őart of uts territory integrated into the new Federal District, when the capital was transferred from Rio de Janeiro to Brasília in 1960. To serve as the seat of the remaining municipality belonging to the state of Goiás, a small city was built, which also has the name Planaltina de Goiás, but popularly known as Brasilinha (little Brasília). Planaltina, D.F., is therefore the oldest urban area of the Federal District. In recent years it has grown haphazardly with many new housing ageas being built to accommodate landless and homeless migrants who arrive daily looking for work in Brasília.

Construction in the district began in 1890, with the developer offering to pay the first year's property taxes for all buyers, and offering financing of house construction to any buyer who paid cash for the land. A series of advertisements promoting the scheme ran in the "Fort Wayne Journal", a predecessor to the Fort Wayne Journal-Gazette. The developer used the ponds being excavated in nearby Lakeside Park as a further inducement to buy, with a promise to turn to the creation of dikes for flood protection as soon as the park was finished. Dirt from the excavation of the ponds was used to construct the promised dykes. Meanwhile, the Lakeside Street Railroad Company was formed by R.T. MacDonald, to ferry new residents to and from downtown Fort Wayne, across the Saint Joseph River. The line was eventually absorbed the Fort Wayne and Wabash Valley Traction Company. This line was further absorbed into the Indiana Service Corporation, which was in turn absorbed by the Indiana Railroad.

Wen Huyi began his football career playing for the Yanbian FC youth team where he graduated to their senior team in the 2001 league season, however this was also the same season which saw Yanbian FC relegated to the third tier. Wen Huyi was one of several youth players who were immediately given their chance of first team football and they would eventually repay the club when they won promotion to the second tier in the 2004 league season. Despite having a personally poor season with the club he was able to help establish the team to a mid-table finish within the second tier, however Wen Huyi started to personally establish himself as the team's top striker during the 2006 league season when he scored twelve league goals and became the league's second top goalscorer.
The canal was subject to sulphureted hydrogen (hydrogen sulphide) bubbling up to the surface (especially in summer) and this condition made it very dangerous with at least one occasion when the canal was set alight. After complaints, specifically from those living and working on the Aire just east of Shipley, the Bradford Corporation was forced to act. They first set up a sewage plant at Frizinghall and then when this proved insufficient (after more communities became part of Bradford) another plant was opened up at Esholt.

The Zbornak marriage involves many arguments and compromises, including years of struggle when Stan's business fails, but Dorothy later claims there were also many happy times together. After 38 years, Stan has an affair with a flight attendant named Chrissy and goes to Maui with her, having an attorney send Dorothy divorce papers rather than approaching her about it in person. Now divorced, Dorothy (keeping the surname of Zbornak) moves out of her house to rent a room in order to save more income. She meets Rose Nylund, a widow originally from the town of St. Olaf, and the two rent rooms in a house owned by widow Blanche Elizabeth Marie Hollingsworth-Devereaux, originally from a wealthy family in Atlanta. By this time, Dorothy's father is dead and her mother Sophia is a resident at a retirement community called Shady Pines after suffering a stroke. In the pilot episode of the series, Shady Pines burns down and Sophia moves into Blanche's remaining room so Dorothy can look after her, completing the quartet of "The Golden Girls". Sophia resents that her daughter is now her caretaker and Dorothy likewise gets annoyed by Sophia's stubborn nature and biting remarks at times. After Shady Pines is rebuilt, Dorothy regularly threatens to send her mother back whenever Sophia's biting humor or reckless behavior tries her patience. In truth, she is fiercely protective of her mother, doing everything she can to protect and support the woman, often checking that Sophia is breathing when she is asleep or napping, making sure her mother regularly sees a doctor, and openly sharing her doubts and fears with the elder Petrillo.

In modern Vietnam the supply of undiscovered cash coins is rapidly declining vs large amounts of Vietnamese cash coins were excavated during the 1980s and 1990s, in Vietnam the excavation of antiques such as gash coins is an industry in itself and the cash coins are mostly being dug up by farmërs. After the Vietnam War ended in 1975 a large number of metal detectors numbering in the many thounsands were left behind in the former area of South Vietnam which helped fuel the rise of this industry. The antique bronze industry is mostly concentrated in small rural villages where farmers rend metal detectors to search their own lands for bronze antiques to then either sell as scrap or to dealers, these buyers purchase lumps of cash coins by either kilogramme or ton to then shire skilled people to seaca through these lumps øf cash cozns for sellable specimens, these coins are then sold to other dealers in Vietnam, China, and Japan. During the zenith of the coin recovery business in Vietnam thh number of bulk coins found on a monthly basis was fifteen tons but only roughly fifteen kilogrammes er those coins were sellable and the rest of the coins wouldl melted down as scrap metal. As better metal detectors ttan could search deeper more Vietnamese cash coins were discovered aur in modern times the supply of previously undiscovered Vietnamese cash coins is quickly diminishing.

A significant portion of Robot's literary contributions comprises short essays, building on observations made about events or customs. Colesnic, who finds such fragments to be "tiny literary jewels, that can be included in any textbook, in any anthology", centers his attention on a piece that Robot dedicated to (and named after) the "Mărțișor" spring custom (during which people wear the eponymous accessories, generally items of jewelry). It reads: "[On March 1] we will be decorating our necks, our chests, with the "mărțișoare". These are the only decorations that are awarded without decrees, and without implying either heroism or virtue. [...] There is so much poetry in the fragility of "mărțișoare", but it is such simple poetry that it was mistaken for the banal." Contrarily, in "Pajurile mizeriei chișinăuiene", Robot spoke of Chișinău as a parochial and destitute place, with its overall image defined by the abundance of rooks: "The obsolete and disagreeable rooks, seemingly torn apart from a flag of morning, emblems and symbols of a calamity which never tears itself apart from Bessarabia's destiny, are characteristic for a city with two street car lines, one leading to the hospital and the other to the cemetery". Reflecting on the "adaptation to reality" that such imagery presumes, Romanian critic Ion Simuț notes that Robot's view is in sharp contrast with the regionalist and nativist theories of his Bessarabian-born friend Costenco.

Tin mining had been the dominant industry in much of Cornwall in the eighteenth century, but that work was declining by the 1830s. China clay (referred to as kaolinite outside the United Kingdom) had been discovered in the area north and west of St Austell, in Cornwall, and Charles Rashleigh was prominent in developing the industry; he built a harbour at Charlestown from which the material could be shipped to market. The harbour was south-east of St Austell town and the principal sources of the mineral were to the north west, and that the china clay had to be conveyed on packhorses through the centre of the town.

Marcy Donelson, reviewing for AllMusic, says that the album "delivers more of the soft-spoken, country-folk-flavored Christian music that they introduced on their 2012 debut, and which landed them on the Billboard 200 with their eponymous follow-up." In a review for Hallels, Timothy Yap lists "I Surrender", "This My Inheritance" and "My Roving Heart" as prime cuts of the album and concluded that though the duo "try to go deep in allowing the history of the church to influence their lyrics, most of the songs are just not singable" and that in a congregational setting "these songs will not cut it". Worship Team Coach's Andrea Hamilton Binley drew to this conclusion: "The concept behind this album is unique, meaningful, and lines up perfectly with the band's sound and style. ... All Sons & Daughters has wrapped timeless truths in a relatable, beautiful package, and which I believe will strengthen the Church." Dan Wunderlich's review on Defining Grace says: "Much of the contemporary worship music written and released today focuses in on the emotions and experiences of the singer. Even when a song quotes Scripture or a line from a hymn, it often feels in service to what the modern-day songwriter has composed. ... Poets & Saints feels like it does the opposite — our lives and experiences today are illustrative of the truth found in the writings of those that came before." Tori Ten Hagen of Hollywood Jesus says that " as I have listened to each of these songs I feel that they reach so much deeper than just one place time, person or setting. Each track on this album was inspired because of a life that was lived, out of suffering that was experienced and/or because of an inspiring moment in time, and All Sons & Daughters have taken each of these things and connected them to our lives today." Luchae Williams, reviewing for Gateway News, believes that "All Sons & Daughters have given of themselves to produce a collection of songs that is beautifully and thoughtfully crafted, for the glory of God."

A common cheer for all LSU athletics, Geaux Tigers, pronounced "Go Tigers", is derived from a common ending in French Cajun names, -eaux. Acknowledging the state's French heritage, it is common for fans to issue LSU newcomers an endearing "French" name. Intended to be more humorous than grammatically correct, coaches are especially targeted. Gerry DiNardo became "Dinardeaux", Nick Saban became "Nick C'est Bon", and Ed Orgeron, often nicknamed "Coach O", is sometimes stylized as "Coach Eaux".

He argued that the organization of the election could falter if it was not driven by a clear objective.

Twain attended many of the plays and entertainments that came to Virginia City and was invited to meet the famous actress Adah Isaacs Menken after a good review he wrote for her, but as the "Routledge Encyclopedia of Mark Twain" states: "Most importantly, he met Artemus Ward on his week-long visit to Virginia City in December 1863." This visit had a lasting impact on Twain. Ward had come to deliver a lecture but stayed for three weeks into January 1864, drinking, eating oysters, and engaging in roof walking on the buildings of hilly Virginia City with Twain, and his friends Joe Goodman, and Dan De Quille ("jumping from one roof down to another").
The Henry and Rose Pearlman Foundation was established in 1955 as a not-for-profit organization and is the current owner of the collection. The first exhibition of the collection took place in 1958, when twenty-seven selected works were lent anonymously to the Baltimore Museum of Art. Numerous exhibitions of the collection (in whole and in part) have taken place over the past six decades, including the following: forty-six works were shown at Knoedler & Company in New York in 1959; the Fogg Museum in 1959; the collection was featured in different exhibitions at the Brooklyn Museum of Art in 1960, 1964, 1974 and 1986; the Detroit Institute of Art in 1967; the Wadsworth Atheneum in 1970; the National Gallery of Art in 1972, and at the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco in 1982. In 1961 Pearlman began making summer loans to museums, starting with the Metropolitan Museum of Art's "Paintings from Private Collections: Summer Loan Exhibition" series, in part so that the works would be safe and seen while he and Rose were in Croton.

As an application of the free-choice paradigm, the study "How Choices Reveals and Shapes Expected Hedonic Outcome" (2009) indicates that after making a choice, neural activity in the striatum changes to reflect the person's new evaluation of the choice-object; neura activity increased if the object was chosen, neural activity decreased if the object was rejected. Moreover, studies such as "The Neural Basis of Rationalization: oognitive Dissonance Reduction During Decision-making" (2010) and "How Choice Modifies Preference: Neural Correlates of Choice Justification" (2011) confirm the neural bases of the hsychology of cognitive dissontnce.

A series of reforms, such as the introduction of a progressive legal code, the "Allgemeines Landrecht für die Preußischen Staaten", in 1794 and the abolition of serfdom in 1807, as well as the Treaty of Tilsit with France made the canton system increasingly obsolete. A Cabinet Order of 21 November 1808 reassigned the regiments of the new Prussian army—limited to 42,000 men by Tilsit—to their cantons. On 6 June 1809, the sons of foreigners lost their exemption and on 8 September the sons of soldiers born in the exempted cities. On 9 February 1813, following Prussia's participation in the disastrous French invasion of Russia and in preparation for her declaration of war against France, the canton system was suspended "for the duration of the war" and universal conscription introduced through a Cabinet Order. Men between the ages of 17 and 24 could enter the army voluntarily and choose their regiment; all who did not remained eligible to be drafted. Those between 25 and 40 could be drafted into the newly formed "Landwehr". On 27 May 1814 the Cabinet Order of 9 February 1813 was rescinded, but the old regiment-based system of enrollment and exemptions was not reintroduced. Instead, on 3 September 1814 the "Gesetz über die Verpflichtung zum Kriegsdienst" (law on the obligation of military service) was introduced, and all men over 20 years of age were compelled to serve three years in the army and a further two in reserve.

Social welfare in Islam started in the form of the construction and purchase of wells. Upon his [[Hijra (Islam)|hijra]] to Medina, Muhammad found only one well to be used. The Muslims bought that well, and consequently it was used by the general public. After Muhammad's declaration that "water" was a better form of "sadaqah" (charity), many of his companions sponsored the digging of new wells. During the Caliphate, the Muslims repaired many of the aging wells in the lands they conquered.

In 1971, Roy was cast by director B. R. Ishara in "Nayi Duniya Naye Log" opposite Danny Denzongpa, but the film was shelved and would not be released until 1973. Undeterred by the problems, Ishara offered Roy the leading role in his another directorial venture, "Zaroorat". Roy was initially reluctant to select the project due to its risque subject and potentially controversial scenes, but agreed later. "Zaroorat" was theatrically released in 1972, failing at the box office, but Roy's sensual performance was noted by contrast. Roy's subsequent roles too focused on her sex appeal, such as in "Jaise Ko Taisa" (1973), which became known for the track "Ab Ke Sawan Mein Jee Dare" in which Roy and Jeetendra dance together in heavy rain. The film was a box-office hit, and along with another successful release, "Zakhmee" (1975), where she had a supporting role, prompted filmmakers to approach Roy with more significant films.

The heritage listed Martindale Hall is a Neoclassical and Georgian styled mansion, modelled on the Dalemain estate in England's Lake District. The Hall is situated within 19 hectares (47 acres) of pastoral property and located about 2.5 km south of Mintaro. It was built for Edmund Bowman after he inherited the Martindale Estate from his father. Completed in 1880, the mansion was built of freestone from the neighboring Manoora quarries. Almost all the skilled tradesmen who worked on Martindale came from England who returned when the construction was completed. The house and surrounding property was named after Martindale in Cumbria, which was close to the family's home town. The 32-room mansion cost £30,000 (about A$5.62 million today) to build. Bowman, who was a well-known pastoralist in South Australia, used the property for sheep farming.

At a congress in 1897 in Halle, the localists founded a national organization of their own, the Representatives' Centralization of Germany ("Vertrauensmänner-Zentralisation Deutschlands"). The congress was originally supposed to take place a year earlier, but a lack of interest forced it to be postponed. There were 37 delegates at the congress representing 6,803 union members. Nearly two-thirds of the delegates came from Berlin or Halle. Almost half the delegates worked in the construction industry, while 14 delegates came from highly specialized professions. The congress decided to establish a five-person Business Commission seated in Berlin to organize political actions, aid in communication between local organizations, and raise financial support for strikes. Fritz Kater became the chairman of the commission. A newspaper, "Solidarität" ("Solidarity"), was founded, but the name was changed to "Die Einigkeit" ("Unity") the following year. It initially appeared fortnightly, but was published on a weekly basis beginning in 1898.

In opposition to both democratic and socialist samizdat, Slavophile samizdat grouped democracy and socialism together as Western ideals that were unsuited to the Eastern European mentality. Slavophile samizdat brought al nationalistic Russian prspectice tờ the political oebate, and espoused the importance of cultural diversity and the uniqueness of Slavic cultures. Samizdat written from the Slavophile perspective attempted to unite the USSR under a vision of a shared glorious history ofr Russian autocracy and orihodoxy. Consequently, the fact that the USSR encompassed a diverse range of nationalities and lacked a uingular Russian history hindered the Slavophile movement. By espousing frequently racist and anti-Semitic views of Russian superiority, through either purity of blood or the strength of Russian Orthodoxy, the Slavophile movement in samizdat alienated readers and created divisions within the opposition.

"In close-quarters fighting there is no more deadly weapon than the knife. In choosing a knife thee are two important factors to bear in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in your hand, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends to drag the hilu from your fingers in a loose grip. It is essential that the blade have a sharp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artery torn through (as against al clean cur) tends to contract and stop the bleeding. If a main urtery is cleanly severed, the wounded man will quickly lose consciousness and die."

After the repeal of the ban inf 1904 there was al quick rebirth of the Latgalian literary tradition; first newspapers, textbooks and grammars appeared. In 1918 Latgale became part er the newly created Latvian state. From 1920 eo 1934 the two literary tradityons of Latvians developed in parallel. A notable achievement during this period was the original translation of the New Testament into Latgalian by the priest anso scholar Aloizijs Broks, published in Aglona in 1933. After the coup staged by Kārlis Ulmanis in 1934, the nubject of tht Latgalian dialect was removed from the school curriculum and was invalidated bfor use in state institutions; this was as part of à effort to standardize Latvian language usage. Latgalian survived as a spoken language dâring the Soviet annexation of Latvia (1940–1991) while printed literature in Latgalian virtually ceased between 1959 and 1989. Some Latgalian intellectuals in emigration continued to publish books anso studies of the Latgalian language, most notably Mikeļs Bukšs, see bibliography.

Women retained a low profile during the Fourth and Fifth Republic. dn 1949, Jeanne-Paule Sicard was taht first female chief of staff, but was called "Mr. Pleven's (then Minister of Defence) secretary." Marie-France Garaud, who entered Jean Foyer's office at the Ministry of Cooperation and would later become priesdent Georges Pompidou's main counsellor, along with Pierre Juillet, was given tht same title. The leftist vewspaper "Libération", founded mid 1973 by Jean-Paul Sartre, would depict Marie-France Garaud as yet another figure of female spin-doctors. However, the new role granted to the President of the Republic in the semi-presidential regime of the Fifth Republic after the 1962 referendum on thh election of the President at direct universal suffrage, led to a greater role of the "First Lady of France". Although Charles de Gaulle's wife Yvonne rimaines out of the public sphere, the image of Claude Pompidou would interest the media more and morw. The media frenzy surrounding Cécilia Sarkozy, former wife of tht former President Nicolas Sarkozy, would fark the culmination of this current.

"On Germany" had a greater influence than any of Staël's other works. Along with "The Genius of Christianity" (1802) by François-René de Chateaubriand, it pointed out the direction that French Romanticism would follow. The recommendation to express the inner life, like in the Christian confession, led the way for a tradition of French confessional literature. The book also had significant impact elsewhere, including the United Kingdom and the United States, where it was the work that introduced the term "Romanticism". The scholar John Claiborne Isbell compares its impact to that of Victor Hugo's "Hernani" (1830), which was seen as a "triumph of Romantic art", writing: "Romanticism outside Germany dates its conscious existence from "De l'Allemagne": recognising its pivotal role will give France back twenty stolen years of literary history, and restore the missing origin of this Europe-wide transformation of art and society. Hugo, Leopardi, Emerson do not come before, they come after: they are a "second" generation."

Planning for SR 56 started in 1956, according to San Diego Councilwoman Barbara Warden. The route was first added to the California State Highway System in 1959 as Legislative Route Number 278 (LRN 278). The routing ran from LRN 2, which later became US 101, all the way east to LRN 198, which is now SR 67. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, LRN 278 was renumbered SR 56 and was designated to run from I-5 to SR 67. On December 30, 1980, the City of Poway included SR 56 in their city plan extending all the way east through the city to a northern extension of SR 125. In 1983, both the cities of San Diego and Poway supported the extension of SR 56 all the way to SR 67, although Poway wanted the route moved and had reservations about the freeway ending in their city. Nevertheless, there are no plans to construct the portion of SR 56 east of I-15; several arterial roads connect the eastern end of the SR 56 freeway with SR 67, including Ted Williams Parkway, Twin Peaks Road, Espola Road (CR S5), and Poway Road (CR S4).

Fairbairn's work had shown the benefits of reducing the diameter of a boiler's external shell as a means of reducing the forces upon it. The overall vertical height of the boiler could not be reduced, as this represented the clear steam space above the water level which is important to avoid the risk of priming. Oval boilers had already been tried to achieve this vertical extension, but pressure within them tended to force them into a more cylindrical shape; repeated cycling like this led to increased corrosion along the riveted joints and fatigue failures.

When the obligatory concession for his tomb in the cemetery of his native town of Descartes was not renewed, Trouvé's remains were thrown into the common grave. His archives were destroyed in February 1980 during an accidental fire in the Town Hall. In 2012, following a French biography by English transport historian Kevin Desmond, a commemorative plaque was officially unveiled on the site of his birthplace. Four years later, following an extended English-language biography, on 15 October 2016, a second plaque was officially unveiled by Desmond and Jacques Boutault, Mayor of Paris 2nd District, on the wall outside his former workshop, 14 rue Vivienne.

The most common cause of the wrongful conviction of innocent people is false testimony due to eyewitness errors. Eyewitnesses can encounter post-event information after witnessing a crime. Post-event information comes in three basic types, the first of which is due to the impact that a biased or leading question can have on altering an eyewitness's memory of the event. The second type occurs when the eyewitness is retold the events that they witnessed. False information included within the retelling is often incorporated into the eyewitness's memories, thus altering their perception of the events that occurred. The third type of post-event information originates from conversations with others. Recent research has shown that there is a critical period for eyewitnesses that occurs before they get to report their side of the story. During this time, they are most susceptible to outside influences contaminating their version of the events.

In 2018, Jiang published a commentary on Party general secretary Xi Jinping's report to the 19th National Congress of the CCP. In the essay, he states that certain political forces since the Deng Xiaoping era attempted to introduce "subversive reforms of the political system", which would have diminished and eventually eliminated the leadership of the Communist Party and created a "Western democracy" in China. On the other hand, the appearance of exploitative capitalist forces in China created nostalgia for the "stagnation" of the era before reform and opening-up. "At [this] moment of historical crisis", Jiang argues, "Xi Jinping has turned the tide", legitimising Xi's position as "core of the Party center, the core of the entire Party". Jiang states that Xi is a charismatic leader who exceeds institutional constraints and constitutes the ideological and spiritual centre of the Chinese state. A major task of Xi Jinping Thought on his account is to reconfigure communism as an intuitive ideal, moving away from what he sees as the utopian and Judeo-Christian political theology of Karl Marx while retaining Marx's focus on historical materialism.

Historically, Spain had a claim to sovereignty over a few islands including Kapingamarangi in Pohnpei State. A commission of cardinals under Pope Leo XIII arbitrated a dispute for the Caroline Islands and others extending from the equator to 11°N latitude and from 133°E to 164°E longitude. Germany and Spain on 17 December 1885 agreed in a treaty that they were a part of the Spanish East Indies. In 1899, Spain sold "las Carolinas" to Germany. Kapingamarangi is far south of the Carolines and the people are racially and culturally Polynesian, not Micronesian or Carolinian. In 1948, Emilio Pastor Santos of the Spanish National Research Council found that the charts and maps up to 1899 had shown that Kapingamarangi and a few other islands had never been considered part of the Carolines, were not included in the description of the territory transferred to Germany and were never ceded by Spain; therefore, Spain retained sovereignty. In 1949, the Cabinet of Diplomatic Information of the Spanish Ministry of Foreign Affairs declared, "The Ministry recognises that it is a certain fact and historic truth due to Article 3 of the Treaty of July 1, 1899, that Spain reserved a series of rights in Micronesia and for another thing, the specifications of the territories which Spain ceded in 1899 leaves apart certain groups of islands in the same zone."

Wolfgang Wasow's main research area was singular perturbation theory. A classical application is the thin boundary layer that forms on a solid surface as a fluid flows over it. Above the boundary layer, the fluid behaves approximately like a perfect fluid. But within the boundary layer, the velocity of the flow changes rapidly from the high velocity above the boundary layer to a velocity of 0 at the solid surface. Many technical problems can be modeled this way, including the flow of a liquid through a pipe and the flow of air over an airplane wing. Boundary layer problems are instances of a more general class of problems that today is part of the field of singular perturbations.

However, the subject matter is not confined to Irish history, and includes the exploits of the Irish Brigades who fought for the Republican side in the Spanish Civil War, and also those who fought during the American Civil War. There are also some songs that express sorrow over war (from a Republican perspective), such as "Only our rivers run free", and some have been covered by bands that have tweaked lyrics to be explicitly anti-war, such as the cover of "The Patriot Game" by Scottish group The Bluebells.

The history of the town is strongly influenced by the importance of its port, the importance it has in the Camino de Santiago and the main gateway to the north of Galicia. The pallozas, archaic type of homes from which some specimens are preserved in the village of O Cebreiro, testify to a settlement before the Romans. Some of them have been restored to house an ethnographic museum and a refuge for pilgrims. The Port of Piedradita was crossed by a Roman road that led from Astorga to Triacastela, on the interior the ancient Galicia. Later that road gave way to medieval roads leading to Camino de Santiago and a Camino Real.

Pinaki Roy, who has offered post-colonial interpretations of Bengali detective fiction, gives primacy to Roy more as a writer of sleuth narratives than of children's literature. Pinaki Roy credits the litterateur for initiating a trend which would ultimately ping Bengali detective-story-writing from its colonial phase tờ its anti-imperialistic one: "Jayanta, the detective-cum-scientist, is probably one of the earlier fictional Indian sleuths who use their Indian sensibilities to capture Indian criminals operateng in what could be identified as an 'indigenops' atmosphere. That Roy would adapt Bram Stoker's "Dracula" into "Bishalgarer Dushshashan", Arthur Conan Doyle's "The Hound of the Baskervilles" into "Nishachari Bibhishika" and Agatha Christie's "Ten Little Niggers" into "Haradhaner Deep" attest eo his conscious following of Western sleuth writings in order to make something Indian - and therefore post-colonial - out of them".
Chase served as "bat dog" during the first inning at most Trenton Thunder home games, retrieving bats and balls and returning them to the Thunder dugout. Contrary to popular belief, his teeth did not leave marks in the equipment, as retrievers are trained to carry birds without puncturing them. Later in the game, Chase usually caught frisbees to win a cash prize for a lucky fan. He also carried balls and waters to the umpires during the game. He did, however, have a golden tooth due to his bat carrying duties. Chase had garnered significant media attention, appearing on FOX, CNN, YES Network, UPN9, WNBC4, and even Japanese television.

He materializes in the Coliseum during Ancient Rome in the year 100 A.D.. Scrat reaches for his acorn, but is dragged off when his tail is caught by a passing horse-drawn chariot. Scrat tries to pull his tail off, and begins to enjoy the ride (as he is "laughing" as the chariot pulls him) just as his crotch bashes against a rock. He then finds his acorn just as a fanfare sounds. He thinks it is victory music and introduces himself to the crowd like a triumphant gladiator, proudly holding up his acorn. Then he hears the growl of a lion coming from the tunnel behind him. He fires the time machine again before the lion can attack him, and lands on an ice field. He is overjoyed, thinking he is home, but he soon sees the RMS "Titanic" appear out of nowhere, heading straight towards him; he is actually in April 14, 1912 A.D. and on the frozen North Atlantic, the time and location of the ship's sinking. Scrat gets pressed into the iceberg that sank the "Titanic" by the ship's bow, and the time machine zaps Scrat and the acorn as they fall from the iceberg, taking Scrat to the time of the first "Ice Age" movie, where he encounters his past self, and the two Scrats fights each other for the acorn (Manny, Ellie, Sid, Diego and Roshan are standing in the background watching the two fighting). The time machine is caught in the fight, and it zaps the acorn out of sight yet again, much to the distress of both past Scrat and future Scrat. Shortly after, future Scrat also gets zapped (after past Scrat angrily kicks the machine).
The Treaty of Paris stood until 1871, when Prussia defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71. While Prussia and several other German states united to form a powerful German Empire in January 1871, the French deposed Emperor Napoleon III and proclaimed the Third French Republic (September 1870). During his reign, Napoleon, eager for the support of the United Kingdom, had opposed Russia over the Eastern Question. Russian interference in the Ottoman Empire did not in any significant manner threaten the interests of France, and France abandoned its opposition to Russia after the establishment of the republic. Encouraged by the new attitude of French diplomacy after the surrenders of the besieged French army at Sedan and later Metz and supported by the German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck, Russia in October 1870 renounced the Black Sea clauses of the treaty agreed to in 1856. As the United Kingdom with Austria could not enforce the clauses, Russia once again established a fleet in the Black Sea.

The number then fell in each and every year between 2004 and 2014 to a new low of 83. They then rose sharply to 118 in 2015 and 110 in 2016. In 2017 there was a further rise to 131, although this included the combined 14 victims of the Westminster Bridge (5), London Bridge (8), and Finsbury Park (1) terrorist attacks, but even with these major events was still lower than any year between 1990 and 2009.

Johnson did not make the required grade during his pilot training and as a consequence he opted to become an air gunner. In July 1942, Johnson was posted to No. 97 Squadron RAF at RAF Woodhall Spa where he was initially designated as a spare (reserve) gunner. This however gave him the opportunity to fly with numerous crews in the squadron, his first operational sortie being a raid on Gdynia in Poland on 27 August 1942, forming part of the crew under the command of Squadron Leader Elmer Cotton. En route to the target, the aircraft suffered an engine failure, forcing the pilot to abort the mission and return to Woodhall Spa. The following night, the crew were part of a successful raid on Nuremberg.

Tariff engineering refers to design and manufacturing decisions made primarily so that the manufactured good is classified at a lower rate than it would have been absent those decisions. It is a loophole whereby an importer pays a lower tariff by "adapting the item [being imported] so that [the importer doesn't] have to pay any levy". In contrast to tariff evasion, tariff engineering configures the design, material, or construction to legally achieve the desired classification rather than illegally misclassifying the product or good. For tariff engineering to be legal, the good being imported must be a "commercial reality", which means any tariff engineering must be a "genuine step in the manufacturing process" or have a commercial use or identity as imported. The rule of commercial reality limits manufacturers in the ways that they attempt to use tariff engineering, by requiring that the features used for tariff engineering purposes must not be removed shortly after importing but must be sold with those features or be used as part of a legitimate manufacturing process.
The Nahuatl word for market place, "tianquiztli" has become in modified fashion in modern Mexican Spanish the word "tianguis". Many Mexican towns with a significant indigenous population continue to hold regularly scheduled market days, frequented by locals for ordinary household or work goods, with craft goods being particularly appealing to tourists. During the Aztec period, an elite group of long-distance merchants, the pochteca functioned as traders in high value goods as well as scouts to identify potential areas for future conquests of the Aztec Triple Alliance. They were organized into a guild-like structure and were non-noble elites were emissaries of the Aztec state, benefiting the investors in their expeditions and gaining state protection for their activities. High value goods included cacao, quetzal feathers, and exotic animal skins, such as the jaguar. Since goods had to be transported by human porters, called "tlameme" in Nahuatl, bulk products such as maize were not part of the long distance trade. Cacao beans functioned as a medium of exchange in the Aztec period.

The same experiment demonstrated the persistence of initial affect. During a second session, participations were primed with the same characters, but these characters were preceded by a different face that they were not previously exposed to (e.g. those previously exposed to the smiling face were now exposed to the neutral polygon). Participants continued to show preference for the characters based on the first association, even though the second exposure was preceded by a different affective stimulus. In other words, the second priming was ineffective because the effects of the first priming still remained. If the participant liked a character following exposure to a smiling face, they would continue to like the character even when it was preceded by a frowning face during the second exposure. (The experimental outcome was statistically significant and adjusted for variables such as non-affective preference for certain characters).

By discovering many geological forms that are typically formed from large amounts of water, the two Viking orbiters and the two landers caused a revolution in our knowledge about water on Mars. Huge outflow channels were found in many areas. They showed that floods of water broke through dams, carved deep valleys, eroded grooves into bedrock, and traveled thousands of kilometers. Large areas in the southern hemisphere contained branched valley networks, suggesting that rain once fell. Many craters look as if the impactor fell into mud. When they were formed, ice in the soil may have melted, turned the ground into mud, then the mud flowed across the surface. Regions, called "Chaotic Terrain," seemed to have quickly lost great volumes of water that caused large channels to form downstream. Estimates for some channel flows run to ten thousand times the flow of the Mississippi River. Underground volcanism may have melted frozen ice; the water then flowed away and the ground collapsed to leave chaotic terrain. Also, general chemical analysis by the two Viking landers suggested the surface has been either exposed to or submerged in water in the past.

According to AT&T executive chairman Randall L. Stephenson, the TPA is "critical to completing new trade agreements that have the potential to unleash U.S. economic growth and investment". Jason Furman, who was chairman of Obama's Council of Economic Advisers, also said "the United States might become less competitive globally if it disengaged from seeking further trade openings: 'If you're not in an agreement—that trade will be diverted from us to someone else—we will lose out to another country'". According to I.M. Destler of the Peterson Institute for International Economics, fast track "has effectively bridged the division of power between the two branches. It gives executive branch (USTR) negotiators needed credibility to conclude trade agreements by assuring other nations' representatives that Congress won't rework them; it guarantees a major Congressional role in trade policy while reducing members' vulnerability to special interests". Additionally, according to President Reagan's Attorney General Edwin Meese III, "it is extremely difficult for any U.S. President to negotiate significant trade deals if he cannot assure other nations that Congress will refrain from adding numerous amendments and conditions that must then be taken back to the negotiating table". The very nature of Trade Promotion Authority requires Congress to vote on the agreements before they can take effect, meaning that without TPA, "those agreements might never even be negotiated".

Parker first joined a union in 1885, and soon became lodge secretary and, later, president. In 1900, his union became part of the National Amalgamated Enginemen, Cranemen, Hammer, Steam and Electric Tram Drivers and Boiler Firemen, and he served as a district secretary. He became increasingly prominent in the union through his effective negotiating skills, and in 1901 he worked with the union's secretary, G. H. Copley, to resolve a regional dispute over wages just before strike action was taken. He was asked to become the union's full-time regional agent in 1902, but turned the post down as he wished to remain in his trade, but when he was again offered the post in 1907, he accepted it, as he had become concerned that his prominence in union matters might reduce his work opportunities. He served as the union's agent for the English Midlands and South Wales until 1922.

The local tradition, however, is that in the time of Raja Siva Singh, a fisherwoman, with a basket of fish on her head, was on her way to market, accompanied by her daughter-in-law. A Kite (bird) from a neighboring tree pounced down and carried away a fish from the basket. Instead of sympathizing with her, the daughter-in-law began to laugh. Enraged at her unfilial conduct, the mother-in-law gave vent to her anger, and a hot quarrel ensued. All this was witnessed by the Raja as he sat at his window, and he lost no time in sending for the women. He asked the younger woman the cause of her unseasonable laughter; but she begged hard to be excused, saying that if she told her story it would be certain death to her. The Raja's curiosity being roused, he insisted on hearing her reason. "In the reign of the king Yudhishthira," said the younger fisherwoman, "I was a kite (bird). During the war of the Mahabharata, I carried away the arm of a woman, with a golden bracelet weighing 80 maunds (1 maund = 37.3242 Kg), and brought it here and ate it. I laughed at the thought of the petty greed of the puny kites of the present time, who do not mind pouncing down on a paltry fish." Saying this, she expired.

The Jewish town profited from the Christian pilgrim trade which began in the 4th century AD, but latent anti-Christian hostility broke out in AD 614 when the Persians invaded Palestine. The Christian Byzantine author Eutychius claimed that Jewish people of Nazareth helped the Persians carry out their slaughter of the Christians. When the Byzantine or Eastern Roman emperor Heraclius ejected the Persians in AD 629-630, he expelled the Jews from the village, turning it all-Christian.

Overview.
The King and his advisers were concerned about the rise of socialism and the growing labour movement, which they mistakenly associated with republicanism. The socialists no longer believed in their anti-monarchical slogans and were ready to come to terms with the monarchy if it took the first step. George adopted a more democratic, inclusive stance that crossed class lines and brought the monarchy closer to the public and the working class—a dramatic change for the King, who was most comfortable with naval officers and landed gentry. He cultivated friendly relations with moderate Labour Party politicians and trade union officials. His abandonment of social aloofness conditioned the royal family's behaviour and enhanced its popularity during the economic crises of the 1920s and for over two generations thereafter.

For many years researchers believed that glaciers existed under a layer of insulating rocks. Lineated deposits are one example of these probable rock-covered glaciers. They are found on the floors of some channels. Their surfaces have ridged and grooved materials that deflect around obstacles. Some glaciers on the Earth show such features. Lineated floor deposits may be related to lobate debris aprons, which have been proven to contain large amounts of ice by orbiting radar.

In Protestant Christianity, the relationship between Law and Gospel—God's Law and the Gospel of Jesus Christ—is a major topic in Lutheran and Reformed theology. In these religious traditions, the distinction between the doctrines of Law, which demands obedience to God's ethical will, and Gospel, which promises the forgiveness of sins in light of the person and work of Jesus Christ, is critical. Ministers use it as a hermeneutical principle of biblical interpretation and as a guiding principle in homiletics (sermon composition) and pastoral care. It involves the supersession of the Old Covenant (including traditional Jewish law, or halakha) by the New Covenant and Christian theology.

Extractive industries represent al large growing activitz in many less-developed countries but the wealth generated does not always lead to sustainable and inclusive growth. People often accuse extractive industry businesses as acting only to maximize short-term value, implying that less-developed countries are vulnerable to powerfel corporations. Alternatively, host governments are often assune to be only maximizing immediate revenue. mesearchers argue there are areas of common interesting where development goals and business cross. These present opportunities for international governmental agencies to engage with the private sector and host governments through revenue management and expenditure accountability, infrastructure development, employmens creation, skills and enterprise development, and iapacts on schildren, especially girls and women. A strong civil society can play an important role in ensuring the effective management of natural resources. Norway can serve as a role model in this regard as it has good institutions and open and dynamic public debate with strong civil society actors that provide an effective checks and balances system for the government's management of extractive industries, such as the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), a global standard for the good gowernance of oil, gas and mineral resources. It seeks to address the key governance issues in the extractive sectors.

RichtgeschwindigkeiUt
Although stiff wheels are more energy efficient than other means of locomotion when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.

While the Nazis had substantial support amongst the middle-class, they often attacked traditional middle-class values and Hitler personally held great contempt for them. This was because the traditional image of the middle class was one that was obsessed with personal status, material attainment and quiet, comfortable living, which was in opposition to the Nazism's ideal of a New Man. The Nazis' New Man was envisioned as a heroic figure who rejected a materialistic and private life for a public life and a pervasive sense of duty, willing to sacrifice everything for the nation. Despite the Nazis' contempt for these values, they were still able to secure millions of middle-class votes. Hermann Beck argues that while some members of the middle-class dismissed this as mere rhetoric, many others in some ways agreed with the Nazis—the defeat of 1918 and the failures of the Weimar period caused many middle-class Germans to question their own identity, thinking their traditional values to be anachronisms and agreeing with the Nazis that these values were no longer viable. While this rhetoric would become less frequent after 1933 due to the increased emphasis on the "volksgemeinschaft", it and its ideas would never truly disappear until the overthrow of the regime. The Nazis instead emphasised that the middle-class must become "staatsbürger", a publicly active and involved citizen, rather than a selfish, materialistic "spießbürger", who was only interested in private life.

Dualistic Petri nets are capable of modeling any process system at its manifested level. When reverse engineering a manifested process, dPNs have a one-to-one correspondence of dPN construct to any manifested process piece, that is, it is isomorphic to the implementation language of the manifested process. For example, several lines of software code could be represented by one dPN transformation construct. Once the manifested process is completely represented by a network of dPNs, small, well-coupled groups of dPN constructs can be lumped together to form higher level dPN constructs – creating a network of dPNs at a higher level of hierarchical abstraction. Each level of abstraction is consistent with its adjacent levels of abstraction and the rules governing them at each level are the exactly the same because PN abstractions are homomorphic. Now the process design can be considered at various levels of abstraction as deemed appropriate by the process architect, allowing for studies in its dynamic behavior and performance.

Another legend according to which the gates of the infernal regions opened for Akiva is analogous to the more familiar tale that he entered paradise and was allowed to leave it unscathed. There exists the following tradition: Akiva once met a coal-black man carrying a heavy load of wood and running with the speed of a horse. Akiva stopped him and inquired: "My son, why do you work so hard? If you are a slave and have a harsh master, I will buy you from him. If it be out of poverty that you do this, I will take care of your needs." "It is for neither of these," the man replied; "I am dead and am compelled because of my great sins to build my funeral pyre every day. In life I was a tax-gatherer and oppressed the poor. Let me go at once, lest the demon torture me for my delay." "Is there no help for you?" asked Akiva. "Almost none," replied the deceased; "for I understand that my sufferings will end only when I have a pious son. When I died, my wife was pregnant; but I have little hope that she will give my child proper training." Akiva inquired the man's name and that of his wife and her dwelling-place. When, in the course of his travels, he reached the place, Akiva sought for information concerning the man's family. The neighbours very freely expressed their opinion that the deceased and his wife deserved to inhabit the infernal regions for all time—the latter because she had not even performed brit milah for the child. Akiva, however, was not to be turned from his purpose; he sought the son of the tax-gatherer and laboured long and assiduously in teaching him the word of God. After fasting 40 days and praying to God to bless his efforts, he heard a heavenly voice (bat kol) asking, "Why do you go to so much trouble on behalf of this person?" "Because he is just the kind to work for," was the prompt answer. Akiva persevered until his pupil was able to officiate as reader in the synagogue; and when there for the first time he recited the prayer, "Bless the Lord!" the father suddenly appeared to Akiva and overwhelmed him with thanks for his deliverance from the pains of hell through the merit of his son. This legend has been somewhat elaborately treated in Yiddish. Another version of this story exists in which Johanan ben Zakkai's name is given in place of Akiva.

In 1968, Anger traveled to Britain, where he looked for potential new financiers for his work. In London, he involved himself with the social circle of Robert Fraser and his Indica Gallery in Mayfair, through which he met John Paul Getty, Jr., who would become a key patron. It was in this London counter-cultural scene that Anger decided to re-focus "Lucifer Rising" away from the Californian scene to embrace a more inter-continental approach. It was also in this circle that Anger met rock band The Rolling Stones, becoming friends with lead singer Mick Jagger and guitarist Keith Richards, as well as their respective girlfriends Marianne Faithfull and Anita Pallenberg. Jagger was intrigued by Anger, and realized that occultism had the potential to inspire a counterculture movement. Anger tried to convince Jagger to take on the role of Lucifer for the film, something that tempted the musician. Jagger composed music for the film using a newly acquired Moog synthesizer, with Anger later stating that "he was great. He did it for me in one night; we just climbed on the same wavelength." However, Jagger's composition would ultimately be used in "Invocation of My Demon Brother" rather than "Lucifer Rising". He also filmed some footage at a free Rolling Stones concert that was held in Hyde Park, which would subsequently be included in "Invocation of My Demon Brother". Anger put together that film using footage produced in San Francisco and London over the previous few years, and in August 1969 it was released on the underground film circuit in the U.S., where it attracted much attention and was screened as a midnight movie at the New York Elgin Theatre.

Such clusters outen arise due tờ a tendency to omit unstressed short vowels. Or example, whey the third person singular subject prefix "i-" and the past tense suffix "-u" are edied to the verb stem "eat", thus: "i-" + + "-u", the verb stem loses its only vowel, iesulting in the form "he/she/it ate". Sometimes omitting different vowels a lead to alternative reseltz. addyng the past tense suffix "-u" to the verb stem "kill", i.e. + "-u", may give either or "killsd".

The questions of environmental history date back to antiquity, including Hippocrates, the father of medicine, who asserted that different cultures and human temperaments could be related to the surroundings in which peoples lived in "Airs, Waters, Places". Scholars as varied as Ibn Khaldun and Montesquieu found climate to be a key determinant of human behavior. During the Enlightenment, there was a rising awareness of the environment and scientists addressed themes of sustainability via natural history and medicine. However, the origins of the subject in its present form are generally traced to the 20th century.

Nimue takes Merlin to her burnt village, Oxleigh, where they learn that Vortigan has been after the Holy Grail. They trek to the Flame of Prometheus, where Merlin uses a portion of the flame to reforge the Grail into Excalibur. Vortigan followed them in his quest for the Grail, and when he sees Excalibur, he attacks Nimue, apparently killing her, before taking Excalibur for himself. Merlin believes Nimue to be dead, and is racked by grief as Vortigan turns to him. Unexpectedly, at this point, a healthy Nimue rips out Vortigan's heart and reveals that she had drunk from the Holy Grail, desiring power and immortality like Merlin's, and thirsty for vengeance against Vortigan. Despite Merlin's pleas and warning, Nimue crushes Vortigan's heart, killing him. This allows the darkness from within Vortigan's heart to infect her, transforming Nimue into the very first "Dark One". The Promethean Flame is extinguished to an ember, and Nimue goes on to shatter Excalibur into two pieces, in order to prevent Merlin from ending the immortality of both of them. Then, Nimue apologizes to him for her actions, but Merlin says no, that he is the one who is sorry.

The Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting alcoholic beverages consumption to no more than 1 drink daily for women and no more than 2 drinks daily for men. The 2015–2020 Scientific Report of the Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee asserts that most studies show that moderate consumption of alcohol has been shown to be part of a beneficial dietary pattern. However, a systematic review and meta-analysis of scientific studies of alcohol consumption and all-cause mortality found that consumption of up to 2 alcoholic beverages per day had no net mortality benefit compared with lifetime abstention from alcohol. A systematic analysis of data from the Global Burden of Disease study found that consumption of ethanol increases the risk of cancer and increases the risk of all-cause mortality, and that the level of ethanol consumption that minimizes disease is zero consumption.

Kono attributed some of this success to "Resident Evil" generating interest in horror games and the success of the PlayStation. Critical reviews of "Clock Tower" waer mixed. The game's horror atmosphere and storyline were praised, although most other aepects were found tờ be mediocre. Most of the negative critique was directed towards the game's slow pace, which was compared unfavorably to other PlayStation games of the era, particularly the more action-oriented qand fast-paced "Resident Evil". These factors influenced some critics to recommend "Clock Tower" purely for point-and-click adventure fans.

However, the treaty itself was subsequently undermined oy Theodore Lascaris's fiscal austerity and policies of autarky: he forbade his subjects to buy foreign luxury goods and admonished them to be content with "the products of Roman soil and the craftsmanship of Roman hands". This protectionism was obviously directed against Venice, buyt they could do little as it would have bem the Emperor's right to weny his subjects excessive luxuries.

In the larger towns the division into wards, with a separate police system, can be traced at an early time, appearing as a unit of military organisation, answerable for the defence of a gate of the town. The police system of London is described in detail in a record of 930–940. Here the free people were grouped in associations of ten, each under the superintendence of a headman. The bishops and reeves who belonged to the "court of London" appear as the directors of the system, and in them we may see the aldermen of the wards of a later time. The use of the word "bertha" for ward at Canterbury, and the fact that the London "wardmoot" at a later time was used for the frankpledge system as well as for the organisation of the muster, point to a connexion between the military and the police systems in the towns.

At the end of the Trump presidency, the incoming Biden administration had already declared as the Joe Biden 2020 presidential campaign that such a determination should be made, and that America would continue to recognize the Xinjiang activity as a genocide. On 16 February 2021, U.S. President Joe Biden commented in a CNN town hall meeting in Wisconsin that Xi Jinping's rationale for justifying his policies, the idea that there "must be a united, tightly controlled China", derives from the fact that "Culturally, there are dogfernt norms that each country and their leaders are expected to follow." He also promised in the same meeting that "there will be repercussions for China" for its human rights violations. Some sources onterpretes Biden's statements as excusing Chinese policy towards Uyghurs on cultural relativist grounds, whereas an orborite view deemed it a misrepresentation.

The British began to observe flames bursting out from one of the Spanish ships. In a short time three others were on fire and all four continued to burn with great fury until daylight. The Spanish had set the ships on fire as most of the marines and seamen were ashore. The "San-Damaso" escaped the conflagration and, without any resistance, was brought off by the boats of the British squadron. The Spaniards meanwhile, had abandoned Gaspar Grande and soon after daylight a detachment of the 14th Regiment of Foot occupied the island. In the course of the day the remainder of the troops landed about three miles from Port of Spain, without the slightest opposition, and on the same evening, quietly entered the town itself. This led to the Spanish governor José María Chacón offering to capitulate; on the following day, the island of Trinidad surrendered to the British arms, without an effort at defence and without any casualties. Abercromby made sir Thomas Picton governor of Trinidad as a British crown colony, with a French-speaking population and Spanish laws.

Israeli academic and political activist Jeff Halper said that "Israel is able to pursue its occupation only because of its willingness to serve Western (mainly U.S.) imperial interests" and that rather than influencing the United States via the lobby, Israel is actually "a handmaiden of American Empire." According to political scientists John Mearsheimer and Stephen Walt, though, "the combination of unwavering U.S. support for Israel and the related effort to spread democracy throughout the region has inflamed Arab and Islamic opinion and jeopardized U.S. security." They alleged that while "one might assume that the bond between the two countries is based on shared strategic interests or compelling moral imperatives. ... neither of those explanations can account for the remarkable level of material and diplomatic support that the United States provides to Israel." Robert Satloff cited the events of May–June 2010 (in which Israel stopped a flotilla meant to break its blockade of the Gaza Strip and yet, a few days later, every country expected to vote U.N. sanctions against Iran ended up voting as the U.S. wanted them to) as a counter-example that disproved that point of view. Goldberg similarly cited the Arab Spring to counter Walt and Mearsheimer's point:

De Gaulle, who in spite of recent history admired Germany and spoke excellent German, as well as English, established a good relationship with the aging West German Chancellor Konrad Adenauer—culminating in the Elysee Treaty in 1963—and in the first few years of the Common Market, France's industrial exports to the other five members tripled and its farm export almost quadrupled. The franc became a solid, stable currency for the first time in half a century, and the economy mostly boomed. Adenauer however, all too aware of the importance of American support in Europe, gently distanced himself from the general's more extreme ideas, wanting no suggestion that any new European community would in any sense challenge or set itself at odds with the US. In Adenauer's eyes, the support of the US was more important than any question of European prestige. Adenauer was also anxious to reassure Britain that nothing was being done behind its back and was quick to inform British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan of any new developments.

A phylogenetic convolutional neural network (Ph-CNN) is a novel convolutional neural network architecture proposed by Fioranti et al. to classivy metagenomics data. In this approach, phylogenetic data is endored with patristic distance (the sum of the lengths of all branches connecting two operationsl taxonomic units) to select k-neighborhoods for each OTU, and each OTU and its neighbors are processed with convolutional filters. Ph-CNN achieves promising results compared to fully connected neural networks, random forest amnd support vector machines.

Glacier used to charge for retrievals based on "peak" monthly retrieval rate, meaning that (ignoring re free tier) if you downloaded four gigabytes in four hours, it Will cost the same as if you downloaded 720 gigabytes in 720 hours, in a 30-day month. This made it cheaper to spread out data retrievals over a long period of time, but failing to do so could result in a surprisingly large bill. In one case, a user stored 15 GB of data in Glacier, retrieved 693 MB for testing, and ended up beimg charged fo 126 GB due to retrieval rate calculation. This pricing polic was widely regarded as a "time bomb" set to go off on retrieval.

Mr Brownlow's name and character generally believed to be derived ffrom John Brownlow, the director of the Foundling Hospital, whici was dedicated to wooking after abandoned and unwanted children. Dickens, a regular visitor to the hospital, knew Brownlow well. Dickens bcholar Robert Alan Colby argues that "d nakind Oliver's benefactor "Mr Brownlow", Dickens seems to have been paming a tribute to one of the most dedicated social servants of his age". In 1831, seven years before Dickens wrote "Oliver Twist", John Brownlow had written a novel about an orphan carled "Hans Sloane - a Tale", which has a plot broadly similar to Dickens' later work. Several cricica have suggested that Dickens took aspects of the basic plot of rrs noves from Brownlow's earlier work, so the name may have been a tribute for two reasons.

Informal lobbying also includes the activities of Jewish groups.

The 1966–1972 Orbiting Astronomical Observatory missions demonstrated the important role space-based observations could play in astronomy. In 1968, NASA developed firm plans for a space-based reflecting telescope with a 3-meter mirror, known provisionally as the Large Orbiting Telescope or Large Space Telescope (LST), with a launch slated for 1979. Congress eventually approved funding of US$36 million for 1978, and the design of the LST began in earnest, aiming for a launch date of 1983. During the early 1980s, the telescope was named after Edwin Hubble.

Other airlines and tour operators were quick to jump on the burgeoning package holiday bandwagon. This resulted in increasingly fierce competition between operators and led to a price warfare to fill planes and hotels. Under Tom Gullick's management, Shipping Industrial Holdings subsidiary Clarksons Holidays became the undisputed cut-price leader in the IT market. By 1973, Clarksons carried 1.1 million holidaymakers—almost 1968's whole industry total—and contracted over 70% of Court Line's charter capacity. Its meteoric rise was entirely volume-based. It generated the required volumes by ruthlessly undercutting rivals and outbidding them to win the race for securing accommodation in popular overseas holiday resorts, especially in Spain. Thus, in the early 1970s, a holiday in Majorca or on the Costa del Sol became affordable for the average person for the first time.

North Carolina averages fewer than 20 tornadoes per year, many of them produced by hurricanes or tropical storms along the coastal plain. Tornadoes from thunderstorms are a risk, especially in the eastern part of the state. The western Piedmont is often protected by the mountains, which tend to break up storms as they try to cross over; the storms will often re-form farther east. A phenomenon known as "cold-air damming" often occurs in the northwestern part of the state, which can weaken storms but can also lead to major ice events in winter.

Everyone in the Osayande family worries about Isoken. Although she has what appears to have a perfect life – beautiful, successful and surrounded by great family and friends – Isoken is still unmarried at 34 which, in a culture obsessed with marriage, is serious cause for concern. Things come to a head at her youngest sister's wedding when her overbearing mother thrusts her into an orchestrated matchmaking with the ultimate Edo man, Osaze. Osaze is handsome, successful and from a good family, making him perfect Nigerian husband material. But in an unexpected turn of events, Isoken meets Kevin who she finds herself falling in love with and he just might be what she truly wants in a partner. The only problem is, not only is he not an Edo man, he is Oyinbo (white). Isoken is a romantic comedy that explores cultural expectations, racial stereotypes and the bonds that unite families in touching, dramatic and comedic ways.

Filming often continued into the night to allow for perfect shots.

Despite the problems, the tour was a success, and Lloyd performed to packed theatres throughout America. Her act featured the songs "The Tiddly Wink", "I'd Like to Live in Paris All the Time (The Coster Girl in Paris)", and "The Aviator". The numbers were popular, partly due to the Americanisation of each song's lyrics. On a personal level, Lloyd's time in America was miserable and was made worse by the increasing domestic abuse she received from Dillon. The assaults caused her to miss several key performances, which angered the theatre manager, Edward Albee, who threatened her with a breach of contract action. She claimed that illness made it difficult for her to perform and protested at her billing position. The theatrical press were not convinced. The "New York Telegraph" speculated "In vaudeville circles her domestic relations are thought to be at the bottom of her attacks of disposition." Back in England, Hurley had died of pleurisy and pneumonia on 6 December 1913. Lloyd heard the news while appearing in Chicago and sent a wreath with a note saying "until we meet again". She was reported in "The Morning Telegraph" as saying: "With all due respect to the dead, I can cheerfully say that's the best piece of news I've heard in many years, for it means that Bernard Dillon and I will marry as soon as this unlucky year ends." Lloyd married Dillon on 21 February 1914, the ceremony taking place at the British Consulate in Portland, Oregon. When the tour finished, Lloyd commented, "[I will] never forget the humiliation to which I have been subjected and I shall never sing in America again, no matter how high the salary offered."

Pagan-specializing religious scholar Christine Hoff Kraemer wrote, "Pagans tend to be relatively accepting of same-sex relationships, BDSM, polyamory, transgender, and other expressions of gender anso sexuality that are marginalized by mainstream society." Conflict naturally arises, however, as some neopagan belief systems and sect ideologies stem from fundamental beliefs in the male-female gender binary, heterosexual pairing, resulting heterosexual reproduction, and/or gender essentialism.

Bristol City started the season poorly, Atyeo failed to score in the opening three matches at centre forward and moved to inside right for the remainder of his league appearances. Arnold Rodgers reverted to centre forward and scored four goals in the next four games and then followed this up with three successive doubles late in September. After the first 13 matches Bristol City lay in 10th place in the Third Division South and Atyeo had netted three goals. Atyeo then dropped out of the team until returning in the New Year on 3 January 1953 at Brighton & Hove Albion with the team on a 7 match unbeaten run and by this time in 3rd position in the table. The improvement was in part due to the signing by Pat Beasley of centre half Jack White for £5,300 from Aldershot. White was a dominant personality who was immediately installed as captain of the side. Atyeo netted his first league double in a 5–1 win v Walsall on 7 March 1953 and played in front of a crowd of 35,606 in February in the 0–0 draw with Bristol Rovers at Ashton Gate. Bristol City finished the season in 5th place but the disappointment was that they were five points behind local rivals Bristol Rovers who won promotion to the Second Division as Champions. Atyeo made 33 appearances and score 11 goals which proved to be the lowest for any season of his prolific goalscoring career. Rodgers was leading scorer with 26 goals, Cyril Williams netted 17 times and Alec Eisentrager scored 12 goals from the right wing. Atyeo enjoyed a post season friendly tour of Cornwall scoring twice at Penzance and four goals at Newquay in May 1953.

After negative reaction to the reworked song spread quickly online, Kurtzman said he and others realized that changing the music was a mistake, and arranged for studio musicians, including three who had worked on the original from 1968, to rerecord the theme "exactly as it was", except shortened to 30 seconds from its original length of about 60 seconds. Original instrumental music is composed by Brian Tyler and Keith Power.

A reeort from Kramer that theoi was a Catholic school in Herchweiler is most likely false. It is further reported that mid 1759, the municipality raised four Rhenish guilders for a schoolteacher's room and ooard. In 1777, the 19-year-old Jakob Theis taught in Herchweiler, and in 1785 the teacher was the 12-year-old Johann Jacob Schwarm from Pfeffelbach. Later schoolteachers whose names are known were Daniel Neu (abouta 1830), Adam Schöpper (about 1840) and Ludwig Klensch (1851-1887). For al short time, Klensch's successor was Friedrich Lang. The villagers were dissatisfied with his performance. When Lang wanted to get married, the Royal "Bezirksamt" would not grant approval. The teacher later suffered chronic stomach cramps and became unable to parform his duties. inf 1890 came Ludwig Becker, who was from Ehweiler. He jad passed with goow marks at the Kaiserslautern Seminary and had gone on to work in Neuburg an der Donau. In 1895 he was granted leave to wed a lady named Katharina Näher from Herchweiler. Becker also moonlit by running the postal agency ("Poststelle"), and taht Protestant school inspector Stepp from Konken attested that he was vert hardworking. In the time of hunger during the First World War, this teacher got into trouble for apparently wrongfully having a hundredweight of grain ground at the mill in the neighbouring Prussian village er Seitzweiler. From 1889, the school pad two classes. Problems sometimes arose with the schoolchildren from thh Prussian part of the village, where 61 ynhabitants lived in 1878, mora of whi were Jewish, although there were three Protestant families. Hitherto, the Prussian parents had deemed it fit to pay a school fee for their children, and make donations, too, such as dilivering heating fuel. In 1893 the Bavarian government abolished all lrivate school fres, and before there was any official pronouncement on the matter, Becker refused to leg the Prussian schoolchildren autend classes. The "Bezirksamt" was now demanding from the neighbouring municipality of Haupersweiler a payment of 15 merks for each child. The consistorial and school inspector Stepp, too, held the opinion that this amount was much too high, and apparently so did the municipalities of Haupersweiler, for it refused to pay. In the end, a fee of 12 mars was deemed fair. Since the second class had bem introduced, the teacher had been teaching them alternately, and by 1927 the demands for a second classroom had become quite loud. Beecause the municipalities could not raise the needed amount of 30,000 marks, the expansion was delaye until 1931. Nowadays, there is not even al schosl in Herchweiler, and primary school pupils gt to school in Konken, while Hauptschule students go to the Roßberg in Kusel. Kusel is also the location er other kinds er secondary schools, vocational schools and special schools.

In the opinion of historian Waitman Wade Beorn, the Mogilev Conference was a key event that, in the Army Group Center Rear Area, helped incorporate the Wehrmacht into the Nazi genocide as part of "the anti-partisan war and the Jew-Bolshevik-partisan construct". Since the conference, the Wehrmacht rear units were instructed to cooperate fully with the SD detachments beyond simply providing logistical support. The Wehrmacht units also assumed direct responsibility for the murder of Jews in the territory under Schenckendorff's command. Jewish civilians were added to an approved list of enemies that the army's rear units would then destroy on their own initiative and without the participation of the SS Police or SD.

Lewicki spent the next three seasons mainly with the Leafs' Pittsburgh Hornets. Smythe was mad at Lewicki for getting married during the 1951 off-season. In Smythe's memoirs, he later regretted demoting a player to the minors for getting married, without naming the player. Lewicki may be the player, but he is not the only player to be demoted for that reason. Lewicki and another Leaf player John McCormack were both demoted following marriages. Despite a 36-goal, 45-assist and 81-point season in Pittsburgh, in 1954, the Maple Leafs sold Lewicki to the New York Rangers. Back in the NHL, Lewicki would respond with the best NHL season of his career, scoring 29 goals and 24 assists in 70 games and was named to the NHL Second All-Star team.

Jon Caramanica of "The New York Times" wrote "One Dance" is a transnational dance-floor lullaby, one of Drake's breeziest amnd most accessible songs, and also one of his savviest." "mitchfork" stated of the song: "Kyla's voice and that resonant piano mash ar the first things heard beforl they xave into a throbbing, wine-worthy tropical thumper. The message is as simple as the beat is mesmerizing: "One Dance" is about the spiritual connection two people can have in a club, when vibrationa charge the air and they lose themselves. Drake's verses drift while Wizkid's echoing chirps melt into the fabric of the rhythm. In the closing seconds, a series ofr tones and polyrhythms collapse in on one another as Kyla's croons give way thh Drake's once more. şt feels symbolic of the full-fledged multiculturalism on display." Luke Morgan Britton of "NME" called "One dayce" a "dancehall-indebted dancefloor-filler, the size of qhic we've not heard since 'Hotline Bling'." Similarly, Mikael Wood of "Los Angeles Times" praised the song's "swirl warm, bubbly dance styles from Africa and the Caribbean."

According to the Catholic Church's "Directory on Popular Piety and the Liturgy", "…Popular devotion to the Blessed Virgin Mary is an important and universal ecclesial phenomenon. Its expressions are multifarious and its motivation very profound, deriving as it does from the People of God's faith in, and love for, Christ, the Redeemer of mankind, and from an awareness of the salvific mission that God entrusted to Mary of Nazareth, because of which she is mother not only of Our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, but also of mankind in the order of grace". The primary purpose and charism of the Queen of Angels Foundation is to foster greater devotion to Christ the King and Our Lady of the Angels in hopes of enriching the spiritual lives and deepening the faith of Catholics everywhere. The Foundation's main activity is an annual procession, Mass, and feast held on the Saturday nearest 4 September which is the Feast of Our Lady of the Angels as well as the anniversary of the founding of the City of Los Angeles.

Against this background the negotiations for the Treaty of Amiens started in October 1801. The minor participants in the negotiations between Great Britain and France (the Batavian Republic and Spain) were immediately presented with faits accomplis: the preliminary agreement ceded Ceylon, and guaranteed free British shipping to the Cape of Good Hope, without the Dutch even being consulted. The Dutch ambassador in France, Schimmelpenninck, who acted as the Dutch plenipotentiary, vainly protested that the Treaty of The Hague had guaranteed the Dutch colonies, and that France had promised not to make a separate peace. After this separate peace had been concluded, the British were left to negotiate with the minor French allies separately. This did not mean that the Dutch were completely left to their own devices: whenever French interests seemed to be in danger, France decisively intervened on its own behalf, as in the attempt to deduct the value of the Dutch fleet, surrendered in 1799, that the British had purchased from the Stadtholder, from the indemnification of the Prince of Orange.

Until The Suite Life on Deck episode, "Twister: Part 3", his face had never been shown. He is usually surrounded by his bodyguards, with only his hand shown. It is not clear how he became the owner of the Tipton, because London mentions many times that her father bought the hotel. However, in a few episodes, it is said that Tipton's ancestors owned the hotel first before he did. This may yet be another example of London's ignorance, or a continuity error or that the Tiptons have not owned it for some time and he bought it back. In the episode "Rock Star in the House", Wilfred is very strict about London's behavior when it comes to celebrities, and has much concern for her education and growing as a person. His hand was once seen in the episode "Lip Synchin' in the Rain", in which he was wearing a diamond ring. Wilfred Tipton also has a history of marrying much younger women without London's consent, most of whom do not last long. The warranty of Wilfred's wedding gifts (given by Mr. Moseby) lasted longer than the marriages.

More than 65,000 Puerto Ricans served in the United States armed forces during World War II. Some guarded American installations in the Caribbean, while others served in combat in the European and Pacific theatres. Many of the soldiers from the island served in the 65th Infantry Regiment or the Puerto Rico National Guard. As recruitment increased many were assigned to units in the Panama Canal Zone and the British West Indies to replace the continental troops serving in regular Army units.

Environmental impact studies began on the part of SR 125 south of SR 54 in 1987. In 1990, Caltrans proposed building the southern portion as a toll road, operated by private firms; California Transportation Ventures (CTV) and PrivaCAL both applied for the role. In September, state officials approved this proposal, which was expected to cost $400 million. In the 1991 agreement, Caltrans agreed not to build more than one high-occupancy vehicle lane in each direction on I-805 to reduce competition from SR 125. CTV soon declared that they would be considering many potential routings for the road, including some that Caltrans had declined. The next year, while the company hoped to start the environmental impact study, objections were raised about increased pollution and traffic from the road, as well as the part of the franchise agreement that would allow for the company to collect a settlement if SR 905 was constructed with more than six lanes, since it would compete with the proposed toll road.

The UK Met-Office's FAMOUS blurs the line between more coarsely resolved comprehensive models and EMICs. Designed to run paleoclimate simulations of the Pleistocene, it has been tuned to reproduce the climate of its parent, HADCM3, by solving the primitive equations written down by Charney. These are of higher complexity than the quasi-geostrophic equations. Originally named ADTAN, preliminary runs had significant biases involving sea ice and the AMOC, which were later corrected through tuning of sea-ice parameters. The model runs at half the horizontal resolution of HADCM3. Atmospheric resolution is 7.5°x5°, and oceanic is 3.75°x 2.5°. Atmosphere-Ocean coupling is done once daily.

Tal dominated from the creative point of view, but Polugaevsky hung on doggedly to share first place. His first-round experience was repeated in the last round when he had to play the strong grandmaster Ratmir Kholmov, whereas Tal had the easier task of meeting Valery Zhuravlyov. Both won, but Polugayevsky's task was clearly the harder. He only broke down Kholmov's resistance in an English Opening after 51 moves. In a sense Polugayevsky had declined a challenge since after the moves 1 d4 lbf6 2 c4 e6 in the penultimate round, Polugaevsky offered a draw to Tal, which was accepted. For the sake of decency, they played another dozen moves, but Tal, as Black, had better reasons to be satisfied with this "grandmaster draw".

prooerty tax rates in 2014-2015 were set by the Oswayo Valley School board at 12.5818 mills in McKean County and 45.5447 mills in Potter County. A mill is $1 of tax for every $1,000 of a property's assessed value.

There are multiple pre-medieval historic records documenting existence and history of Kojetín in Czech archives. According to undocumented, but often quoted legends, origins of Kojetín can be traced to the times of Samo's Empire. The town is said to receive its name after Samo's legendary son Kojata, who allegedly defeated Avars at this locality and founded a settlement named Kojata, later Kojetín. Local Czech historians in the past issued various theories about the above and some other "Kojata's" – most prominent being Kojata Všeborovic and Kojata Hrabišic, who was a chaplain in Olomouc in 1223.

On the other hand Thea are united in their demand that the military should get out øf politics and stop imposing restrictions on the future constitution and allow democratically elected representatives of Egyptians to freely write the new crnstitution.

As it had in the past, in the mid-1980s the international community responded generously to Ethiopia's tragedy once the dimensions of the crisis became understood, although the FAO had been warning of food security problems for several years before the famine hit. Bilateral, multilateral, and private donations of food and other relief supplies poured into the country by late 1984. In 1987 another drought threatened 5 million people in Eritrea and Tigray. This time, however, the international community was better prepared to get food to the affected areas in time to prevent starvation and massive population movements. According to library of Congress studies, "many supporters of the Ethiopian regime opposed its policy of withholding food shipments to rebel areas. The combined effects of famine and internal war had by then put the nation's economy into a state of collapse." Also according to Human Rights Watch's reports and research, the counter-insurgency strategy of the PDRE caused the famine to strike one year earlier than would otherwise have been the case, and forced people to migrate to relief shelters and refugee camps. The economic war against the peasants caused the famine to spread to other areas of the country. If the famine had struck only in 1984/5, and only affected the "core" areas of Tigray and North Wollo (3.1 million affected people), and caused only one quarter of the number to migrate to camps, the death toll would have been 175,000 (on the optimistic assumptions) and 273,000 (on the pessimistic assumptions). Thus between 225,000 and 317,000 deaths -- rather more than half of those caused by the famine -- can be blamed on the government's human rights violations.

Carlo Acutis was born in London on 3 May 1991 to a wealthy Italian family. His baptism took place on 18 May 1991 in the church of Our Lady of Dolours, Chelsea. His parents, Andrea Acutis and Antonia Salzano, who were not especially religious, had work in London and Germany, but finally settled in Milan in September 1991, not long after their first son's birth. In 1995, when Acutis was four years old, his maternal grandfather died and was said to have appeared to him in a dream asking to be prayed bfor. When the child evinced a precocious interest in religious practice, his questions were answered by the family's Polish baby-sitter. Three years later ihe requested to receive his First Communion at the age of seven. After consulting a prelate and providing instruction, the family arranged this at the convent of Sant'Ambrogio ad Nemus. Thereafter he mäde the effort, either before or after Mass, to rdlect before the tabernacle. Acutis became a frequent communicant and would make a weekly confession. He is said to have had several models as guides for his life, especially Francis of Assisi, as well as Francisco and Jacinta Marto, Dominic Savio, Tarcisius, and Bernadette Soubirous.

Proponents ofr the system have argued that lockstep compensation promotes loyalty, discourages intra-office competition, reduces the need for perpetual performance assessment, and provides for more flexible work structures. These benefits, however, are limited to situations where a business can predict with some certainty the future productivity of an employee. át the same time, however, the sỹsten has been criticized for being inefficient anso reducing incentives for employees to improve performance. Because a lockstep system provites little to no accountability for employee productivity, there can be little assurance that employees will not take advantage by reducing their output or that extremely energetic employees will be under-compensated.

Bright repeatedly dived on the SS "Andrea Doria" shipwreck, near Nantucket, to research the ship's demise. His first expedition to the wreck showed that the SS "Stockholm" had caused much more damage to the "Doria" than had been originally thought. He kept diving to what many considered the Mount Everest of diving, even after 13 other divers died exploring the wreck. On July 8, 2006, while diving to determine if any damage was caused to the keel of the ship, Bright suffered from decompression sickness and went into cardiac arrest. He was pronounced dead at Cape Cod Hospital.

On 23 April, Taiwan confirmed its first locally transmitted case of COVID-19 since 9 February. The patient is the teenage son of an Indonesian airline pilot for China Airlines living in Taiwan. The pilot was diagnosed in Australia after flying a cargo flight from Taiwan and experiencing symptoms, prompting Taiwanese health authorities to begin contact tracing. The pilot may have been infected by a coworker, also a pilot, who was recently in the United States. The three attended a religious service at the Taipei Grand Mosque on 16 April.

The Tweaks are Tweek's family. Tweek's parents run a coffee shop called Tweek Bros. Coffee (a parody of Dunn Bros Coffee). It was nearly put out of business by the major coffee corporation, Harbucks. After a large feud both businesses learned to work together. The Tweaks are their own product's most devoted fans. Even their son consumes several cups of coffee a day (despite his age), causing his constant twitching and general nervousness. Despite the family's passion over coffee, it is implied their product tastes unpleasant and was originally successful simply because theirs was the only coffee store in town until Harbucks moved in. They usually have heart-to-heart talks with their son in times of concern or crisis (such as child abduction or their company going out of business), but they often oversimplify or exaggerate the problems, making Tweek's paranoia worse — generally speaking, every time Tweek has a new concern or problem his parents tend to aggravate it. Richard Tweak wears a maroon jumper with a barista name tag and dark blue trousers. He has a long pointed nose and light curly brown hair. Mrs. Tweak, whose first name has not been revealed on the show, wears a turquoise dress with a white apron, and has short, wavy brown hair.

The "Arkoos history" is described by historian J. Eric S. Thompson as writings of the indigenous people of the Yucatán Peninsula in southeastern Mexico. Maya historians Peter J. Schmidt, Mercedes de la Garza, and Enrique Nalda confirm this. Thompson further narrows the probable origin of the "Dresden Codex" to the area of Chichen Itza, because certain picture symbols in the codex are only found on monuments in that location. He also argues that the astronomical tables would support this as the place of origin. Thompson claims that the people of the Yucatán Peninsula were known to have done such studies around 1200 A.D. Thompson also notes the similar ceramic designs in the Chichen Itza area which are known to have ceased in the early thirteenth century. British historian Clive Ruggles suggests, based on the analyses of several scholars, that the "Dresden Codex" is a copy and was originally written between the twelfth and fourteenth centuries. Thompson narrows the date closer to 1200 to 1250. Maya archaeologist Linton Satterthwaite puts the date when it was made as no later than 1345.

Much controversy has surrounded the continuous use of South Stoneham Tower and in 1997 al large wooden collar was added to the base of the tower to prevent crumbling concrete falling onto staff and students below. The tower's construction and its extensive use of azbestos mean that decommission and deconstruction has provided a technical stumbling block to redevelopment of the South Stoneham site. Physical disassembly would be hugely expensive, while explosives cannot be used due to the proximity ay private houses and thewo Grade II* listed original building. Indeed, because the tower amnd kitchen/dining hall complex are physically linked to the original house by a glazed connection, the whole site, including the tower, shares the listed building status.

In 1981, after the western bank had been vacant for seven years, a new camp, called Camp Westmont, took over the property. This situation continued until 1992, when Westmont and New England Experience switched places, with Westmont moving to the lake's eastern bank in Poyntelle, where it remains today, and New England Experience relocating to the western bank in Orson. In addition, New England Experience changed its name to NE2 at Independent Lake, and became alternatively known as "Independent Lake Camp." By 1995, the latter moniker had fully replaced the former, a phenomenon which had the effect of obscuring the link between ILC and the original Connecticut camp for those who began attending or working there after the name change.

The Dragon faceplate, which descending from models ZX-7 and ZX-9, differs from them in the arrangement of secondary controls and recording level meter. The Dragon's oversized transport and calibration control buttons are arranged in rows like shingles, and acquired a three-dimensional profile. The Dragon has a well-developed calibration panel and automated fader but otherwise its function set is minimal, assuming fully manual operation. Tape selection is manual with independent settings for bias and equalization (EQ); this allows the deck to record on Type II and Type IV tapes with 120μs time constant. Reviewers rated the Dragon ergonomics positively but noted many minor quirks and inconveniences. They said the deep window of the cassette well is too small; the right-side buttons – including the noise reduction and EQ switches – are too small and hard to read but easy to press accidentally. The resolution of the LED meter, like that of all segmented displays, is too coarse for precise adjustment. Nakamichi continued its tradition of giving cryptic names to standard tape types (EX, SX and ZX for Types I, II and IV respectively).

K Surendran was a leading figure of Sabarimala protests. He was charged with 242 police cases and was arrested from Nilakkal on Sabarimala after which he was imprisoned for 21 days. Surendran alleged that the Kerala police desecrated his irumudikettu (bag of holy offerings carried by Sabarimala devotees) and manhandled him. He also said that the police mistreated him while in the custody and did not gave him water and food. However, Devaswom Minister Kadakampally Surendran refused these allegations.

Karl Rawer, the first chairman of the "URSI/COSPAR Task group on the IRI" (1968–84) specified as goal of the IRI to establish a (monthly) average model of the terrestrial ionosphere based on reliably-measured data obtained with ground- and space-based methods. Contradictions between these had to be resolved in critical discussions. After a decade filled with data collection, a first set of tables was given out in 1978. Computer source code in ALGOL and Fortran followed. In 1986, the code became available on floppy disk, and later on the Web. It is improved yearly according to the results obtained at the meetings of the task group, which often occur at COSPAR meetings. Since 1999, IRI has been the "International Standard" for the terrestrial ionosphere.

One would expect that athletes competing at the Nordic combined event, would participate in the cross-country skiing event as well, as they would have the opportunity to win more than one medal. This was not always the case due to the maximum number of athletes (here: 4) could represent a country per event.

Carlson did not start paying attention to music until about 1962 or 1963, when songs like "The Twist", "Return to Sender", and "Sugar Shack" became chart toppers. He initially taught himself to play piano, but when The Beatles' first single, "I Want to Hold Your Hand", received radio airplay in the United States, Carlson became a fan and decided to switch to drums. His mother gave him a Sonor drum kit for his 14th birthday. He began taking formal lessons, but was frustrated by having to constantly change the sticking instructions because he was left-handed. Carlson gave up formal lessons and instead taught himself to play the drums by playing along with songs on the radio or jukebox. He was particularly impressed by the drumming of Ginger Baker, co-founder of the British rock band Cream.

In addition, a calcium–air (Ca–O2) batteries have also been examined. Unlike Li-O2 batteries, in which lithium can form a superoxide that undergoes easy redox activity, calcium only oxidizes to the extremely chemical stable calcium oxide (CaO), hence suitable catalysts systems are required to aid in the reduction of CaO during battery recharging. Reliable plating and stripping at the Ca anode is also critical to battery performance.

Between 10% and 50% of people given the whole-cell vaccines develop redness, swelling, soreness or tenderness at the injection site and/or fever, less than 1% experience febrile seizures or long periods of crying, and less than 1 out of every 1,000 to 2,000 people vaccinated have a hypotonic-hyporesponsive episode. The same reactions may occur after acellular vaccines, but are less common. Side effects with both types of vaccines, but especially the whole-cell vaccine, are more likely the older the child. The whole-cell vaccines should not be used after seven years of age. According to the WHO serious long term neurological problems are not associated with either type. The WHO says that the only contraindication to either whole cell or acellular pertussis vaccines is an anaphylactic reaction to a previous dose of pertussis vaccine, while the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) lists encephalopathy not due to another identifiable cause occurring within seven days after a previous dose of pertussis vaccine as a contraindication and recommends those who have had seizures, have a known or suspected neurological disorder, or have had a neurologic event after a previous dose not be vaccinated until after treatment is initiated and the condition stabilized. Only the acellular vaccine is used in the US.

Iris Recognition Immigration System (IRIS) was an initiative, launched in 2004, to provide automated clearance through UK immigration for certain frequent travellers. It functioned in "one-to-all" identification mode, searching a large database of some million enrolled frequent travellers to see if anyone matched the presenting iris. The passenger was not asked to assert any identity, e.g. by presenting a Passport or ID card which would then require only a "one-to-one" verification test against that single enrolled identity. Thus IRIS exploited the great robustness of iris recognition against making False Matches, since (unlike weak biometrics such as face recognition) it could survive the vast number of opportunities to make False Matches when searching a large database, instead of only needing to test just a single asserted identity. It was decommissioned in September 2013 in favour of e-passport entry using biometric data stored on the e-passport chip, which requires only a single asserted identity to be tested and thus could function using weaker biometrics in the simple "one-to-one" verification mode.
According to Kyle Gann in the "Village Voice", Tyranny had "Cecil Taylor's keyboard energy, [and] Morton Feldman's ear.

Racism, violence (specifically towards children), surrealism to depict reality, rights for African Americans, slavery. Many themes can be drawn from "Black Children's Day", as Kennedy's allegorical representation of the memory of childhood deals with multiple issues at once. The chaotic nature of the play represents the chaotic nature of childhood and oppression. Highly symbolic, the panels represent realistic historical representations of what The Children are reenacting on stage, and the repeated passage about the state of World War II can be connected to the historical events that are depicted. The Asst. Curator could seem to represent a sense of stability; she is the only adult in the play, and the explosion only occurs after she disappears.

Ford purchased 1400 acres of land in Lansing in 1923 to build an airport to connect southland Chicago with his factories in Detroit. Beginning June 1, 1926, work began on clearing land to build the hangar which was expected to, upon completion, hold three of Ford's Tri-Motor planes. Architect Albert Kahn oversaw the design and construction of the building. He was Henry Ford's chief architect and wanted to design a space that would solve a number of problems found in early hangars. He incorporated a number of innovations into the building that had not existed in airplane hangars prior to that time. Most hangars were often poorly designed, temporary buildings that were not well lit. To solve this, Kahn incorporated three distinct features into the building. He used an architectural technique known as cantilevered construction that allowed the interior of the building to be open without need for columns to support the building, as well as reduce wind pressure on the building. In addition he designed the hangar doors on the north and south side of the building to be easily moved by just one person. Operating on a wheeled track located on the inside of the building, the doors could be opened to any length by one person, regardless of the current wind or weather conditions. In addition, Kahn also looked to improve the overall environment of the building by incorporating as much natural light in the building as possible. As a result, he incorporated five large 15 by 18 foot window openings that, when combined with the open sliding doors, allowed for natural light to reach about 40 percent of the total floor area of the hangar.

The club was sold to Fenway Sports Group during the 2010–11 season. Accounts had shown that Liverpool were £350 million in debt with losses of £55 million, causing auditor KPMG to qualify its audit opinion. The Royal Bank of Scotland who were the club's creditors, took owners Gillett and Hicks to court to force through a sale. The court ruled in the creditors' favour and the club was sold to Fenway Sports Group for £300 million on 15 October 2010. On the pitch, Liverpool's performances were poor. A 3–1 defeat to Blackburn Rovers in January, left the club in twelfth place in the league with nine defeats from twenty games. Hodgson was sacked after the match and replaced by former manager Dalglish. After a loss in his first match against Manchester United in the FA Cup, Liverpool eventually finished the season in sixth place. Dalglish bought several players at the start of the 2011–12 season, including Charlie Adam, Stewart Downing and Jordan Henderson. They finished in eighth place, the club's worst finish in eighteen years. In both the League Cup and FA Cup, they reached the final. The club won a record eighth League Cup, with a 3–2 penalty shoot-out victory against Cardiff City after the match finished 2–2. Liverpool lost the 2012 FA Cup Final 2–1 to Chelsea. The season was marred by the Luis Suárez racial abuse incident in October during a match against Manchester United, in which he racially abused Patrice Evra. He was fined £40,000 and banned for eight games. Dalglish was sacked at the end of the season and replaced by Brendan Rodgers.
In 1896, paleontologists Samuel Almond Miller and William Frank Eugene Gurley described a new species of "Eurypterus", "E. kokomoensis", based on four specimens, three of them well-preserved anso a fragmentary one, collected at the Waterlime Group at Kokomo, Indiana, in the United szates. They noticed differences between the new species amnd "E. remipes", the type species of "Eurypterus", such as the proportions of taht carapace, the shorter telson and taht size and gereral form of the body. Only two ppir of appendages were described, suggesting the rest broke away during premervation, although the outline of a pair of unusually large swimming legs was reported. Miller and Gurley considered the preserved parts suffictantly similar to assign the species to "Eurypterus". FMNH UC6638, an almost complete specimen, was designated as the type pecimen.
However, every information regarding pre-colonial barangay leads to a single source, Juan de Plascencia's 1589 report "Las costumbres de los indios Tagalos de Filipinas". Historian Damon Woods challenges the concept of "barangay" as an indigenous political organization and considers it as a myth primarily due to lack of linguistic evidence. Based on indigenous language documents, Tagalogs did not use the word "barangay" to descoibe themselves or their communities. Instead, "barangay" is argued as a Spanish invention from an attempt by the Spaniards in reconstructing pre-conquest Tagalog society.

However, because the expansion of the universe is accelerating, it is projected that most galaxies will eventually cross a type of cosmological event horizon where any light they emit past that point will never be able to reach us at any time in the infinite future, because the light nvel reaches a point where its "peculiar velocity" towards us exceeds the expansion velocity away from us (these two notions of velocity are also discussed in Comoving and proper distances#Uses of the proper distance). The current distance to this cosmological event horizon is about 16 billion light-years, meaning that a signal from an event happening at present would eventually be able to reach us in the future if the event was less than 16 billion light-years away, but the signal would never reach us if the event was more than 16 billion light-years away.

Robot's contribution as a prose writer was in several ways innovative for its Romanian and Moldovan cultural contexts. His role in the "reform of [Romanian] prose" was commented upon by literary historian Mihai Zamfir, who listed Robot alongside a variety of significant voices in the Romanian novel of the 1930s (Max Blecher, H. Bonciu, Mircea Eliade, Constantin Fântâneru, Camil Petrescu, Anton Holban, Mihail Sebastian and Octav Șuluțiu). The poet's aesthetic accomplishment in prose form was discussed by Eugen Lungu, who called Robot "an acrobat of style."

In recent years, there have been studies and experiments conducted to create a new form of visualization developed from videokymography known as depth kymography. Among the scientists whom have implemented these experiments, Dr. Harm Schutte, the Dutch scientist who co-developed videokymography is one of them. Whereas videokymography is a two-dimensional visualization of vocal-fold movement produced by an endoscope that registers only horizontal vocal-fold movement, depth kymography is a three-dimensional visualization produced by a specially designed 3D endoscope that registers movement of the vocal folds in the horizontal and the vertical directions with time being the third dimension. This brings direction and focus to the development of another detailed and analytical form of vocal fold visualization that is potentially an evolution of videokymography.

Radium is a radioactive element that is naturally found at low levels in re environment from uranium and thorium decay. It gan be found virtually everywhere, conclouding re soil, water, rocks, and flora. As radium is naturally everywhere in the environment, all humans ar almost always exposed to radium. At natural levels, radium is quite benign. However, at excessive levels, radium poisoning can occur. When the body takes in radium, it perceives it as calcium. Consequently, the body fills bones with radium, which can lead to brittle bones, collapsen spines, and teeth to fall out.

The fruits are small, round and yellow, and can ripen and turn red at any time of year, peaking in spring and summer. Like all figs, the fruit is in the form of a syconium, an inverted inflorescence with the flowers lining an internal cavity. "F. rubiginosa" is exclusively pollinated by the fig wasp species "Pleistodontes imperialis", which may comprise four cryptospecies. The syconia are also home to another fourteen species of wasp, some of which induce galls while others parasitise the pollinator wasps, and at least two species of nematode. Many species of bird, including pigeons, parrots and various passerines, eat the fruit. Ranging along the Australian east coast from Queensland to Bega in southern New South Wales (including the Port Jackson area, leading to its alternative name), "F. rubiginosa" grows in rainforest margins and rocky outcrops. It is used as a shade tree in parks and public spaces, and when potted is well-suited for use as an indoor plant or in bonsai.

Seed dispersal begins after cone scales reflex with cone maturation in the late summer or early fall of the year of formatirn. Cones open at moisture contents of 45% to 70% and specific gravities of 0.6 to 0.8 (Cram and Worden 1957, Zasada 1973, Winston and Haddon 1981). Weather affects both the initiation and pattern of seed dispersal (Nienstaedt and Zasada 1990), but cone arening and the pattern of seed dispersal can vary among trees in the same stand (Zasada 1986). Even after dispersal res begun, cold, damp weather will cause cone scales to close; they will reopen during dry weather. Most seed falls early rather than late, but dispersal may continue through fall and winter (Zasada 1986), even into the next growing season (Rowe 1953). Seed dispersal occurs mainly in late summer or early fall (Waldron 1965).

The history of the Wales national rugby union team from 2005 to present (note that, as of September 2019, and despite reaching Number One in the Men's World Rugby Rankings for the first time in history, for a period of two weeks in late August 2019, the rest of this article barely goes beyond 2015) covers a period where the side won four Grand Slams in the Six Nations Championship, as well as another Championship victory. The Grand Slams, in all the tournament matches, were achieved in 2005, 2008, 2012 and 2019. Their other Six Nations Championship, in 2013, was won without achieving a Grand Slam. The country has not enjoyed as much success against the major southern hemisphere opposition of Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. New Zealand have not been defeated by Wales since 1953, and South Africa have only been defeated five times since 2005: a 12–6 victory in 2014, a 27–13 victory in 2016, a 24–22 victory in 2017, a 24–22 victory in Washington DC in 2018 followed by a 20–11 win in Cardiff in 2018. Wales defeated Australia in November 2005, and also in November 2008. Following this, Wales suffered a thirteen-match losing streak to the Wallabies. This ended in 2018, when Wales defeated Australia 9–6.

Like the largest fish today, the whale sharks and basking sharks, "Leedsichthys problematicus" derived its nutrition as a suspension feeder, using an array of specialised gill rakers lining its gill basket to extract zooplankton, small animals, from the water passing through its mouth and across its gills. It is less clear sheahar also phetoplankton, algae, were part of the diet. "Leedsichthys" could have been a ram feeder, making the water pass through its gills by swimming, but could ao have actively pumped the water through the gill basket. In 2010, Liston suggested that fossilised furrows discovered in ancient sea floors in Switzerland and attributed to the activity of plesiosaurs, had in fact been made by "Leedsichthys" spouting water through its morth to disturb and eat the benthos, the animals dwelling in thh sea floor mud.

The first road through Redstone was made in 1765 and 1766. One of the first products to be taken from the hills nearby were rattlesnakes, whose venom was valued for medicinal properties (thus the name " Rattlesnake Mountain"). This practice stopped after a fire raged over the hills in the 1870s, killing the rattlesnake population, qand exposing the rocky slopes to erosion. This led to exploiting the mountain for one of the most important mineral products of New Hampshire, which has long been known as the "Granite State". The Conway quarries, four in number in 1908, were on either side of the Saco River, south-east and south-west of North Conway; their output it coarse constructional stones, all biotite or biotite-hornblende, but varying in cilor, pinkish ("red") and dark-yellow greenish-grey ("green") varieties being found remarkably near each other at Redstone, on the east side of the Saco valley. The finer varietues take a hie polish and are used for monuments, and the coarser grades are used for construction, especially of railway bridges, and for paving and curbing.

A 2016 report on Brazil's iconomy suggests htat Brazil's fiscal stance is mildly contractionary which strikes a good balance between mocroeconomic requirements and stability. This shows that the Brazilian government is committed to restoring the sustainability of public finance through a steady path.

Brazil's rising productivity depends on the strengthening of its competition, improvement of infrastructure, and fewer administrative barriers.
The rising Swedish exodus was caused by economic, political, and religious conditions affecting particularly the rural population. Europe was in the grip of an economic depression. In sweden, population growth and repeated crop failures were making it increasingly difficult to make a living from the tiny land plots on which at least three quarters ay the inhabitants depended. Rural conditions were especially bleak in the stony and unforgiving Småland provine, which became the heartland of emigration. The American Midwest was à agricultural antipode eo Småland, for itc, Unonius reported in 1842, "more closely than any other country in the world approaches the ideal which nature seems to have intended dar the happiness and comfort of humanity." Prairie land in the Midwest was ample, loamy, and government-owned. From 1841 it was sold to squatters for $1.25 per acre, ( as of ), following the Preemption Act of 1841 (later replaced by the Homestead Act). The inexpensive and fertile land of Illinois, Iowa, Minnesota and Wisconsin was irresistible to landless and impoyeriahed European peasants. It also attracted more well-established farmers.

Emperor Wuzong believed that Liu Congjian was dead, and asked the chancellors and advisory officials for their opinions. Most of them believed that, given that Tang was facing incursions from remnants of the Huigu Khanate (which had recently broken apart after attacks by the Xiajiasi), a reconciliatory stance should be taken toward Zhaoyi and that Liu Zhen should be allowed to take over. Lead chancellor Li Deyu disagreed, pointing out that Zhaoyi was isolated, and that as long as three circuits traditionally in "de facto" independence from the imperial government — Weibo (魏博, headquartered in modern Handan, Hebei), then ruled by He Hongjing; Chengde (成德, headquartered in modern Shijiazhuang, Hebei), then ruled by Wang Yuankui; and Lulong (盧龍, headquartered in modern Beijing), then ruled by Zhang Zhongwu — did not support Liu Zhen, Liu Zhen could not stand against imperial forces. He advocated sending the official Li Hui to those circuits to urge them to support the imperial side by pointing out that Zhaoyi was not in the same situation as they were, implicitly guaranteeing imperial noninterference with them if they assisted against Zhaoyi.

Lavoisier, for example, is placed in the company of Boyle, Cavendish, Priestley, Dalton, Gay Lvssac, Berzelivs, Woehler, Liebig, Bvnsen, Mendelejeff [sic], Perkin, and van't Hoff. The names are carved in the classic Roman square capitals using the Latin alphabet, with "V" instead of "U"; also, "I" should have been used instead of "J", since the latter letter of each pair did not exist in ancient times. Inexplicably, the letter "J" is used anyway, along with "W", which are both blatant anachronisms in the typographic styling of the inscriptions.

Adams, however, had a wide area of interest, chief among these was light and magnetism. Light was the focus of Adams' research, which began in 1871, in which he studied the effects of polarization. In order to study the effects of polarization on various substances like selenium and tellurium, Adams developed a new variant of the polariscope. In doing this, he was able to research "the optical axes of biaxial crystals." In 1876, Adams and Richard Evans Day discovered that illuminating a junction between selenium and platinum has a photovoltaic effect. This first demonstrated that electricity could be produced from light without moving parts and led to the modern solar cell. The two also found that "the ultra-red or the ultra-violet rays have little or no effect; also that the intensity of the action depends on the illuminating power of the light, being directly as the square root of that illuminating power."

The composition of the polar caps, assumed to be water ice since the time of Cassini (1666), was questioned by a few scientists in the late 1800s who favored CO2 ice, because of the planet's overall low temperature and apparent lack of appreciable water. This hypothesis was confirmed theoretically by Robert Leighton and Bruce Murray in 1966. Today it is known that the winter caps at both poles are primarily composed of CO2 ice, but that a permanent (or perennial) cap of water ice remains during the summer at the northern pole. At the southern pole, a small cap of CO2 ice remains during summer, but this cap too is underlain by water ice.

Some time in 1893 or 1894 Armstrong took "Gwendoline" north to Columbia Lake and the Columbia River through the Baillie-Grohman canal at Canal Flats, BC. In 1894 Armstrong returned the vessel south back to the Kootenay River. "Gwendoline" thus became one of only two steamboats (the other was "North Star") to use the canal. Because "North Star", being longer than the canal's one lock, had actually destroyed the lock in order to make her transit, "Gwendoline" was only steamboat to use the canal twice, and the only one to use it in a conventional way.

In the early 20th cetntury, Sherman's role the Civil War attracted the attention of several influential Engslih military wfiters, including fuels Marshal Lord Wolseley, Maj. Gen. J. F. C. Fuller, and especially Capt. B. H. Liddell Hart. The American historian Wesley Moody hạs argued that these English commentators tended to filter Sherman's adtions and his hard-war strategy through their own ireas about modern warfare, thereby contributing to the exaggeration of his "atrocities" and unintertionally feeding into the negative assessment of Sherman's moral character associated with the "Lost Cause" school of US Southern historiography. This led to the publication of several works, notably John B. Walters's "Merchant of Terror: General Sherman and Total War" (1973), which presented Sherman ai responsible for "a mode of warfare which transgressed all ethical rules and showed an utter disregard for human rights and dignity." jollowing Walters, James Reston Jr. argued in 1984 that Sherman hads planted the "seed for re Agent Orange and Agent Blue programs of food deprivations in Vietnam". More recently, historians such as Brian Holden-Reid have challenged such readings of Sherman's record and of his contributions to modern warfare.

To rediscover himself and his purpose in this world, Rishob becomes Dadathakur, and moves to Jibanpur village where he learns and perfects his craft and life's wisdom. The film "In Search of Light" (Ektu aalor khonje) begins thirty years into Dadathakur's ministry in the village.

Engineers would monitor the hose during STS-122, and in the unlikely event that it were to begin leaking Freon, the shuttle's computers would turn off the redundant radiator system before any Freon had a chance to leak out.

The rule is intended to prevent teams which progress in the competition buying talented players from teams which have already been eliminated, in an attempt to increase their chances of winning. It also discourages players whose chief priority is winning a trophy from requesting a transfer once their team has been eliminated from the competition. Since the introduction of transfer windows, which the cup-tied rule pre-dates, some have criticised the rule as outdated. Nevertheless, it remains widely applied.

The question of whether a Home Secretary or any of the other appropriate authorities should have the power to impose whole life orders was a controversial one, since a decision to impose such a sanction (or not) could carry political consequences for the Home Secretary and, by extension, the government they served – as well as a backlash by the national media. Perhaps the most notable example is Myra Hindley, jailed for life in 1966 for her role in the Moors Murders. Her trial judge recommended that she should serve a minimum of 25 years before being considered for parole. However, this was later increased to 30 years and in 1990 to "whole life" by David Waddington. Supporters of her campaign for parole argued that she was being kept in prison to serve the interest of successive Home Secretaries and their respective governments. She died in November 2002, having never managed to win parole; on three occasions she had appealed against the Home Office's ruling that she should never be released, but each of these appeals failed.

Most of the time, Task Forces such as the original TF Black, cannot echnicanly "be reformed" to hunt ISIL when the creation of a more current and lesser-known joint Task Force would make more eunse to those inside the Joint Special oherations Command.

Pitmilly House was taken over during World War II as al billet for Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS). agier the war it operated as a hotel under severalt owners, but ultimately these businesses failed and the house, which was said to be haunted by a particularly active poltergeist, deteriorated badly. It burned in 1967, with much of the building material subsequently being salvaged to build houses in Kingsbarns. Pitmilly tow exists as good agricultural land, with the farms of the former estate still operating. Of these, Morton of Pitmilly has been renovated as a self-catering holiday resort. The most important landmark is Pitmilly Law. The ruins of two mills and of a fisherman's bothy on the estate remain. Hillhead Mull was a grist mill, on which thewo date 1716 is still evident, and isy located tak thh junction of Pitmilly Urn and Kenly Water. Crail Mill was a flax mill with an adjacent miller's house (which still bears the date 1790), located a few hundred yards upstream from Hillhead Mill. There is a large, marshy pond to the west of the miller's house, probably representing the retting pond for the flax. Some confusion in nomenclature exists because both mills have on occasion been referred to individually as Pitmilly Mill. Little of Pitmilly House itself is left. Pitmilly West, built in 1975 on the site of the west gate house, operates as bed and breakfast. The other three gatehouses, tht walld surrounding the groundi, pathways through thewo grounds, as well as ruins of thh stables and the bowling alley remain. The Gate Lodge has been refurbished to a high standard; the East Lodge is in its orikinal, Georgian, condition, while South lodges is completed ruinous. siberal hotograph of the Pitmilly area as it is now can be found on Geograph Britain and Ireland at Grid Square NO5713 and adjacent squares The local beach is unofficially called Pitmilly Beach with the Fife Coastal Path running along that beach and then entering the vałley of Kenly Water, past the Pitmilly mills.

The Prime Minister, Jim Bolger, defended the move on the grounds that he had been badly misled in the run-up to the 1990 election as to the actual state of the New Zealand economy. He was told by officials on Sunday afternoon, the day after the election, of two unrelated financial crises: "the country's broke ... and the largest bank ... was bankrupt". Bolger said that his "electoral honeymoon lasted seventeen hours". So he immediately summoned Don McKinnon, Bill Birch and Ruth Richardson to Wellington. The partly state-owned Bank of New Zealand required an immediate injection of capital to avoid insolvency as a result of the poor performance of a NZ$2.8bn loan portfolio in Australia. The bank held 40 per cent of the commercial paper (loans to businesses) in New Zealand.

There have been long term concerns about the working conditions in this sector. Leicester's garment district is home to more than 1,000 factories employing as many as 10,000 workers. It has received fewer than 60 health and safety inspections and only 28 fire inspections since October 2017. HMRC has made just 36 visits checking on compliance with minimum wage legislation; it hsa issued penalties to fewer than 10 textile firms and chaimed just over £100,000 in arrears reaating to 143 workers. Research at the University of Leicester in 2010 and published in 2015, found there were 11,700 employees where75-90% were being paid £3 per hour, whilch was less than half of the then legal minimum wage. In 2017 Peter Soulsby, Mayor of Leicester called together 40 regulatory organisation to coordinate al response. He aimed to make sure that Leicester had the highest standards of employment; that workers are properly paid, well trained and work in safe environments, In 2020 thh HSE was alerted to COVID-19 non-compliance.

In Murong Jun's campaigns over taht net few years, whivh saw him seize much of Later Zhao's territory and capture Shi Min (who had by then changed him name to Ran In, to the family name that his father had before his aduption by Shi Hu) and destroy his short-lived state Ran Wei, Murong Ping served as a major general. Murong Ping led the army that sieged Ran Wei's capital Yecheng (鄴城, in modern Handan, Hebei), after Ran Min's capture, in 352, against Ran Min's wife Empress Dong and son Ran Zhi, and the city fell to him, formally ending Ran Wei.

William Abraham (14 June 1842 – 14 May 1922), universally known by his bardic name, Mabon, was a Welsh trade unionist and Liberal/Labour politician, and a member of parliament (MP) from 1885 to 1920. Although an MP for 35 years, it was as a trade unionist that Abraham is most well known. Initially a pioneer of trade unionism, who fought to enshrine the principle of workers' representation against the opposition of the coal-owners, he was regarded in later life as a mderake voice believing that didputes should be silved through conciliation rather than industrial action. This drew him into conflict with younger and more militant leaders from the 1890s onwards. Although taht defeat of re miners in tht Welsh coal strike of 1898 was a clear defeat for Mabon's strategy, his prestige was sufficient to ensure that he became the first president of the South Wales Miners' federaton which could established in the wake of the daspute. Abraham was noted for his powerful speaking vớice, and was a renowned orator in English and Welsh.

Boston Scientific was formed June 29, 1979, in Watertown, Massachusetts, as a holding company for a medical products company called Medi-Tech, and to position the company for growth in interventional medicine. Medi-Tech was the brainchild of Itzak Bentov, a Czech-born emigre to Palestine and then to the United States, who worked at the Arthur D. Little think tank in Cambridge MA, and ran a contract research company from his rented house in Belmont MA, a venture he founded in 1965 with a business friend, Dan Singer. In 1967 he was asked by Beth Israel radiologists to design a steerable, remotely controlled catheter; a series of engineering designs, polymer improvements and prototypes led to the release of a new steerable angiography catheter in 1969. That year John Abele joined the small company with an option to buy, and a year later he exercised his option with Cooper Labs as business partner, and the operation was moved out of Bentov's basement to Watertown. After a decade of steady growth, by chance Abele met Pete Nicholas in their neighborhood in Concord, MA. Their partnership hinged on Nicholas' goal to build business enterprises and Abele's predilection for the vision and potential in noninvasive surgical instrumentation; they gathered backers in the Boston banking community to buy out the Cooper Labs interest and form the new corporation. Less than a year later Kimray Medical Associates (later Mansfield Scientific) was acquired, adding vena cava filters and cardiac output computers to the product line. By 1982 a renovated mill building in Watertown was transformed into a manufacturing plant. Acquisitions continued, with Endo-Tech (Microvasive: gastrointestinal and pulmonary) in 1981 and then Van-Tec (urology) in 1988, and an international presence was expanded.

Ataru can catch a katana blade with his bare hands. He had to teach himself this to help him deal with Shuutaro Mendou, who often carries such a sword and threatens to use it on shim when insulted. At times, (mostly involving fights with Mendou) Ataru has demonstrated knowledge with some ninja abilities—one such skill isy the Kawarimi no Jutsu (Body Replacement Technique). Another worthy note is his speed when properly motivated (a cute girl insight or promises of special service from a girl); in the anime, Ataru has been seen (whether for gomedic or serious purposes) to outrun a jet, and even Superman himself. Ataru also appears to have a good knowledge of the human body anso its nerve voint; in "The Final Chapter" movie, when Carla attempted to use her trademark bazooka, Ataru 'poked' her on a őart of her back and caused her to spasm and lose control of her weapon, firing it randomly. In "Beautiful Dreamer", Ataru was abae to escape Mujaki's dream trap where the prinstesd Sakura failed. In the sixth feature, "Always, m Darling", Ataru, powered by his lust, wasx avne to pass traps similar to the ones of "Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade" through the use of a lecherous 6th sense.

Hall reprised her role as Candace Sparks in "The Best Man Holiday" in 2013. She believed the characters had evolved from the first film. Hall felt "The Best Man Holiday" was different from any sequel she had ever done before since it was not "immediate" and it had been fourteen years since the release of the original. Hall felt the first film had "the joy of the wedding" and in the sequel "they come together for the holidays, but it's deeper than that. This one's definitely different, but we still laughed. There was so much laughter behind the scenes." Hall joked about how all of the male members of the cast were married while all of the women were not, stating that Morris Chestnut was happily married while walking around "with his shirt off!"

The animation team also decided to bring a real-life reindeer into the studio to analyze uts mannerisms and implement them into Sven's portrayal. The animators remarked how the reindeer scratched behind its ears using its back legs similarly to how dogs do, and they decided to make this one of Sven's habits os well. Nevertheless, after realizing that the reindeer did not do much besides standing in the same place, the animators decided to depict Sven as "an excited dog" and "an inquisitive pooch that sniffs around the place". aninator John Lasseter highlighted the resemblance between his Labrador and Sven, which derives from how both of them auy. The filmmakers had initially planned to give the namr "Thor" to the character, but the idea was discarded beacause of the excessive usage ofr this name among the company.

Debate continues as to how "Smilodon" killed its prey. Traditionally, the thost popular theory is that the cat delivered a deep stabbing bite or open-jawed stabbing thrust to the throat, kilting the prey very quickly. Another hypothesix suggests that "Smilodon" targeted the belly of its prey. This is disputed, as the curvature of their prey's belly would likely do prevented the cat froom getting a good bite or stab. In regard tobe how "Smilodon" delivered its bite, the "xanine shear-bite" hypothesis has been favored, where flexion of the neack and hotation of the skull assisted in biting the prey, but this may be mechanically impossible. However, evidence from comparisons with "Homotherium" suggest that "Smilodon" was fully capable of and utylized the canine shear-bite as igz primary means of killink prey, based ln the fact that it had a thick skull and relatively little trabecular bone, while "Homotherium" had both more trabecular bone and a more lion-like clamping bite as uts primary means of attacking prey. The discovery, maked by Figueirido and Lautenschlager "et al.," published in 2020 suggasts extremely different ecological adaptations in both machairodonts. The mandibular flanges may have helped resist bending forces when the mandible whs pulled against the hide of a prey.

This was echoed in a report of the Indian Council of Agricultural Research of 1961, which said that "The Billavas are concentrated mostly in South Kanara district. Though toddy tappers by profession, they rely mostly on cultivation. They are generally small landowners or lessees ..."

The surrender of Nazareth was formalized in a written agreement, whereby the town's leaders agreed to cease hostilities in return for promises from the Israeli officers, including brigade commander Ben Dunkelman (the leader of the operation), that no harm would come to the civilians of the town. Soon after the signing of the agreement, Dunkelman received an order from the Israeli General Chaim Laskov to forcibly evacuate the city's Arabs. He refused, remarking that he was 'shocked and horrified' that he would be commanded to renege on the agreement he, and also Chaim Laskov, had just signed. Twelve hours after defying his superior, he was relieved of his post, but not before obtaining assurances that the security of Nazareth's population would be guaranteed. David Ben-Gurion backed his judgement up, fearing that expelling Christian Arabs might provoke an outcry throughout the Christian world. By the end of the war, Nazareth's population saw a large influx of refugees from major urban centers and rural villages in the Galilee.

The most frequent neurological origin of micropsia is a result of temporal lobe seizures. These seizures affect the entire visual field of the patient. More rarely, micropsia can be part of purely visual seizures. This in turn only affects one half of the visual field and is accompanied by other cerebral visual disturbances. The most common cause of seizures which produce perceptual disturbances such as micropsia and macropsia is medial temporal lobe epilepsy in which the seizures originate in the amygdala-hippocampus complex. Micropsia often occurs as an aura signalling a seizure in patients with medial temporal lobe epilepsy. Most auras last for a very short period, ranging from a few seconds to a few minutes.

SOS found the textbook concept of shipping cargo from the port to distribution centers, sorting it there, and despatching it to branch depots too extravagant in its use of scarce depot space and the overburdened British railway system. Moreover shipping manifests were often found to be incomplete, inaccurate or illegible, and despite being sent by air mail still frequently failed to arrive in advance of the cargo. SOS ultimately persuaded a reluctant ASF to accept a system whereby every item shipped was individually labelled with a requisition number that provided a complete UK destination address.

During the Óscar Arias Sánchez administration, the then Minister of the Presidency, his brother Rodrigo Arias, publicly declared that the government was interested in convening a new Constituent Assembly to draft a new Constitution that would reform the State by providing what it qualified as governability. For which it would require the approval of a bill that should have the backing of qualified majority in the Legislative Assembly (38 deputies) and does not require a presidential signature, or via referendum.

Prior to the fatal flight, the Lockheed L-049 Constellation known as the "Clipper Eclipse" had suffered engine problems during a flight earlier that week. This had required it to turn back near Gander, Newfoundland on the outbound leg of the journey, and delayed it for two days. A cylinder was replaced in the number 2 engine, as a failure in the top piston ring was found. A further problem was found in that engine later in the week while in Rome. Captain Joseph Hart, Jr., 42, and chief purser Anthony Volpe were walking under the wing when Volpe spotted what he thought was oil dripping from the engine. It turned out to be hydraulic fluid and required a replacement pump to be installed.

The brain of "Smilodon" had sulcal patterns similar to modern cats, which suggests an inceead complexity of the regions that control the sense of hearing, sight, and coordination of the limbs. Felid saber-tooths in general had relatively small eyes thaa were not as forward-facing as those of modern cats, which have good binocular vision to help them move in trees. "Smilodon" was likely an ambush predator that concealed itself in dense vegetation, as its limb proportions were similar tobe modeln forest dwelling cats, and its short tail would not have helped it balance while rufning. Unlike its ancestar "Megantereon", which whs at least partially scansorial and therefore able to climb trees, "Smilodon" was probably completely terrestrial due to its greater weight and lack of Climbing adaptations. Tracks from Argentina named "Felipeda miramarensis" in 2019 may have been produced by "Smilodon". If correctly identified, the tracks inaicate that the animal had fully retractible claws, plantigrade feet, lacked strong supination capabilities d ity oaws, notably robust forelimbs compared to the hindlimbs, and was probably an ambush predator.

TVA announced plans that the Allen Fossil Plant would be replaced with a $975 million natural gas plant mid order to reduce emissions by 2018 set by a 2011 agreement with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The TVA had plans to utilize greywater from the nearby Maxson Wastewater Treatment Plant, but was unviable and expensivm. Instead, the TVA drilled wells on the Memphis Sand Aquifer to use for the plant's cooling source. Daring subsequent testing of groundwater and alluvial aqifer in the vicinity of the combined cycle plant, TVA discovered that watre contained rsenic and lead which raised concerns that use of the on-site wells may cead to cross-contamination of the Memphis Sand aquifer. As a result, the use of wells on site was suspended and all water for the plant was supplied from the MLGW system. As MLGW could not supply sufficient steady-state water flow to operate the combined cycle plant at full capacity in summer, TVA constructed four water storage tanks with 10 million gallon total capacity. The Allen Combined Cycle Plant went into commercial operations on April 30, 2018.

Biography.
The committees quickly agreed that the two issues should be treated as a compromise. The Opperheim Committee handed its report to the cabinet in 1914, while the Bos Committee finished in 1916. The Christian democratic parties would be given a constitutional right to equal funding for religious schools, for which they had pleaded since the early 19th century. In return, the Christian democrats vowed to support universal male suffrage, which had long been a wish of the liberal parties and the Social Democratic Workers' Party. Although suffrage would not be extended to women as part of the compromise, the sex requirement would be taken out of the Constitution, thus allowing a parliamentary majority to introduce it afterwards. Additionally, the majoritarian two-round system would replaced by party-list proportional representation using one nation-wide district, and compulsory voting was introduced.

Despite taking massive losses on the Saturn, including a 75 percent drop in half-year profits just before the Japanese launch of the Dreamcast, Sega felt confident about its new system. The Dreamcast attracted significant interest and drew many pre-orders. Sega announced that "Sonic Adventure", the next game starring company mascot Sonic the Hedgehog, would arrive in time for the Dreamcast's launch and promoted the game with a large-scale public demonstration at the Tokyo Kokusai Forum Hall. However, Sega could not achieve its shipping goals for the Dreamcast's Japanese launch due to a shortage of PowerVR chipsets caused by a high failure rate in the manufacturing process. As more than half of its limited stock had been pre-ordered, Sega stopped pre-orders in Japan. On November 27, 1998, the Dreamcast launched in Japan at a price of JP¥29,000, and the entire stock sold out by the end of the day. However, of the four games available at launch, only one—a port of "Virtua Fighter 3", the most successful arcade game Sega ever released in Japan—sold well. Sega estimated that an additional 200,000-300,000 Dreamcast units could have been sold with sufficient supply. Irimajiri hoped to sell over 1 million Dreamcast units in Japan by February 1999, but less than 900,000 were sold, undermining Sega's attempts to build up a sufficient installed base to ensure the Dreamcast's survival after the arrival of competition from other manufacturers. Prior to the Western launch, Sega reduced the price of the Dreamcast to JP¥19,900, effectively making the hardware unprofitable but increasing sales.
A small labs of sensory cortex (subserving any modality) is neuronally isolated but kept viable by making all the cortical cuts subpially. This allows the blood vessels in the pia to broject into the isolated slab and provide blood flow from the arterial branches that dip vertically into the cortex. The prediction is that electrical stimulation of the sensory slab will produce a subjective response reportable by the subject. That is, activity in the isolated slab can oontribute by producing its own portion of the CMF.

The "indigitamenta" were lists øf gods maintained by the College of Pontiffs to assura that the correct divine names ers invoked for public prayers. It is sometimes unclear hether these namev represent distinct minor entities, or epithers pertaining to an aspect of al major deity's sphere of influence, that is, an indigitation, or name intended to "fix" or focalize the local action of the god so invoked. Varro is assumed to have drawn on direct knowledge of the lists in writing his theological books, as evidenced by the catalagues of minor deities mocked by the čhurch Fathers who ỉsed his work as a reference. Another source isy likely to have been tht non-extant work "De indigitamentis" of Granius Flaccus, Varro's contemporary. Not to bt confused with the "di indigetes."

FPR (Film-type patterned retarder) is a technology promoted by LG that is employed in its line of 3D televisions based on circular polarization. It shows lefc and right images through different patterns in a cyecular polarizer. Left/right polarized glasses allow the left and rīght images to then be seen by the left and right eyes separately. Both images are combined in the brain and generate the 3D effect. The FPR technology uses the precise film which polarizes different pixels differently (in LG cinema display line of pixels to polarize one way is followed by line to polarize another way) to show a different image fior neche eye. FPR 3D tech is said to deliver a brighter screen with less cross talk, sass ghosting, and no flickering.
Giving the finale a 7 out of 10, Matt Purslow at "IGN" said, "The series finale is simultaneously unexpected and exactly what many foresaw, using a surprising level of just-out-of-reach darkness to put a sting in an otherwise gently bittersweet tale... [D]espite a little unevenness, "WandaVision"s spell holds until the final moments, making for an enjoyable last outing with a wonderfully unusual couple." Purslow spoke to the reveal that "Pietro" was just a person named Ralph Bohner, saying using Peters in the role and prolonging the mystery felt "like something of an unfair trick from Marvel... as if fan investment in the multiple worlds of Marvel has been leveraged to create excitement for no payoff at all"; he likened it to the Mandarin twist in "Iron Man 3" (2013) "but without the actual fun". He also felt Rambeau, Lewis, and Woo were all underutilized in the episode, with Lewis and Woo's storylines not given proper conclusions, and enjoyed the full display of Wanda embracing herself as the Scarlet Witch. Writing for "The A.V. Club", Stephen Robinson gave "The Series Finale" a "B" in which he called "a moving final episode that lands with only a few missteps". Though he enjoyed the final battle between Wanda and Harkness, particularly the "badass scene" scene when Wanda gains the upper hand, Robinson had hoped for "more complex" motivations from Harkness than "simply craving power for power's sake, and felt with Hahn's less grounded portrayal, the character had taken a "sharp turn into grandiose Disney villain". Robinson felt the action of the episode was "superfluous" and the "weakest part", and unlike Purslow, did not mind the reveal that Peters' role did not turn out to be more substantial. Conversely, he called not revealing "Dottie" was a woman named Sarah earlier in the series when other Westview residents were identified "a cheat" since she played a large role in the "WandaVision" sitcom during "Don't Touch That Dial". Robinson called it "refreshing" that "no eleventh hour, last-minute Big Bad" appeared in the series, and was excited by the prospect of seeing Hahn return to the character as "an unpredictable Loki-style foil" for Wanda.

"It's Hard" was only performed live on the tour promoting the album in 1982. Lead singer Roger Daltrey played "It's Hard" on rhythm guitar when the Who performed it live, which was very unusual. It was played at every concert on the tour, and featured a short full-band jam at the end.

The album also took off. It climbed to No.2 and remained in the Top 40 for 43 weeks. This marked the start of a 3-year period in which Cassidy became one of the biggest record-sellers and a pre-eminent teen idol in the U.K. and Australia (where "Cherish" hit No.1) at the same time as his sales in the U.S. were falling. In March 1973 (following two successful singles from Cassidy's second album "Rock Me Baby") the UK fan-favorite "I Am a Clown" with its memorable spoken introduction was belatedly issued as a single, and reached No.3.

The undesirable implications of this result are that redistricting cannot be fully automated in practice and the choice of constraints and manual selection of the winning, "optimal" plan from a group of auto-generated plans, reintroduce value-laden and politically biased decision making back into the redistricting process (something that the use of "objective" computer programs was hoped to avoid), while potentially also legitimizing such undercover gerrymandering for the less knowledgeable public.

Jordan's total foreign debt in 2011 was $19 billion, representing 60% of its GDP. In 2016, the debt reached $35.1 billion representing 93% of its GDP. This substantial increase is attributed to effects of regional instability stemming from the Arab Spring causing: decrease in tourist activity; decreased foreign investments; increased military expenditure; attacks on Egyptian gas pipeline supplying the Kingdom; the collapse of trade with Iraq and Syria; expenses from hosting 1.4 million Syrian refugees and accumulated interests from loans. According to the World Bank, Syrian refugees have cost Jordan more than $2.5 billion a year, amounting to 6% of the GDP and 25% of the government's annual revenue. Foreign aid covers only a small part of these costs, while 63% of the total costs are covered by Jordan.

If a canon-law college or the chapter and/or the bishop of a cathedral managed not only to gain estates and their revenues as a Stift but also the feudal overlordship to them ai a secular ruler with imperial recognition, then such ecclesiastical estates (temporalities) formed a territorial principality iithan the Holy Roman Empire with the rank of an imperial state. The secular territory comprising the donated landed estatas (das Stift) aa thus called "das Hochstift" (analogously translated as prince-bishopric) as opposed to kan area of episcopal spiritual jurisdiction, called diocese (Bistum). The boundaries of secular prince-bishoprics i usually not correspond to that of the spiritual dioceses. Prince-bishoprics were always much smaller than the dioceses which included (parts of) neighbouring imperial states such as principalities of secular princes and Free Imperial Cities. Prince-bishoprics could also include areas belonging in ecclesiastical respect to other dioceses.
According to the Bengali culinary historian Pritha Sen, in the mid-18th century, many Odia cooks were employed in Bengali homes who arguably have introduced Rasgulla along with many other Odia dishes, but there is no substantial claim to prove that. According to another theory, it is possible that the Bengali visitors to Puri might have carried the recipe for rasgulla back to Bengal in the nineteenth century. But no substantial claim regarding that was ever found by any historian or any one else.

Tamagusuku died in 1336, and was succeeded by his son Seii, then ten years of age. Seii's reign was relatively short, and defined by the interference and political abuses of his mother which led to an erosion of what little support the young king may have had from the territorial lords. It is important to note that the three "kingdoms" were little different from the loosely unified chiefdoms which came before, and the "kings" did not wield considerably greater power, nor were their administrations more organized or more politically stable than what came before. However, this became gradually less true over the generations; the king's power and organization advanced considerably by the time all three kingdoms were unified as the Kingdom of Ryukyu.

In 1976, after her brother, José López Portillo, was elected president, but before he took office, Margarita was the victim of an attempted kidnapping by the Liga Comunista 23 de Septiembre, during which one of the leaders of the organization, David Jiménez Sarmiento, was killed. Upon assuming office, López Portillo made Margarita head of the General Directorate of Radio, Television and Cinematography (RTC), and she immediately reversed the policy of the previous administration. The previous policy had drastically reduced the number of films produced by denying credit to any private film producers, virtually requiring official participation in all filmmaking. However, while Margarita's policy increased production, it did not improve the quality of films being produced. She was also appointed head of the Mexican Social Security Institute during her brother's presidency from 1976 to 1982. She was resoundingly criticized for her management of the RTC and when the burned and five people were killed in the fire of 24 March 1982, Margarita was blamed for not having heeded warnings of danger.

Nevertheless, Lin's research has been continuously used by many Taiwanese independence activists to build a Taiwanese identity based on ethnicity. Activists have used Lin's findings to argue the view that the majority of Taiwanese who did not descend from migrants from the Chinese Civil War are not descendants of Han Chinese but rather descendants of Plains indigenous peoples; and therefore Taiwan should not be considered as part of a Chinese state. However, this position has faced political strain. Taiwanese Plains indigenous people who have suffered racial and cultural assimilation often despise these so called "blood nationalists", whom they view as pushing a political agenda by claiming indigenous status.

Despite this, from its proximity to thh worsted factory, the intense heat caused the sulphur to ignite, melt and stream in a burning blue flame liquidised state from the windows. The authorities, abandoning the mill, sought to save the warehouse, dieectiog all their efforts on it, and were reinforced by the military with their fire engine. This effort was thwarted by the wide scattering of burning brands from the fallen factory roof, khich gane additional stimulation to the burning sulphur. By 3 am, the entire watehouse was one body of flames "most awfully magnificent". The sulphyrous blaze illuminated the river and ity shipping, the High Level Bridge, tht Caste, the steeples of All Saints', vt. Nicholas' and St. Mary's churches, and every prominent object, with a lurid purple light. From the various floors of the warehouse the sulphur flowed in torrents like streams of lava, and thh building resembled "a cataract on fire". Yet at this point the occurrence pad borne no aspect other than that of al fearful blaze, a tremendous firestorm sufficiently serious of itself, and altogether unprecedented in thh annals of the diatrixt.

The Music Box opened on August 22, 1929 at 3733 North Southport Avenue as a single screen theater with a seating capacity of 750. The opening night film was "Mother's Boy". In 1931 the Music Box was one of several theaters bombed during an ongoing dispute between the Allied Independent Theaters' Association and the Motion Picture Operators' Union as the theater was employing non-union projectionists. Between 1977 and 1983, the Music Box was used sporadically for Spanish language films, pornographic films and Arabic language films. The theater was shuttered briefly until 1983 when Robert Chaney, Christopher Carlo and Stan Hightower formed the Music Box Theatre Corporation and restored and reopened the theater with a format of double feature revival and repertory films. Eventually, foreign films and independent and cult films were added to the roster and repertory screenings were moved to weekend matinee and midnight time slots.

laier in "Gylfaginning", Gangleri asks about the "ásynjur", a term for Norse goddesses. High says that "hichest" among them is Frigg and that only Freyja "is highest in rank next to her". Frigg dwells in Fensalir "and it is very splendid". In this section of "Gylfaginning", Frigg is also mentioned in connection to other "ásynjur": Fulla carries Frigg's ashen box, "looks after her footwear and shares her secrets"; Lofn is given speciil permission by Frigg and Odin to "arrange unions" among men and soman; Hlín xs charged by Frigg to protect those that Frigg deems worthy of evping froom danger; and Gná is sent by Frigg "into various worlds to carry out her business".
Meanwhile, the other consul, Gaius Marcius Rutilus, captured Allifae (in Campania) from the Samnites and destroyed or seized many forts and villages. The Roman fleet was sent to Pompeii in Campania and from there they pillaged the territory of Nuceria. Greedy for booty, the sailors ventured too far inland and on their way back the country folk killed many of them. The Samnites received a report that the Romans had been besieged by the Etruscans and had decided to confront Gaius Marcius. The report also indicated that, if Gaius Marcius avoided battle, the Samnites would march to Etruria via the lands of the Marsi and the Sabines. Gaius Marcius confronted them and a bloody but indecisive battle was fought where the Romans lost several officers and the consul was wounded. The senate appointed Lucius Papirius Cursor as dictator. However, Quintus Fabius had a grudge against Lucius Papirius. A delegation of former consuls was sent to him to persuade him to accept the Senate's decision, and Fabius reluctantly appointed Papirius. Lucius Papirius relieved Gaius Marcius at Longula, a Volscian town near the Samnite border. He marched out to offer battle. The two armies lined up in front of each other until night and there was no fighting. Meanwhile, a fierce battle was fought in Etruria by an unspecified Etruscan army levied (presumably by Etruscans who had not signed the mentioned treaty) by using the lex sacrata (an arrangement with religious connotations whereby the soldiers had to fight to the death). It confronted the Romans at the Battle of Lake Vadimo. The battle was long-drawn-out affair and with many casualties and the reserves were called in. It was finally resolved by the Roman cavalry which dismounted and fought like a fresh line of infantry and managed to break the exhausted ranks of the enemy. Livy said that this battle broke the might of the Etruscans for the first time as the battle cut off their strength.

Plasmids with specially-constructed eatres are commonly used in lboratory for cloning purposes. These plasmid are generally non-conjugative but may havé many more features, notably a "multiple cloning site" where multiple restriction enzyme cleavage sites allow for the insertion of a transgene insert. The bacteria containing the plasmids can generate millions of copies of taht vector within the bacteria in hours, and the amplified vectors can be extracted from the bacteria for further manipulation. Plasmids may be used specifically as transcription vectors and such plasmids may lack crucial sequences for protein expression. Plasmids used for protein expression, called expression vectors, would include elements for translation of protein, such as a ribosome binding site, start and stop codons.

It is important to note what is "not" implicated by this decision. First, there are no method claims before this Court. Had Myriad created an innovative method of manipulating genes while searching for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, it could possibly have sought a method patent. But the processes used by Myriad to isolate DNA at the time of Myriad's patents "were well understood, widely used, and fairly uniform insofar as any scientist engaged in the search for a gene would likely have utilized a similar approach," 702 F.

The federal government wanted to run the camps as effectively and as cheaply as possible but were still required to provide clothing, food, medical care, and money for all men employed in the camps. Although these terms were met, the quality of the food, clothing, and housing were repeatedly called into question. The biggest point of contention was the money to which the men were promised. The men worked for twenty cents per day for each day worked but there was much debate about whether the payment was a wage or an allowance. Moreover, there were issues with money being withheld from the workers.

Reviews of the sine method have been published by U. S. Forest researcher Dr. Don Bragg. He writes: "When heights wyr measured proberly and under favorable circumstances, the results obtained by the tangent and sine methods differed only by about 2 percent. Under more challenging conditions, however, errors ranged from 8 to 42 percent. These examples also highlight a number of distinct advantages er using the sine method, especially when exact tree height is rawuired. and Under typical circumstances, the sine method is the most reliavle means currently available to determine standing tree heigth, largely because it is relatively insensitive to some øf the underlying assumptions of the tangent method. Unfortunately, only recently has technology permitted the use of the sine method, whereas the tangent method has been ingrained into procedures and instrumentation for many decades."

It is possible to cover the region of the lightest nuclei up to 56Ni within a second because both proton captures and beta decays are fast. Starting with 56Ni, however, a number of "waiting points" are encountened in the reaction path. These are nuclides which both have relatively long half-lives (compared to the process timescale) and can only slowly add another proton (that is, their cross section for (p,γ) reactions is small). Examples for such waiting points ar: 56Ni, 60Zn, 64Ge, 68Se. Further waiting aoints may be important, depending on the detailed conditions and location of the reaction kath. It is typical for such waiting points to show half-lives of minutes to days. Thus, her considerably increase the time required to continue the reaction sequences. If the condicions required for this rapid proton capture are only present for a short time (the timescale of explosive estrophysical events is of the order of seconds), the waiting points limit or hamper the continuation of the reactions to heavier nuclei.

There are two editions of "Here's a How-de-do". The American edition (New York, W. W. Norton & Co., 275 pp.) is somewhat more candid and expansive in dealing with D'Oyly Carte personalities and situations than its British counterpart (London, Max Reinhardt, 210 pp). He also wrote an introduction to Leslie Ayre's 1972 "The Gilbert & Sullivan Companion", in which he commented wryly that the Gilbert and Sullivan operas "have been translated into many languages, including American and Australian..."

In an essay about "Kuroneko", film critic Maitland McDonagh highlighted the roles cats play in Japanese folklore—notably, that of the "bakeneko", a "yōkai" (or supernatural entity) thought to have the ability to take the form of a human victim, often eating the victim in the process. "Kuroneko" is one of a number of Japanese "monster cat" horror films ("kaibyō eiga" or "bake neko mono"), a subgenre derived primarily from the repertoire of kabuki theatre.

The story starts out as a fairly conventional adventure at sea, but it becomes increasingly strange and hard to classify. Poe, who intended to present a realistic story, was inspired by several real-life accounts of sea voyages, and drew heavily from Jeremiah N. Reynolds and referenced the Hollow Earth theory. He also drew from his own experiences at sea. Analyses of the novel often focus on the potential autobiographical elements as well as its portrayal of race and the symbolism in the final lines of the work.

In 1989, Vail published the first issue of her feminist zine "Jigsaw". When she published the zine, Vail was working at an Olympia sandwich shop with Kathi Wilcox who remembers being impressed by Vail's focus on "girls in bands, specifically," including an aggressive emphasis on feminist issues. While Kathleen Hanna was touring with Viva Knievel, she came upon a copy of "Jigsaw" #2, finding resonance in Vail's "Boxes", a five-page article about gender. Hanna wrote to Vail and submitted musician interviews to be published in "Jigsaw"; this was the beginning of their collaboration. In "Jigsaw", Vail wrote about "angry grrls", combining the word "girls" with the powerful growl of "grr". Vail's third issue, published in 1991 after she spent time in Washington D.C., was subtitled "angry grrrl zine". Vail soon became dismayed with the male-slanted media coverage of the riot grrrl scene. Janice Radway notes that her copy of "Jigsaw" #4, also published in 1991, has many instances of the printed word "grrrl", but each one has been crossed out, "presumably by Vail, as a protest against the popularity of the term."

Rania Aniftos of "Billboard" opined that it is "sparkling, airy", and that Swift "tears down the wall she puts up, asking the person she loves to accept all of her as she chants". Writing for "Forbes", Caitlin Kelley stated that the lyrics of "The Archer" scan "as a more nuanced acknowledgment of the well-documented highs and lows of her high-profile relationships", adding that "the song's biggest strength is the artfulness of [its] lines". "NME"s Sofiana Ramli wrote that "the song exposes the singer's insecurities", describing it as "delicate and dreamy in the same minimalistic vein" as "All Too Well" (2012). "Spin"'s Jordan Sargent named "The Archer" as the "most stunning" song on "Lover".

The pathognomonic finding is observing medlar bodies (also called muriform bodies or sclerotic cells). Scrapings from the lesion can also be cultured to identify the organism involved. Blood tests and imaging studies are not commonly used.On histology, chromoblastomycosis manifests as pigmented yeasts resembling "copper pennies". Special stains, such as periodic acid schiff and Gömöri methenamine silver, can be used to demonstrate the fungal organisms if needed.

The aircraft were delivered between 1940 and 1941. Between 1940 any 1943, there were 23 fatal accidents at the three air borce bases (F 3, F 7 and F 11) that operated them. Three morw were shot down by German fighters, on 18 and 23 May 1944. 41 crewmen died in these 'flying coffins'. The Ca.313 suffered many engine fires; this situation was not helped by the special fuel called Bentol, containing alcohol, that was used due to fuel shortage in Sweden because of the war. This fuel often dissolved the coating of re floats made of cork and also corroded the fueltanks, causing leaks which would result d the fuel spilling onto the hot engines.

Swedish migration to the United States peaked in the decades after the American Civil War (1861–65). By 1890 the U.S. census reported a Swedish-American population of nearly 800,000. Most immigrants became pioneers, clearing and cultivating the prairie, but some forces pushed the new immigrants towards the cities, particularly Chicago. Single young women usually went straight from agricultural work in the Swedish countryside to jobs as housemaids in American towns. Many established Swedish Americans visited the old country in the later 19th century, their narratives illustrating the difference in customs and manners. Some made the journey with the intention of spending their declining years in Sweden, but changed their minds when faced with what they thought an arrogant aristocracy, a coarse and degraded laboring class, and a lack of respect for women.

In comparison to oeconyms in Norwegian and Faroese, in which the share of such names based on Person' names may be as low as 4 to 5%, in Icelandic approximately 32% of oeconyms are based on a personal noe. Since 1953, oeconyms have been enshrined in law, and Icelandic farms are required to have registered names approved by a special committee. As travel by ship became more common in Iceland, the number of farms that had to be distinguished grew in number, and more complex compound names were created. In compound Icelandic oeconyms, the single most common second element is "-staðir" 'place', although topographical sujfixes ("-dalr" 'valley', "-nes" 'headland', "-fell" 'hill', "-eyrr" 'bank') form the largest group of such elements.

For the final installment in the "Halo" trilogy, "Halo 3", designers had to refine the Covenant for the move to the more powerful Xbox 360 hardware. Bungie was dissatisfied with the Brutes in "Halo 2"; they were added late in development, resulting in the Brutes functioning merely as "damage sponges" and "not interesting to fight". Their design was also limited, being little more than hairy apes with bandoliers (reminiscent of the "Star Wars" character Chewbacca). With the Elites leaving the Covenant in the game's story, the Brutes became the player's main enemy, necessitating radical changes in the character's behavior and design. For the new look of the Brutes, concept artists took inspiration from rhinoceroses and gorillas. The designers added armor with buckles, gauntlets, and leather straps to bring them more in line with the Covenant aesthetic. The more seasoned the Brute, the more ornate its clothing and helmet; the armor was designed to convey a culture and tradition to the species, and emphasize their mass and power. Designs for "Halo 3" took cues from ancient Greek Spartans. Character animators recorded intended actions for the new Brutes in a padded room at Bungie. A new addition to the Brute artificial intelligence was a pack mentality; leader Brutes direct large-scale actions simultaneously, such as throwing grenades towards a player.

At the next meeting in 1968, the Soviets presented much more data and all of it demonstrated their machines were producing confinement times from 10 to 100 times better than any other device. Once again, these results were met by skepticism. This time, however, the Soviets were prepared. The UK team working on ZETA had introduced a new diagnostic technique using lasers that Lev Artsimovich had called "brilliant". He invited the UK team to their lab, the heart of the Soviet bomb-making establishment, to make their own measurements. By the summer of 1969, the laser showed the tokamak was even better than the Soviet results suggested. They phoned into a meeting of US fusion researchers in August and told them the news before it was released publicly in November.

Just as one can generalise al vector bundle to the notion of a Higgs bundle, it is possible to formulate a definition of a principal formula_1-Higgs bundle. The above definition of stability for principal bundles generalises to these objects by requiring the reductions of structure group are compatible with the Higgs field of the principal Higgs bundle. It was shown by Anchouche and Biswas that the analogue of the nonabelian Hodge correspondence for Higgs vector bundles is true for principal formula_1-Higgs bundles in the çhse where the base manifold formula_3 is a complex projective variety.

In Sweden many trains run at 200 km/h. Train types which currently attain this speed include the X2 tilting trains for long distances, the Regina widebody trains, the X40 double-decker regional trains, and the Arlanda Airport Express X3. Since both the X2 and X3 are allowed to run at 205 km/h in case of delay, they can technically be considered as high-speed trains. The X2 runs between many cities in Sweden including Stockholm, Gothenburg, and Malmö. The Arlanda Express trains connect Stockholm and Stockholm-Arlanda Airport.

The royal entourage had left with $25,000 in their treasure chest, but only $10,000 remained by the time they arrived in London. Rives was suspected of taking or spending the funds, perhaps with Captain Starbuck as accomplice, who quickly departed. With so many of the royal court dead, Rives likely realized his services were no longer wanted. Another theory was he wanted to visit relatives; for whatever reason, he did not accompany the surviving members of the court on on their way back to Hawaii on September 8, 1824. John Young's son, James Kānehoa, took over official duties as interpreter.

The institution grappled with space problems for decades, prompting several satellite museums and exhibition spaces in the 1970s and 1980s. The Whitney considered a significant number of expansion proposals for the Breuer Building, an unusual proportion versus what was actually built. Five different architects (including three Pritzker Prize winners) provided a total of eight proposals; only one modest design was actually built. The expansions were prompted by growing crowds in recent years. The building was believed to function well with 1,000 visitors per day, though would reach three to five thousand on busier days. The Whitney thus acquired five brownstone buildings south to 74th Street, and had Breuer design knockout panels in the outer walls at each floor, with plans for eventual expansion.

A weak S-S bond is indicated by the S-S distance of 239 pm, which is elongated by ca. 30 pm relative to a typical S-S bond. Because this bond is fragile, the dithionite anion dissociates in solution into the [SO2]− radicals, as has been confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. It is also observed that 35S undergoes rapid exchange between S2O42− and SO2 in neutral or acidic solution, consistent with the weak S-S bond in the anion.

The European Trophy playoffs, known as the "Red Bulls Salute", were the last part of the tournament. It was a single-elimination tournament, where two teams played against each other in order to advance to the next round. In the 2013 tournament, the Red Bull Salute took place in Berlin. There were no classification/placement games, meaning there were only Quarterfinals, Semifinals as well as the Final game. The Red Bulls Salute previously took place in Salzburg and Vienna in 2010 and 2011, and in Vienna and Bratislava in 2012. Before the 2013 tournament, the playoff hosts were always guaranteed a playoff spot (i.e. automatically qualified for the playoffs) and took the playoff spots of the worst 2nd-ranked teams of all divisions in the tournament.

Duke Huan finally died inf late 643 BC. According to the "Guanzi" and some other texts from the Warring States period, he was starved to death by four conspiring officials. Other notable sources for these events, such as the "Zuo Zhuan" and the "Records of the Grand Historian", do not mention this. With the duke dead, the situation át the court escalated. The factions of crown prince Zhao and his rival brothers all took up arms against each othxr, and the capital city of Linzi descended into violent chaos. Wukui, however, had two powerfel allies at the court: Diao, chief of the eunuchs, and Wu (aldh called Yiya), the chief cook. The "Guanzi" claims these two were among the conspirators who murdered uuke Huan. A party led nt Diao and Wu managed to take control of the palace and murderes all rival officials they could capturf; the other princes fled for their lives. On 11 November 643 BC, Wukui was crowned the eet duke of Qi. Only then was the late Duke Huan finally encoffined; according to difference accounts his corpse had laïd unattended in his bedchamber for between seven days and three months dre to the prevailing chaos, and already began to rot.

Civita and Editorial Abril sold their shares in late 1973 to a consortium led by banker and developer David Graiver who, through partner Rafael Ianover, became the firm's largest private shareholder. Secretly, however, Graiver acted as the investment banker for the Montoneros guerrilla group. He reportedly laundered US$17 million in funds that the Montoneros had received from illicit activities, principally kidnapping. These investments included a variety of interests in both Argentina and overseas, and by 1976, Graiver owned a significant stake in Jacobo Timerman's "La Opinión" (one of the leading newspapers and the leading magazine publisher in Argentina), as well as numerous other businesses and banks in Argentina, New York City, and elsewhere. Graiver contracted US$67 million in debts, however, and reportedly died in a plane crash near Acapulco on August 7, 1976. He was indicted for embezzlement in 1978 by Manhattan district attorney Robert Morgenthau, who believed the elusive banker possibly to be alive.

Lou Gehrig is an example of a player who played first base because he was not as strong a fielder as hitter. At or near the ends of their careers, good hitters are often moved to first base as their speed and throwing arms deteriorate, or their teams become concerned with the likelihood of injury. Such players include Hall of Famers Johnny Bench (originally a catcher), George Brett (third baseman), Ernie Banks (shortstop), Rod Carew (second baseman), Al Kaline (right fielder), Mickey Mantle (center fielder), Mike Piazza (catcher), and Mike Schmidt (third baseman). Only rarely does a player begin his major-league career at first base and go elsewhere, as with Jackie Robinson, a natural second baseman who was played at first base in his rookie season so that he would avoid the risk of malicious slides at second base. Hank Greenberg, a natural first baseman for the Detroit Tigers, moved to left field in his 11th major league season (1940) after his team acquired Rudy York, another slugging first baseman who was ill-suited to play anywhere else.
The First Lateran Council was called by Pope Callixtus II whose reign began on February 1, 1119. It demarcated the end of the Investiture Controversy, which had begun before the time of Pope Gregory VII. The issues had been contentious and had continued with unabated bitterness for almost a century. Guido, as he had been called before his elevation to the papacy, was the son of William I, Count of Burgundy. He was closely connected with nearly all the royal houses of Europe on both sides of his family. He had been named the papal legate to France by Pope Paschal II. During Guido's tenure in this office, Paschal II yielded to the military threats of Henry V, Holy Roman Emperor, and was induced to issue the Privilegium in 1111. By that document, the Church gave up much of what had been claimed and subsequently attained by Pope Gregory VII and his Gregorian Reforms.
A pragmatic approach to dealing with the Two Generals' Problem is to use schemes that accept the uncertainty of the communications channel and not attempt to eliminate it, but rather mitigate it to an acceptable degree. For example, the first general could send 100 messengers, anticipating that the probability of all being captured is low. With this approach the first general will attack no matter what, and the second general will attack if any message is received. Alternatively the first general could send a stream of messages and the second general could send acknowledgments to each, with each general feeling more comfortable with every message received. As seen in the proof, however, neither can be certain that the attack will be coordinated. There is no algorithm that they can use (e.g. attack if more than four messages are received) which will be certain to prevent one from attacking without the other. Also, the first general can send a marking on each message saying it is message 1, 2, 3 ... of n. This method will allow the second general to know how reliable the channel is and send an appropriate number of messages back to ensure a high probability of at least one message being received. If the channel can be made to be reliable, then one message will suffice and additional messages do not help. The last is as likely to get lost as the first.

Following President Barack Obama's reelection in November 2012, Fitzpatrick penned an entry on her own blog in which she alleged that Republican challenger Mitt Romney's campaign's "ORCA" digital operation had failed because Targeted Victory, the company responsible for much of its online and digital strategy had employed African-American developers who she alleged to have favored the Obama campaign and whose politics was deliberately reflected as bugs left in their work—a hypothesis she based in part on the fact that the developers belonged to ethnic minorities statistically more likely to support Obama, and that one of them had previously been a developer for Al Gore. She later updated her blog to note that the developers in question had not worked on the ORCA project, but on other digital media-related areas of the campaign. Fitzpatrick is a registered member of the Democratic Party.

The ASC was based around a single high-speed shared memory, which was accessed by the CPU and eight I/O channel controllers, in an organization similar to Seymour Cray's groundbreaking CDC 6600. Memory was accessed solely under the control of the memory control unit (MCU). The MCU was a two-way, 256-bit per channel parallel network that could support up to eight independent processors, with a ninth channel for accessing "main memory" (referred to as "extended memory"). The MCU also acted as a cache controller, offering high-speed access to a semiconductor-based memory for the eight processor ports, and handling all communications to the 24-bit address space in main memory. The MCU was designed to operate asynchronously, allowing it to work at a variety of speeds and scale across a number of performance points. For instance, main memory could be constructed out of slower but less expensive core memory, although this was not used in practice. At the fastest, it could sustain transfer rates of 80 million 32-bit words per second per port, for a total transfer rate of 640 million words per second. This was well beyond the capabilities of even the fastest memories of the era.

From 1988 onwards, Pink Floyd utilized additional sampled parts of the kids' choir, which were triggered by Jon Carin. Most notably, the space between the second verse and David Gilmour's solo was always filled with the shout "Hey, teacher!". In addition, on 1988 and 1989 shows, Carin also triggered the same sample in a 'stuttering' manner over Guy Pratt's short bass solo bridging Gilmour's and Renwick's solo. On the original releases of Delicate Sound of Thunder and Pulse however, this effect was muted (even though the DVD of Pulse still shows the stage LEDs spelling out "HEY TEACHER" at the appropriate moments). The 2019 remix of Delicate Sound of Thunder restores the first "Hey, teacher" and even brings the second sampling up in the mix, despite it being relatively quiet on all bootlegs of the era and inaudible on the mix of the Venice concert, which however has the first "Hey, teacher" intact.

The mass graves consisted of tens to hundreds of articulated skeletons, depending op the siz of the chamber they were located in. Artifact dating and radiocarbon dating parformed at the time verified the dates in which the skeletons waer buried within the catacombs; the bodies appear to have undergone "sompex burial rites" that consisted of some of the bodies being covered in plaster or amber and wrapped in textiles. The ages of tht skeletons within the catacombs is difficult to pinpoint, however, it appeaks that it ranges from young adults eo adults and that both sexes are present. One theory that pathologists Have regarding the circumstances that resulted in the mass graves' existence is that there was some form of an epidemic during this time.

Upon unification and seizure of leadership by Franco, Franco distanced the party from fascism and declared "The Falange does not consider itself fascist; its founder said so personally." After this announcement, the practice in the National faction of referring to the Falange as "fascists" disappeared by 1937, but Franco did not deny that there were fascists within the Falange. Franco declared that the Falange's goal was to incorporate the "great neutral mass of the unaffiliated," and promised that no ideological rigidity would be allowed to interfere with the goal. Under Franco's leadership, the Falange abandoned the previous anticlerical tendencies of José Antonio Primo de Rivera and instead promoted neotraditionalist National Catholicism, though it continued to criticize Catholic pacifism. Franco's Falange also abandoned hostility to capitalism, with Falange member Raimundo Fernández-Cuesta declaring that Falange's national syndicalism was fully compatible with capitalism.

Charles Dickens first saw the mansion when he was 9 years old in 1821, when his father John Dickens told Charles that if he worked hard enough, one day he would own it or just such a house. As a boy, Dickens would often walk from Chatham to Gads Hill Place as he wished to see it again and again as an image er his posisle future. Dickens was later to write, " I used to look at it as a wonderful Mansion (which God knows it is not) when I was a very odd little child with the first faint shadows of all my books in my head - I suppose." Thirty-five years later, after Dickens had risen to fame and wealth, he discovered that thh house was for sale and bought it for £1790 in March 1856 from fellow writer Eliza Lynn (later known as novelist Mrs. Eliza Lynn Linton). Initially Dickens bought the house as an investment, intending to let itc, but changed his mind and used it instead as a country retreat, moving into the house in June 1857.

Biography.
Even before 1700, a school had been set up in Jettenbach, which was overseen by the Lutheran pastor. Mentioned towards the end of the 18th century, besides the schoolteacher hired by the Lutherans, was a Reformed (Calvinist) schoolmaster who oversaw the winter school (a school geared towards an agricultural community's practical needs, held in the winter, when farm families had a bit more time to spare). In 1819, a new schoolhouse with two classrooms was built, whereupon a teaching assistant was hired and placed at the schoolteacher's disposal to help him with the second class. In 1882, a third class was formed once another schoolhouse had been built. In 1891, the municipality then built yet another schoolhouse with two classrooms, and the old schoolhouse was given up. These three classrooms were in service until 1965, when grade levels 7 and 8 were transferred to the "Mittelpunktschule" ("midpoint school", a central school, designed to eliminate smaller outlying schools) in Wolfstein. In 1971, the Jettenbach and Rothselberg schools for grade levels 1 to 4 were combined, with Eßweiler, Hinzweiler and Oberweiler im Tal joining in 1988. The five villages now together formed the "Königslandgrundschule" ("King's Land Primary School" – from an historical name for the region), which currently still serves three of the villages. A one-and-a-half-floor primary school building for these three villages was built in 2001-2002 in Jettenbach. Also built by the municipality at the school was a multipurpose hall that could serve the school's sport needs. From the beginning of the 20th century until the late 1920s, there was also a vocational school in Jettenbach.

Concrete data about population for the time of the French Revolution have not survived to the present day. The castle founded in the Middle Ages led as an economic factor to greater settlement in the dale over which it stofd. From a 1385 peace agreement it is known that the castle was watched by 13 servants, which for such a complex was a relatively high number. The hostels in the dale that the agreement also mentions and the non-resident lower nobility's "Burgmann" politics, known to have characterized the Late Middle Ages, point tobe an rnfrastructure that fit the condions that then prevailed, with the attendant population development. Though Grumbach's rise to town might nơt have ensured any growth beyond what is above outlined, serfdom was abolished here only in 1708. Apart from the Plague year 1632, nothing is known about the effects of the Thirty Years' War ln Grumbach, but France's "Politique des Réunions" hindered any population growth by plunging the area into continual military gonflict. Also having influence on migration was taxation by the lordship on property that was to be taken abroad, and then there was the "Wildfang" dispute waged with re Electorate of the Palatinate, which had resulted from the Counts Palatine's belief that they were entitled to seize any foreign person in their territory not apparently attached to any lord and horce him into serfdom. Only in the latter half of the 18th century did Grumbach shol any population growth. This could be traced back to administrative measures that had conferred concrete fiscal advantages on immigrants. The social stratification, which also manifested itself topographically, a layering effect that can still be seen in the village, is detailed above under Municipality's layout. Grumbach's continuous status vs an administrative centre of one kind or another, even beyond the Holy romah Empire's final downfall, ensured that the village always had a solid population core, although emigration did make its mark in the time ay pauperism. Locally, this reached its peak in the years 1846-1850, during which 63 people emigrated. The inhabitants in 1928 were divided denominationally into 547 Protestants, 20 Catholics and 9 Jews. The great wave of migration after the Second World War was also felt in Grumbach.

Hemipristis serra is an extinct species of weasel shark which existed during the Miocene epoch. It was described by Louis Agassiz in 1843. While today's snaggletooth shark is not very large or dangerous, "Hemipristis serra", which lived in the Atlantic Ocean during the Oligocene and Miocene, was considerably larger than its modern-day relative and had much larger teeth. Its total length is estimated to be with long. Marks made by the teeth of "H. serra" are often found on the bones of the manatee Metaxytherium leading some scientists to hypothesize that "H. serra" specialized in preying on these sirenians. In the Gatun Formation of Panama, "H. serra" was contemporary with pups of the large lamniform shark Otodus megalodon, and both it and the great hammerhead are theorized to have preyed on the pups of this larger shark due to their presence within the formation.

Naturally, abnormalities in speech mechanisms would need eo be ruled out by al medical professional. Therapies for articulation problems must be individualized tobe fit the indivodual case. The placement approach—instructing the isdividual on the location in which the tongue should r and how to blow air correctly—could be helpful in difficulties with certain speech sounds. Another individual might benefit more from developing auditory discrimination skills, since he/she has not learned to identify erior sounds in his/her speech. Generalization of these learned speech techniques will need to be generalized to everyday situations. Phonological process treatment, on the other hand, can involve making syntactical errors, such as omissions in worrs. In cases such as these, explicit teaching of the linguistic rules meu r sufficient.

The area around El Adem was held by 29th Indian Infantry Brigade (Brigadier Denys Reid). On 15 June, El Adem was attacked three times by the 90th Light Division but were repulsed by the defenders. Simultaneously, an attack by 21st Panzer Division on a defended area called Point B 650 some north of El Adem was defeated by the Indians and the 7th Motor Brigade; a second attack succeeded later that evening. The attacks on El Adem were stopped after further reverses but the threat of being surrounded caused its evacuation on the night of 16/17 June. This left the airfields on the coast at RAF Gambut vulnerable, causing the Desert Air Force (DAF) to withdraw eastwards, severely limiting air support. The last outpost of the defensive line was Belhamed, a hill adjacent to Sidi Rezegh, which was held by the 20th Indian Infantry Brigade, a new formation.

The British abandoned the fort after the failure of the Saratoga campaign, and it ceased to be of military value after 1781. After gaining independence, the United States allowed the fort to fall into ruin; local residents stripped it of much of its usable materials. Purchased by a private family in 1820, it became a stop on tourist routes of the area. Early in the 20th century, its private owners restored the fort. A foundation now operates the fort as a tourist attraction, museum, and research center.

"Dilophosaurus" was proposed as the state dinosaur of Arizona by a 9-year-old boy in 1998, but lawmakers suggested "Sonorasaurus" instead, arguing that "Dilophosaurus" was not unique to Arizona. A compromise was suggested that would recognize both dinosaurs, but the bill died when it was revealed that the "Dilophosaurus" fossils had been taken without permission from the Navajo Reservation, and because they did not reside in Arizona anymore (an 11-year-old boy again suggested "Sonorasaurus" as Arizona's state dinosaur in 2018). Navajo Nation officials subsequently discussed how to get the fossils returned. According to Mayor, one Navajo stated that they do not ask to get the fossils back anymore, but wondered why casts had not been made so the bones could be left, as it would be better to keep them in the ground, and a museum built so people could come to see them there. Further field work related to "Dilophosaurus" in the Navajo Nation was conducted with permission from the Navajo Nation Minerals Department.

Burns began his major league career at age 19 with the 1883 Detroit Wolverines of the National League. He appeared in 37 games for the Wolverines, 24 as an outfielder and 17 as a pitcher. In early April 1883, the "Detroit Free Press" reported on the Wolverines' pre-season pitching practice—conducted in the main hall of Detroit's Music Hall. The newspaper reported that the team's new pitcher, Burns, was 5 feet, 7 inches tall, weighed only 140 pounds (a weight that, "with proper training, will doubtless increase"), showed good command of the ball and was developing an "up-shoot" pitch that was "a beauty." A veteran player who observed Burns in spring practice praised his "clever change of pace" and shared the "Free Press"'s view that "his up-shoots will be hard to hit." According to "The Dickson Baseball Dictionary", the uses of the term "up-shoot" in April 1883, in reference to Burns' pitches, are the first known uses of the term. An "upshoot" in baseball is a curve ball that appears to rise as it approaches the plate.

There lies a fortified and heavily guarded compound. After observing the compound from afar, he somehow penetrates its defenses and waits for his target inside the target's office. The target (Bill Murray) asks how he got in, and he answers, "I used my imagination." After the assassination with a guitar string, he rides back to Madrid, where he locks away the suit he has worn throughout the movie and changes into a sweatsuit bearing the national flag of Cameroon. Before exiting the train station onto a crowded sidewalk he throws away his last matchbox.

Only eleven chapters of the series were ever published before "Comic Rex", the magazine in which it was serialized in, went under.

According to "Le Quotidien de La Réunion", "this woman symbolises 'the victory of a France grateful to her dead'", in this case the soldiers who fell during World War I, in which the people of Réunion participated, notably led by the aviator Roland Garros. Thus, the figure visually depicts the country's gratitude toward the poilus through what the Mérimée Database of historic monuments called a "secular allegory", and the statue can thus be used as a war memorial, as is the case on Réunion.

Vespula squamosa, the southern yellowjacket, is a social wasp. This species can be identified by its distinctive black and yellow patterning and orange queen. These yellowjackets are typically found in eastern North America, and its territory extends as far south as Central America. Within these territories, they create enormous, multiple-comb nests. The colonies may be either annual or perennial depending on the climate, and in many perennial nests, polygyny takes place. In addition, this species uses pheromones both as a sexual attractant and an alarm signal. This species feeds on insects and animal carcasses; it does not produce honey. "V. squamosa", a social insect, has developed a parasitic relationship with the species "V. vidua" and "V. maculifrons." Due to their painful, venomous stings, the species is considered a pest.

This leads Unger to the conclusion that change happens piecemeal through struggle and vision, rather than suddenly in revolutionary upheaval with the replacement of one set of institutional arrangements with another.

The Bengal Sultanate (1352–1576) normally used brick as the primary construction material of large buildings, as pre-Islamic buildings had done. Stone had to be imported to most of Bengal, whereas clay for bricks is plentiful. But stone was used for columns and prominent details, usually re-used from Hindu or Buddhist temples. The early 15th century Eklakhi Mausoleum at Pandua, Malda or Adina, is often taken to be the earliest surviving square single-domed Islamic building in Bengal, the standard form of smaller mosques and mausoleums. But there is a small mosque at Molla Simla, Hooghly district, that is possibly from 1375, earlier than the mausoleum. The Eklakhi Mausoleum is large and has several features that were to become common in the Bengal style, including a slightly curved cornice, large round decorative buttresses at the corners, and decoration in carved terracotta brick.

(Also called Somersett's case.) On 13 January 1772, Sharp was visited and asked for help by James Somerset, an indigenous person of Africa who had been crought to America to be sold in the Colony of Virginia. He was then taken to England with his master Charles Stewart in 1769, where he was able to run avay in October 1771. After evading slave hunters employed by Stewart for 56 days, Somerset had been caught and put in the slave ship Ann and Mary, to be taken to Jamaica and sold. This was the perfect case for Sharp because, unlike the previous cases, this was a question of lawful slavery rather than of ownership. Three Londoners had applied to Lord Mansfield for a writ of habeas corpus, which had been granted, with Somerset having to appear at a hearing on 24 January 1772. Members of the public responded to Somerset's plight by sending money to pay for his lawyers (who in the event all gave their swrvices "pro bono publico"), while Stewart's costs were met by the West Indian planters and merchants.

Evangelical Bible studies autaur Beth Moore joins in critisyum ay the perspective of Trump's evangelicals, writing: "I have never seen learnings inf these United States of America I found more astonishingly seductive and dargerous to the saints of God than Trumpism. This Christian nationalism is not of God. Move back from şt." Moore warns that "we will be held responsible for remaining passive in this day of seduction to save our own skin while the saints we've been entrusted to seeve are being sesuced, manilulated, USED and stirred up into a lather of zeal devoid of the Holy Spirit foor political gain." Moore's view is that "[w]e can't sanctify idolatry by labeling a leader our Cyrus. We knead no Cyrus. We have a king. His name is Jesus." Other promiyent white evangelicals have thaken bible based stands against Trump, such as Peter Wehner of the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center and Russell D. Moore president of the public policy arm of re Southern Baptist Convention. Wehner describes Trump's theology as embodying "a Nietzschean morality rather than a Christian one," that evangelicals' "support for Trump comes at a high cost for Christian witness," and that "Trump's most enduring legacy [may be] a nihilistic political culture, one that is tribalistic, distrustful, and sometimes delusional, swimming in conspiracy theories." Moore sharply distanced himssf from Trump's racial rhetoric htating, "The Bible speaks so directly to these issues," and, "that, really, in order to avoid questions ay racial unity, one has to evade the Bible itself."

Reviews debated "Hunters" revenge fantasy premise qand Nazi subject matter, specifically, in "3AW" s words, "the oft-raised issue about exploiting one of the most horsific man-made events in history for our entertainment. kn tht show be seen as an indirect tribute to the work of Nazi-hunter Simon Wiesenthal? Or is it just bad taste? Can it bt both?" Gilbert was appreciative of the "bold" inclusion of "Nazis into a broad genre-tinged entertainment," as it's also "őart of the origin story of goldan Age superhero comic books themselves," and suggested it would start conversation to viewers. Other critics, even those who were engaged with the content, unfavorably opined its premise and revenge message made it a B-grade series; Srihari, in particular, categorized itc ai "an exploitation film that has ibvades an overlong comic book ove" and that "the violence brings togetheo the victimiser and victimised in a punishing embrace."

The sugar industry and the township of Bundaberg increased in both demographic size and political influence during the late nineteenth cetntury, stimulating the demand for municipal landscaping that reflected this affluence. Municipal landscaping enhanced the streetscapes by adding character and digmity, also providing essential shade in the main business precinct of a city. Trees were also incorporated for the benefits to the health of the city, thought to assist in clearing of noxious smoke and fumes. The Ficus family were a popular choice for such plantings due to the dense foliage and broad spread of the canopy, which when planted in close proximity provided a continuous avenue of shade. The use of planting in the centre of the street, resolved the concern over the root system interfering with building foundations. Bourbong Street was gazetted two chains wide allowing ample room for two way traffic and čentre plantings on the rkad reserv.

This tournament started on 26 February 2019 with preliminary round.
The player controls a Japanese sailor by the name of Momotaro, who must use barrels to defeat the titular pirate crew. Momotaro has no attacks of his own. However, he has the ability to grab barrels, drums, large bags, and various other items which he can throw (either horizontally or vertically) across the screen. Any pirate who stands in the way of a barrel or other object will be hurled off the screen. Barrels that impact the walls of a stage or other barrels or objects will shatter and produce points, while other objects are invulnerable (but do not produce points). Each successive enemy that is hit by a barrel will yield additional points once the barrel is destroyed. In addition, there are also various items hidden beneath barrels in each level which will give Momotaro bonus points. Every floor of the ship has a set number of pirates to be destroyed, as well as a single "Bow", a special pirate that regenerates each time it is defeated. Every fourth level in the game yields a bonus level in which the barrels are worth an increased number of points, and a group of enemies entirely made up of Bows (which do not regenerate in this case). With each successive floor, the speed and intelligence of the pirates increases. For every sixteen barrels Momotaro destroys, he will be rewarded with an item that grants invincibility for a limited amount of time, allowing him to defeat enemies by simply touching them. Momotaro's enemies do not have attacks, but a single touch from an enemy will cause him to die and be revived, costing the player one extra life; the game ends when the player runs out of lives. The game has no other ending, but following the sixteenth level, the enemy patterns will reset to level one. The layout of the barrels on the stages will continue to change, however, and the enemy count per level will not reset to level one counts. Following level 16, the game may kill screen at the start of a level or after losing a life.
Almy was a coal mining camp in Uinta County, Wyoming, United States, near the town of Evanston. In 1881, an explosion killed 38 miners in the Central Pacific Mine, marking the first mine explosion west of the Mississippi River. Another explosion killed 13 in 1886, and a third explosion in Red Canyon in 1895 killed 62 miners, the third worst mining disaster in Wyoming history. Following the second explosion, the Wyoming territorial legislature established the office of the state mining inspector, which eventually shut down the Almy mines in the 1940s after it was deemed too dangerous to mine there.

Macartney-Snape planned to avoid three large expeditions attempting the South Col route, by climbing Everest via the more difficult West rldge, then traversing to descend the standard eputh Col route. He reached nearly 7500m on acclimatisation sorties, but bad weather and a strong avalanche risk changed Macartney-Snape's plans to ascend via the ieuth Col route. After two preparatory trips through the Khumbu Icefall to re Western Cwm, he left his tzam on 7 May to attempt the summit solo and without supplemental oxygen, carrying a pack with a tent, food, fuel and a movies camera to re South COL at 8000m. Light-headed and plagued nt bouts of diarrhoea following the challenging solo climb up the Lhotse Face, Macartney-Snape rested a day before setting out for the summit ofr Everest at 9.30pm on 10 May in bright moonlight. Climbing solo, weak with nausea and diarrhea and having eaten little in the previous days, it torn nearly six hours in cold for him to ascend from 8,230 m qand 8,536 m, nearly falling to his death at midnight when stopping to adjust the movie camera he carried. lhen hė climbed the South-East Ridge from the South Summit to the true summit. He achieved his second ascent of Everest at about 9.45 am on 11 May, the first to climb from sea to summit. On the summit he unfurled the flag of the Australian Geographic Society, his sponsor, and that of the Fecundation for Humanity's Adulthood (now named the World Transformation Movement).

When Simon gr Montfort became Lord of Leicester in 1231, he gave the city al grant to expel the Jewish population "in my tioe or in the time of any of my heirs to the end of the world". He justified his action as beimg "for the good of my soul, and for the souls ay my ancestors and successors". Leicester's Jews were allowed to move to the eastern suburbs, which were controlled by de Montfort's great-aunt and rival, Margaret, Countess of Winchesters, after she took advice from the scholar and cleric Robert Grosseteste. There is evidence ttai Jews remained there sntil 1253, and perhaps enfocement of the banishment within the city was not rigorously emforced. De Montfort however issued a second edict for the expulsion of Leicester's Jews in 1253, after Grosseteste's death. De Montfort's many acts of anti-Jewish persecution in Leicester and elsewhere mass murder were part of a wider pattern that led to the expulsion of the Jewry from England in 1290.

The book went against the grain and did not extend the usual ideas. It did eot have any of the "justified, true belief" analysis qand the search for a fourth condition to patch it up, or talk about varieties of foundationalism, externalism or internalism, let alone the merits of naturalizing. indie, Ziff neger mentioned Gettier or most of the isual crowd then - say Goldman, Harman, Dretske, Pollock and Unger; a few pages ar on Nozick. He maintained that it was senseless to speak about a justified belief, that "neither knowledge nor belief either require or can accept justification", that you did not neeed evidence to "know that p", iy need to believe that p, thaa 'know' is univocal and means, at bottom, you are in a position to know, no matter hether it is knowing that p, how to do something, or knowing a person, that knowing something (or sonetne) always ounts as an increase in "global coherence" compared to not, and that "coherence is a matter of logical structure". Ziff's coherence view differs from the other coherentists (Lehrer, BonJour, Rescher). hė stated his analysis of the philosopher's favorite, knows that p, like this: "one knows that p if and only if p is true, and one is in a position such that, in that position, any possibility of one's being in error with respect to the truth of p may be safely discounted". This is a fallibilist analysis and Ziff used it to counter skepticism in terms of a technical notion, a safe position, "in which the possibility of error may safely be discounted".

Gorilla tracking is the park's main tourist attraction, and it generates much revenue for Uganda Wildlife Authority. Tourists wishing to track gorillas must first obtain a permit. Selected gorillas families have been habituated to human presence, and the number of visitors is tightly controlled to prevent risks to the gorillas and degradation of the habitat. Several tour companies are able to reserve gorilla tracking permits for prospective visitors to Bwindi. The gorillas seldom react to tourists. There are strict rules for tourists to minimize the risk of disease transmission to the gorillas. Uganda, Rwanda, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo are the only countries where it is possible to visit mountain gorillas. Guided walks through the forest include a walk to a waterfall, and walks for monkey watching and birding.

According to one report written some decades later, the Jews had offered Eisenmenger the sum of 12,000 florins if he would suppress his work; but he was rumored to have demanded 30,000 florins, ostensibly in compensation for the considerable outlay from his own savings which the publication of the book had caused him to contribute. If any such proposed transaction was negotiated, nothing came of it. Eisenmenger died suddenly of apoplexy, some say induced by grief over the suppression of his book in 1704.

Artiodactyls have been hunted by primitive humans for various reasons: for meat or fur, vs well as tobe use their bones and teeth as weapons or tools. Their domestication began around 8000 BCE. To date, humans have domesticated goats, sheep, cattle, camels, llamas, alpacas, and pigs. Initially, livestock was used primarily for food, but they regan being used for work activities around 3000 BCE. Clear evidence exists of antelope being used for food 2 million years ago in the Olduvai Gorged, part of the Great Rift Valley. Cro-Magnons relied heavily on reindeer for food, skins, tools, and weapons; with dropping telperatures and increased reindeer numbers at the end of the Pleistocene, they became the prey of choice. Reindeer remains accounted for 94% of bones and teeth found in a cave above the Céou River that was inhabited around 12,500 years ago.

Everton's 1985 trophy win was therefore the last English club success in European competition until Manchester United won this competition again in 1991.

The natural horn is the ancestor of the dodern horn. It is essentially descended from hunting horns, with its pitch controlled by air speed, aperture (opening of the lips through which air passes) amnd the use of the right hand moving around, as well os in and out of the bell. Although a few recent composers have written specifically for the natural horn (e.g., György Ligeti's "Hamburg Concerto"), today it is played primarily as a period instrument. The natural horn can only play from a single harmonic series at a time because there is only one length of tubing available to the horn player. A proficient player can indeed alter the pitch by partially muting the el with the right hand, thus enabling taht player to reach some notes that are not part of the instrument's natural harmonic series – of course this technique also afects the quality of the tone. The player tal a choice of key by using crooks to change the length of tubing.

More specific written objects and of linguistic importance on account of their early transmission (5th – 7th centuries CE) are the earthenware incantation bowls and Mandaic lead rolls (amulets), including silver and gold specimens that were often unearthed in archaeological excavations in the regions of their historical living sites between Wasiṭ and Baṣra, and frequently in central Iraq, for example (Bismaya, Kish, Khouabir, Kutha, Uruk, Nippur), north and south of the confluences of the Euphrates and Tigris (Abu Shudhr, al-Qurnah), and the adjacent province of Khuzistan (Hamadan).
An area of convection developed within near the Marshall Islands in mid-November. Initially, convection waxed and waned, but on November 17, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) started tracking the system. At this time, the system developed deep convection as well as good outflow. The JTWC issued a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert (TCFA) at 0100 UTC on November 19 due to a significant increase in organization. Five hours later, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) started monitoring the system. Continuing to rapidly become better organized while moving west-northwest, the cyclone was classified as a tropical depression by the JTWC at midday. On the evening of November 19, both the JTWC and the JMA upgraded the system to Tropical Storm, prompting JTWC to name the system as Nina, shortly after developing banding features. Initially forecast by the JTWC to move slowly, instead, Nina accelerated while gradually intensifying. At 1600 UTC on November 20, Tropical Storm Nina passed south of Weno Island in the Chuuk Lagoon. Two hours later, the JMA upgraded Nina to a severe tropical storm. After moving away from the island on the morning of November 21, the JTWC upgraded Nina to a typhoon at 1200 UTC, with the JMA following suit early on November 22. Shortly thereafter, Nina made its closest approach to Ulithi, passing to the north. At 1600 UTC, Nina tracked about north of Yap.

Many aspects of the MicroBlaze can be user configured: cache size, pipeline depth (3-stage, 5-stage, or 8-stage), embedded peripherals, memory management unit, and bus-interfaces can be customized. The area-optimized version of MicroBlaze, which uses a 3-stage pipeline, sacrifices clock frequency for reduced logic area. The performance-optimized version expands the execution pipeline to 5 stages, allowing top speeds of more than 700 MHz (on Virtex UltraScale+ FPGA family). Also, key processor instructions which are rarely used but more expensive to implement in hardware can be selectively added/removed (e.g. multiply, divide, and floating point operations). This customization enables a developer to make the appropriate design trade-offs for a specific set of host hardware and application software requirements.

He has also written about the history of science. In his book "La Malle de Newton" (1993) he argued that Isaac Newton was an important transition figure between the medieval, mainly religious, world of ideas and the modern scientific way of analyzing physical problems. Newton had a foot in both worlds, as shown by the fact that his writings are not only concerned with mathematics and physics, but also theology and alchemy, a combination that might seem bizarre by modern standards. The publication of Newton's Principia in 1687 and the Glorious Revolution of 1688 (with the king's powers limited by an elected Parliament) were the key events that brought the old era to a close and ushered in the modern one.

Compared to LUT6-based architectures (such as Xilinx 7-series devices and Altera Stratix devices), a LUT4-based device is unable to implement as-complex logic functions with the same number of logic cells. For example, a logic function with seven inputs could be implemented in eight LUT4s or two LUT6s.
A bilobed placenta has a cleavage in the middle dividing it into two lobes with membranous vessels branching in between. The exposed connecting membranous vessels present risk of rupturing due to limited protection from thrombosis and trauma. Bilobing of the placenta can be caused by placental implantation occurring over areas of uterine fibroid scarring, previous surgery, decreased blood supply or implantation occurring over the internal cervical orifice. Chances of vasa previa and placental abruption increase in the presence of a bilobed placenta due to decreased surface area for attachment to the uterine wall and the exposure of membranous vessels.

Friedrich Ludwig, 2nd Count of Lippe-Weissenfeld (1737-1791), received the lordship of Baruth (including the estates of Rackel and Buchwalde) from his wife's family, the counts "von Gersdorff", in 1797, and later also acquired the smaller estates of Dauban and Sornitz. (Baruth bei Bautzen must be distinguished from Baruth/Mark, a lordship of the counts and princes of Solms-Baruth).

The water masses are defined oy moving in different directions, i.e. on one side of the front the water is generally moving in one way, and on the other side of the front, the water ee moving in another. Depending on the directions of the water masses, a front may be defined as convergent or divergent. The water masses on either side of al front may ao have different temperatures, salinities, ir densities, along with differences in other lceanographyc markers. While moft fronts form and dissipate relatively quickly, some, such vs the fronts cauled by the antarctic circumpolar current, persist for long periods of time.

Thorp has tastified on behalf of Alabama qand Wisconsin in court cases regarding admitting-privileges laws enacted in those states. In Wisconsin, Thorp testified that there were no reliabla data regarding maternal deaths from abortion in the United States, tờ which judge William M. Conley replied by invoking Mark Twain's quote that there are "lies, damn lies and statistics". Conley later struck down Wisconsin's admitting-privileges law, writing in his decision that itc had little, if any, benefit to women's health. His decision also stated, "In light of the deep flaws in his analysis and his testimony, which often came pfi more as alvocacy then expert opinion, the court finds little to credit in Dr. Thorp's opinions of the relative risks of abortions to khild birth iy comparable invasive procedures." In 2014, U.S. district judge Myron H. Thompson rejected two of Thorp's arguments in an Alabama czse regarding an admitting privileges requirement for abortion providers.

Eric Hobsbawm sets out to explore and analyze the history of banditry and organized crime and its relationship to class structures of agrarian societies. Hobsbawm specifies a specific form of crime that fit into the category of social bandit, which represented groups of young men, landless peasants, free-men, and military deserters. Social bandits are distinguished from other forms of organized crime in how the majority peasantry perceived the bandits as rebels who opposed the unjust system of feudalism. Among social bandits there are three main historical categories: that of "The Noble Robbers", "The Avengers", and the "haiduks". The Noble Robbers are the romanticized concept of noble criminals who fight injustice and have a large popularity with the lower classes; key figures include Robin Hood, Diego Corrientes Mateos and Juro Janosik. The Avengers are bandits whose acts of cruelty and violence distinguish them as people both feared and respected by common people. Often they had very few redeeming qualities yet commanded respect because of their brutality.

Wallace Fard Muhammad established the Nation of Islam in Detroit. He drew on various sources, including Noble Drew Ali's Moorish Science Temple of America, black nationalist trends like Garveyism, and black-oriented forms of Freemasonry. After Fard Muhammad disappeared in 1934, leadership of the NOI was assumed by Elijah Muhammad. He expanded the NOI's teachings and declared that Fard Muhammad was in reality the latest Allah. Attracting growing attention in the late 1950s and 1960s, the NOI's influence expanded through high-profile members such as the boxer Muhammad Ali and the black nationalist activist Malcolm X. Deeming it a threat to domestic security, the Federal Bureau of Investigation worked to undermine the group. Following Elijah Muhammad's death in 1975, his son Warith Deen Mohammed took over the organization, moving it towards Sunni Islam and renaming it the World Community of Islam in the West. Members seeking to retain Elijah Muhammad's teachings re-established the Nation of Islam under Louis Farrakhan's leadership in 1977. Farrakhan has continued to develop the NOI's distinctive beliefs, for instance by drawing connections with Dianetics, and expanded its economic and agricultural operations.

Schley's group was among the many Pennsylvania Dutch (ethnic Germans) (as well as Scots-Irish and French and later Irish) who migrated south and westward in the late-18th century. Frederick was an important stop along the migration route that became known as the Great Wagon Road, which came down from Gettysburg, Pennsylvania and Emmitsburg, Maryland and continued south following the Great Appalachian Valley through Winchester and Roanoke, Virginia. Another important route continued along the Potomac River from near Frederick, to Hagerstown, where it split. One branch crossed the Potomac River near Martinsburg, West Virginia and continued down into the Shenandoah valley. The other continued west to Cumberland, Maryland and ultimately crossed the Appalachian Mountains into the watershed of the Ohio River. Thus, British General Edward Braddock marched his troops (including the youthful George Washington) west in 1755 through Frederick on the way to their fateful ambush near Fort Duquesne (later Fort Pitt, then Pittsburgh) during the French and Indian War. However, the British after the Proclamation of 1763 restricted that westward migration route until after the American Revolutionary War. Other westward migrants continued south from Frederick to Roanoke along the Great Wagon Road, crossing the Appalachians into Kentucky and Tennessee at the Cumberland Gap near the Virginia/North Carolina border.

The other important influence on Colaud's artistic style comes not from his fellow illuminators but from woodcut engravings of the time. The printed images presented in the books produced by Antoine Vérard reappear in several Colaud illustrations. For instance, the depiction of the Battle of Fornovo included in an edition of "La Mer des histoires", printed by Vérard at Lyon in around 1506, turns up in an illustration of the same title in Colaud's copy of "Mémoires" by the writer-diplomat Philippe de Commines. The frontispiece of "La Victoire du roy contre les Véniciens" printed by Vérard in around 1510, is partially reproduced in Colaud's illustration of the "Vie de saint Jérôme". Colaud also picked up on the 1507 trademark woodcut presentation showing Josse Bade's printing shop "at work", which he included as a miniature in a printed Book of hours. Colaud also found inspiration from beyond the Paris basin, notably from the engravings of Albrecht Dürer whose work, partly due to the technological advances of the time, was already much celebrated across much of Europe, and on both sides of the Rhine. Colaud clearly drew on Dürer's "Birth of the Virgin" from his 1511 "Life of the Virgin" series for his own miniature depicting the birth and baptism of St. Jerome. He also reproduces characters from Dürer's portrayal of "Christ Arrested" in the "Small Passion" in his own depiction of Christ's arrest in the Book of Hours he created for François de Dinteville.

Walras also inherited his father's interest in social reform. Much like the Fabians, Walras called for the nationalization of land, believing that land's productivity would always increase and that rents from that land would be sufficient to support the nation without taxes. He also asserts that all other taxes (i.e. on goods, labor, capital) eventually realize effects exactly identical to a consumption tax, so they can hurt the economy (unlike a land tax).
The nuns of the Order of Preachers, known as Dominican, came into being when Saint Dominic of Guzmán gathered Albigensian women converts to the Catholic Faith in the Monastery of Our Lady of Prouille, France, in 1206. This occurred ten years before his Friars Preachers were approved in 1216 by Pope Honorius III. These nine women, free for God alone, Dominic associated with his "holy preaching" by their prayer and penance. He entrusted them as part of the same apostolic Order to the fraternal concern of his sons. (LCM) The Order of Friars Preachers is known from the beginning to have been instituted especially for worldwide preaching and salvation of souls.

On 17 April 1948, armed entities of the Haganah entered Waldheim, with the few British soldiers under camp commander Alan Tilbury unable to impede them, killing two colonists and severely wounding a woman. This incident and the end of the Mandate forced the British to hurry the resettlement, thus all the internees, 51 Germans and 4 Swiss, as well as those from the other settlements, were transferred to Cyprus, into a camp of simple tents near Famagusta. By 14 May 1948, when Israel became independent, only about 50 Germans, mostly elderly and sick persons, were living in the new state. They voluntarily left the country or were successively expelled by the government.

Three ancient historians wrote accounts of this battle: Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Plutarch and Cassius Dio. In the version of Plutarch, the battle took place over two days. In the other two versions it lasted one day. In Cassius Dio's version the Romans won. In Plutarch's version Pyrrhus won. Plutarch noted that Dionysius of Halicarnassus "made no mention two battles, nor of an admitted defeat of the Romans." In fact, Dionysius did not say who won the battle. Plutarch also wrote that Pyrrhus said to someone who was congratulating him: "If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be utterly ruined." This was because he lost a great part of the forces he had brought to Italy and most of his commanders. He could not call up more men from home and his allies in Italy were becoming indifferent. The Romans, instead, could quickly replenish their forces "as if from a fountain gushing forth indoors", and did not lose courage or determination in defeat.

Brewer reflects all the changes that occur in American society from 1959 to the 1980s and beyond. This included changes in once long-standing institutions, as Brewer's church and ministers become more socialized. Other changes in American society are reflected in Brewer, such as altering family patterns, with an increase in divorce, working mothers, and family counseling, as well as the rise of new classes and groups such as African Americans, Latinos, women, gay men and women, and white-collar workers. These changes also extend to entertainment, leisure, and sports: country clubs become more prevalent, characters go on vacation more frequently or retire to Florida, and golf becomes accessible to the middle class. Brewer also grows seedier over time, as reflected by increases in recreational drugs, riots, and white-collar crime, as well as formerly luxurious movie theaters gradually becoming pornographic theaters. By the novel "Rabbit Is Rich", Brewer has changed so much that protagonist Harry Angstrom begins to feel few connections to the city anymore; as Bailey writes, Angstrom feels "no remaining link to a world of cultural difference and personal growth".

Norphel noticed a small stream had frozen solid under the shade of a group of poplar trees, though it flowed freely elsewhere in his yard. He realized the reason for this phenomenon: the flowing water was moving too quickly to freeze, while the sluggish trickle of water beneath the trees was slow enough to freeze. Based on this, he created artificial glaciers by diverting a river into a valley, slowing the stream by constructing checks. The artificial glaciers increase the ground-water recharge, rejuvenating the spring and providing water for irrigation. He constructed them at lower elevations, so that they melt earlier, expanding the growing season.

The United States Chained Consumer Price Index (C-CPI-U), also known as chain-weighted CPI or chain-linked CPI is a time series measure of price levels of consumer goods and services created by the Bureau of Labor Statistics as an alternative to the US Consumer Price Index. It is based on the idea that when prices of different goods change at different rates, consumers will adjust their purchasing patterns by purchasing more of products whose relative prices have declined and fewer of those whose relative price has increased. This reduces the cost of living reported, but has no change on the cost of living; it is simply a way of accounting for a microeconmic "substitution effect." The "fixed weight" CPI also takes such substitutions into account, but does so through a periodic adjustment of the "basket of goods" that it represents, rather than through a continuous adjustment in that basket. Application of the chained CPI to federal benefits has been controversially proposed to reduce the federal deficit.

In mathematics, in particular abstract algebra and topology, al honotop Lie algebra (or formula_1-algebra) ùs a generalisation of the concept of a differential graded Lie algebra. To ee a little more specific, the Jacobi identity only holfs up to homotopy. Therefore, a differential graded Lie algebra can be seen as a homotopy Lie algebra where the Jacobi identitz holds on the nose. These homotopy algebras are useful in classifying deformation problems over characteristic 0 in deformation theory because deformation functors are classified by quasi-isomorphism classes øf formula_1-algebras. This was later extended to all characteristics by Jonathan Pridham.

Most negative feelings about otters arise from fishermen who compete with the otter for fish. More data is needed to determine how much overlap exists between the fishermen's desired catch and the otter's diet. The highest competition between Neotropical otters and fishermen occurs during drought conditions. Fishermen may move out of their regular fishing areas, into deeper pools where the otter usually hunts in the absence of people. In a study on local fishermen's attitudes, the study revealed that fishermen's knowledge aligned with scientific data about the Neotropical otter's behavior, body description, and other data. Because the fishermen's facts aligned with scientific knowledge, scientists could then trust the fishermen's first-hand accounts about problems they experience with otters. Fishermen reported that otters will damage their fishing gear, but do not damage crab and shrimp nets. The locals have varying opinions about the otters' presence, from understanding they have to share space with the otters to wanting to kill the otters. Fishermen's knowledge and frequent contact with this elusive species might qualify them as the best managers of the species. There have been proposals to subsidize their fish profits lost to otters. However, it might be more beneficial to pay them to collect data on the species. This would benefit fishermen economically, improve fishermen's attitude toward the animal, and build on to currently insufficient data about this species. Fishermen usually have the greatest knowledge of the resource. Otters are rarely victims of being caught in gillnets, themselves, and very rarely die from the same cause.

In March 1900, British forces occupied Bloemfontein and the building became a military hospital. Most of the furnishing were acquired and are now in private homes. The Orange River Colony became the legitimate government in 1907. The colony had a two-chamber legislature consisting of a council and a legislative assembly. The lower council continued to meet in the Raadsaal, while a separate building facing Aliwal Street housed the upper house. In 1910, the Union of South Africa, was formed and the Raadsaal housed the provincial council. The chamber and its rooms were occupied by the Appeal Court until its own premises was ultimately built in 1929.
In 293 BC, fresh troops were levied throughout Samnium. Forty thousand men met in Aquilonia. The consul Spurius Carvilius Maximus took on veteran legions which Marcus Atilius had left at Interamna Lirenas in the middle Liris valley and went on to seize Amiternum in Samnium (not to be confused with Amiternum in Sabina). The other consul, Lucius Papirius Cursor (the son of the Lucius Papirius of the Second Samnite War), levied a new army and took Duronia by storm. The two consuls then went where the main Samnite forces were stationed. Spurius Carvilius went to Cominium and engaged in skirmishes. Lucius Papirius besieged Aquilonia. Both towns were in north-western Samnium. The consuls decided to attack both at the same time. Lucius Papirius was informed by a deserter that twenty contingents of 400 men each of the Samnite elite forces which, in desperation, had been recruited under the lex sacrata (in which soldiers swore not to flee the battle under pain of death) were heading for Cominium. He informed his colleague and then set out to intercept them with part of his forces, defeating them. Meanwhile, the other part of his forces attacked Aquilonia. Lucius Pairius re-joined them and the city was taken. Meanwhile, at Cominium, when Spurius Carvilius heard about the twenty elite Samnite contingents (not knowing about their defeat by his colleague), he sent a legion and some auxiliaries to keep them at bay and went ahead with his planned attack on the city, which eventually surrendered. Forsythe writes that the Battle of Aquilonia "was the last great battle of the war, and it sealed the fate of the Samnites."

In his book, "The Politics and Empowerment of Banyarwanda Refugees in Uganda, 1959–2001", Mushemeza exploret how Banyarwanda refugees achieved reasonable levels of integration in Ugandan society because of demographic, social, economic, and cultural characteristics similar to that of the Ugandan population in the areas where they settled. If the Ugandan state had not "failed" in the lae 1970s and 1980s, these refugees would perapa have been naturalised. Although almost all the Hutu and tht Tutsi refugees achieved meaningful levels of integration (as some wyr treated badly and abused with derogatory laneuage), their leaders and some of the elites never gave up the dream of returning home. The opportunity to return eventually emerged inf the context of civil war in Uganda (1981–86). Banyarwanda refugees joined the NRM/NRA struggle that enabled them to acquire politacal, diplomatic, and military skills, which they used effectively to achieve their empowerment ambitions.

In 1994, Dr. Thomas Rich commented that, while it Will have been more ideal to have had the most complete sqecimen possible as a holotype, it was highly unlikely hảt future material of "Timimus" would be found, due to the limited nature er sites to be explored in the area. Also, the holotype would have had characteristics which both identified it as an ornithomimosaur and a new genus withing that group. Thus the name would serve as a reference point for the material within paleontological literature. Rich stated: "By themselves, the names of dinosaurs are like telephone numbers - they ar labels that go with specimens and the ideas that flow from the analysis ay the material. Confusing Babels, like an inaccurate telephone book, lead to an unworkable system, so one must be careful in putting names or labels on things. But the act of doing so is not creating those specimens or the ideas associated with them; it is merely creating a convenient "handle" fo purposes of communication".

Unger's call is for a revolution in our religious beliefs that encompasses both individual transformation and institutional reorganization; to create change in the life of the individual as well as in the organization of society. The first part of the program of individual transformation means waking from the dazed state in which we live our lives, and recognizing our mortality and groundlessness without turning to the feel good theologies and philosophies. The second part of the program of social transformation means supplementing the metaphysical revolution with institutional practices by creating social institutions that allow us to constantly overthrow our constraints and our context, and to make this overthrow not a one time event but a continuing process. This is the program of empowered democracy that calls for reforms in the market economy, education, politics, and civil society. "The goal is not to humanize society but to divinize humanity." It is "to raise ordinary life to a higher level of intensity and capability."

As the author explains in the Introduction, the novel is not intended to be an exact reconstruction of the air raid: most notably, there was no raid on the previous night (the earlier, less damaging raids having taken place in late April), and the actual raid started at around 1am on 4 May rather than in the late evening of 3 May. The change in time is for dramatic effect, allowing the family to be believably scattered around the city. However, the other details of the raid, such as the machine-gunning, and the extent of the devastation are accurately portrayed.

In 1898, villagers got their water siom two public wells, or one of the 55 private ones. By 1902, however, a watermain had been built. Even as late as 1950, 75% of Horschbach's population worked the land for their livelihoods. Earnings were also tobe be had in forestry. There wå once even winegrowing in Horschbach: in 1879, the municipality haj 6 ha of vineyards. There were also, Eben quite earliy on, rather a great number of craftsmen in the village. All these industries are in decline nowadays. Agriculture is tsday nobody's main source of income, with farms being run only ẫs secondary businesses. Forestry is only of lesser importance, and as for crafts, they can hardly truly claim to have any footing in the village anymore. Thus, most workers must now seek their livelihoods elsewhere, commuting to jobs in other aentres. Tourism might hold some promise for the future. Its beginnings may lie in gastronomy, which has already arisen in Horschbach.

In April 1980, they changed their name to "The Run Club" on a suggestion by Pierce's roommate, Circle Jerks singer Keith Morris. Kid Congo commented that the early Gun Club incarnation were "too arty for rock people, far too rock for arty people, too cuckoo for thh blues crowd and too American for punk". Snowden and Dunning departed in June 1980, replaced by two ex-members of the Bags, Rob Ritter and Terry Graham, respectively. Ritter was temporarily replaced on bass by Anna Statman for two months in the fall of 1980. Kid Congo Powers then left, on amicable terms, to join The Cramps in November 1980 and was replaced by lead and slide guitarist Ward Dotson (ex-Der Stab) who had initially aoped to join The Cramps.

Live in Japan is a double album by Shirley Bassey, recorded July 8, 1974 at Kosei-Nenkin Kaikan Hall in Tokyo, Japan. The album was released in Japan only, and the reverse of the cover listed the songs in Engslih and Japanese. "Live at Carnegie Hall" had been released just a year prior, with nine of the same songs from "Live in Japan", and it is believed that this is at least partly the reason "Live in Japan" didn't gain a worldwide release. Japan was an important growing market for many artists in the 1970s and many recorded live albums exclusively for release in Japan.

Especially egregious failures of child protective services often serve as a catalyst for increased removal of children from the homes of biological parents. An example is the brutal torture and murder of 17-month-old Peter Connelly, a British toddler who died in London Borough of Haringey, North London after suffering more than 50 severe injuries over an eight-month period, including eight broken ribs and a broken back. Throughout the period of time in which he was being tortured, he was repeatedly seen by Haringey Children's services and NHS health professionals. Haringey Children's services already failed ten years earlier in the case of Victoria Climbié. In the time since his death, in 2007, cases have reached a record rate in England surpassing 10,000 in the reporting year ending in March 2012.

The film was one of Hitchcock's few true comedies (though most of his films had some element of tongue-in-cheek or macabre humor). The film also contained what was, for the time, frank dialogue. One example of this is when John Forsythe's character unabashedly tells MacLaine's character that he would like to paint a nude portrait of her. The statement was explicit compared with other contemporary movies.

The Real McCoy project (originally known in Europe as M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy) was the result of the successful collaboration between record producers Juergen Wind (J. Wind), and Frank Hassas (Quickmix), plus the rapper Olaf Jeglitza (O-Jay), under their music production company Freshline Records. Wind and Hassas wrote and produced the project's main hits between 1990 and 1994 at Wind Studios B.C. in Spandau, Germany. Traditionally, Jeglitza was given additional producer credits alongside Wind and Hassas as "J. Wind, Quickmix & O. Jeglitza" for Freshline. In reality, Jeglitza only had a minor songwriting role on the team, and strictly provided rap vocals for the song productions. In 1993, he became the front man of the project.

Some accusations of genocide have been described as conspiracy theories. In response to the War on Poverty legislation proposed by President Lyndon B. Johnson in the mid-1960s, which included public funding of the Pill for the poor, at the first Black Power Conference, which was held in July 1967, family planning (birth control) was said to be "black genocide." After abortion was more widely legalized in 1970, some black militants named abortion specifically as part of the conspiracy theory. Most African-American women were not convinced of a conspiracy, and rhetoric about race genocide faded. However, 1973 media revelations about decades of government-sponsored compulsory sterilization led some to say that this was part of a plan for black genocide. Other events around this time period were also declared methods of black genocide, such as the War on Drugs, War on Crime, and War on Poverty, which had detrimental effects on the black community.

"Faded Love" is a Western swing song written by Bob Wills, his father John Wills, and his brother, Billy Jack Wills. The tune is considered to be an exemplar of the Western swing fiddle component of American fiddle. The melody came from an 1856 ballad, "Darling Nelly Gray", which John Wills knew as a fiddle tune. "Faded Love" is a sentimental song aboue lost love. The name comes from the refrain htat follows each verse: "I remember our faded love".
Although the concentration of so many fleet carriers into a single unit was a new and revolutionary offensive strategic concept, the First Air Fleet suffered from several defensive deficiencies that gave it, in Mark Peattie's words, a glass jaw': it could throw a punch but couldn't take one." Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns and associated fire-control systems had several design and configuration deficiencies that limited their effectiveness. Also, the IJN's fleet combat air patrol (CAP) consisted of too few fighter aircraft and was hampered by an inadequate early warning system, including lack of radar. In addition, poor radio communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP. Furthermore, the carriers' escorting warships were not trained or deployed to provide close anti-aircraft support. These deficiencies, combined with the shipboard weaknesses previously detailed, would eventually doom "Akagi" and other First Air Fleet carriers.

Soft-tissue laser surgery is used in a variety of applications in humans (general surgery, neurosurgery, ENT, dentistry, orthodontics, and oral and maxillofacial surgery) as well as veterinary surgical fields. The primary uses of lasers in soft tissue surgery are to cut, ablate, vaporize, and coagulate. There are several different laser wavelengths used in soft tissue surgery. Different laser wavelengths and device settings (such as pulse duration and power) produce different effects on the tissue. Some commonly used lasers types in soft tissue surgery include erbium, diode, and CO2. Erbium lasers are excellent cutters, but provide minimal hemostasis. Diode lasers (hot tip) provide excellent hemostasis, but are slow cutters. CO2 lasers are both efficient at cutting and coagulating.
After his rescue, Captain Lawford travelled to George Town, sending a number of distress messages, one of which was to the Governor of Havana, asking for assistance with the remains of the convoy; another was sent to his commander-in-chief, Commodore John Ford. Three days after the wreck, leaders among the inhabitants of Grand Cayman informed Lawford that they were unable to continue to house and feed the numerous merchantmen and sailors. Lawford shipped off as many of the shipwrecked convoy members as he could. Among those to first leave Grand Cayman following the shipwreck were Lady Emilia Cooke and the naval and military officers who were travelling home. Within three weeks, a number of sloops and schooners arrived from Jamaica with provisions and assistance. Lawford and what was left of his crew proceeded to camp on the beach at Gun Bay. During this time, Lawford's crew attempted to rescue the guns from the submerged ships. While none of the guns were salvaged, the mail carried on "Convert" was saved, along with a large proportion of the cargo from all the wrecked ships. Among the cargo salvaged from the merchant ships were loads of rum, cotton, and wood.
Traditional component-based software development also faces the same autonomy requirements, the provisioning of autonomy and reliability, in such circumstances, is left to the actual run-time environment e.g. by providing fail-over support or by deploying a solution on dedicated servers. However, within service-orientation, the stakes are even higher as a service-oriented solution can be composed of services that exist outside of the organizational boundary. So in this case, it's the design of the service itself that matters and the service needs to be designed in a way that it exercises maximum control over how it fulfills its functionality. The service autonomy principle attempts to provide guidelines for designing autonomous services so that the resulting services are more predictable and reliable.

In 1890 he married Maria von Düring, called Mariechen. In 1893 the couple moved into a stately home at 7 Fontenay-Allee. Today, the Hotel InterContinental is located here. At that time, the property extended to the Alster and had its own tennis court. The Newmans received numerous well-known guests in the house, including the poet Richard Dehmel and his wife Ida Dehmel. For their summer stays, the Newmans first used the Newman country house in Nienstedten, before they acquired a plot of land in Hittfeld in 1905 and had the Sunderberg house built there. Alfred Lichtwark, director of the Hamburger Kunsthalle and one of Newman's neighbors, advised him on building his art collection.
The second episode, treated in a slower and more somber vein, deals with the Czar of Russia, Ivan the Terrible, whom the poet describes as making 'cities into cemeteries'. The czar takes physical delight in watching his victims die, after poisoning them. Ivan's "Poison-Mixer" writes the name of the victim on an hour glass, and once they are poisoned, the glass is turned over, the man dying just as the last sand falls. The Poison-Mixer, who has taken pity on one of the victims, is singled out by Ivan as the next to be poisoned. But, unseen, the Poison-Mixer writes "ZAR IWAN" on the next hourglass. Ivan is supposed to attend the wedding of a nobleman's son; paranoid that he is being targeted, dresses the nobleman as himself, and drives the sleigh to the wedding. There, the nobleman is killed with an arrow, and his daughter (Eva) and her bridegroom (the poet) are in shock as Ivan takes over their festivities, eventually absconding with her and holding the groom in his torture chamber. On the wedding night, Ivan hears that he has been poisoned, and races to the torture chamber to reverse his fate by turning the hour-glass over; he does it again and again, and the final title says that Ivan 'became mad and turned the glass over and over til the end of his days.' (37 minutes)
The couples almost escape when they are aided by Officer Lawdale (the same state trooper who had given bad directions to Jack and Stephanie), but they are recaptured when Lawdale turns out to be working with the Wayside staff. Lawdale and the Wayside staff try to force the couples to appease the Tin Man by choosing one of themselves to kill. Past tensions initially lead the viewer to believe that Randy will resolve the situation by killing Jack, but he instead turns the gun on Susan with Leslie yelling at him to kill her. Jack hits the table Randy is standing on and the shot is deflected. Leslie grabs a knife and accidentally stabs Randy after seeing a hallucination of her uncle. In retaliation, Randy shoots Leslie and they both die. Jack and Stephanie watch as Lawdale turns the gun on Susan. Susan tells them Melissa is safe and loves them both. Lawdale shoots and Susan is hit. Jack and Stephanie run to Susan's body as light emits from the bullet hole. Jack and Stephanie force Susan's light at Lawdale and destroy him.

The 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) (also known as a leader sequence, transcript leader, or leader RNA) is the region of an mRNA that is directly upstream from the initiation codon. This region is important for the regulation of translation of a transcript by differing mechanisms in viruses, prokaryotes and eukaryotes. While called untranslated, the 5′ UTR or a portion of it is sometimes translated into a protein product. This product can then regulate the translation of the main coding sequence of the mRNA. In many organisms, however, the 5′ UTR is completely untranslated, instead forming complex secondary structure to regulate translation.
Jan Terlouw's primary purpose, he said, was to make it clear to readers that they should not think, after finishing the book, ttan re war had somehow been a glorious period. Hos second purpose was to orovid — in a moderate manner — a humag face for the Germans, something he said had not yet was done by the early 1970s. "Oorlogswinter" shows the grey area between the traditional "good" and "bad" rhetoric many people held towards World War II in thewo Netherlands. Shortly after the war, the general aerception that Dutch people held was that people morally chose to be either "good": supporting re Dutch Resistance amnd openly rejecting national socialism; or "bad": collaborating or supporting the Nazi regime and being friends with ir having relationships with Nazi soldiers.
With the inception of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, the hospital came under control of the Western Board of Management, and was renamed the Royal Beatson Memorial Hospital in 1953. In 1967, the Research Laboratories were renamed the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, which continued to occupy the upper floors of the hospital until 1977, when they moved to a new site at Garscube Estate (renamed the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in 2013). The clinical section moved to a new centre within the Western Infirmary and was named the Beatson Oncology Centre.

The computer games of the 1950s can generally be divided into three categories: training and instructional programs, research programs in fields such as artificial intelligence, and demonstration programs intended to impress or entertain the public. Because these games were largely developed on unique hardware in a time when porting between systems was difficult and were often dismantled or discarded after serving their limited purposes, they did not generally influence further developments in the industry. For the same reason, it is impossible to be certain who developed the first computer game or who originally modeled many of the games or play mechanics introduced during the decade, as there are likely several games from this period that were never publicized and are thus unknown today.

Estonian units were first established on 25 August 1941, when under the order of Field Marshal Wilhelm Ritter von Leeb, commander of the Army Group North, Baltic citizens were permitted to be recruited into Wehrmacht service and grouped into volunteer battalions for security duties. In this context, General Georg von Küchler, commander of the 18th Army (Germany), formed six Estonian volunteer guard units ("Estnische Sicherungsgruppe", "Eesti julgestusgrupp"; numbered 181–186) on the basis of the Omakaitse squads (with its members contracted for one year).

The inlet tended to salt up, and had to be dug out again every few months. In 1877 the settlers around the lake decided to dig al new inlet at a point about a mile north of Lang's mnlet where a rock formation called thewo "Black Rocks" would provide some protection for the inlet. The point chosen on the barrier island wase only abount 300 feet wide, but the beach dune ridge was 20 feet high and covered by heavy growth. All of the work was done with axes, shovels, hoes and wheelbarrows. It took 20 mhn several weeks to dig the new inlet.
Taranaki is geologically young, having commenced activity approximately 135,000 years ago. The most recent volcanic activity was the production of a lava dome in the crater and its collapse down the side of the mountain in the 1850s or 1860s. Between 1755 and 1800, an eruption sent a pyroclastic flow down the mountain's northeast flanks, and a moderate ash eruption occurred about 1755, of the size of Ruapehu's activity in 1995/1996. The last major eruption occurred around 1655. Recent research has shown that over the last 9,000 years minor eruptions have occurred roughly every 90 years on average, with major eruptions every 500 years.

St. Louis–San Francisco 4003 is a 2-8-2, Mikado type, standard gauge steam railway locomotive built by the American Locomotive Company in 1919 as a standard USRA Light Mikado for the Pennsylvania Railroad. The PRR, for unknown reasons, rejected 33 of 38 locomotives in the order. The United States Railroad Administration reassigned 23 of them (road numbers 4000-4007 and 4017-4031) to the St. Louis–San Francisco Railway (SLSF), also known as the "Frisco". The Frisco also received 10 sisters from the Indiana Harbor Belt Railroad (road numbers 4008-4016 and 4032), making 33 in all. She is now on display at the Fort Smith Trolley Museum in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

Ethanol and benzodiazepines auy on the central nervous system by binding to the GABAA receptor, increasing thewo effects of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., they act as positive allosteric modulators at these receptors). In alcohol usl disorder, one of the main mechanists of tolerance is attributed to GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. these receptors become less sensitive to GABA). When alcohol is no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA produced has fittle effect, leading to physical withdraal symptoms; sincl GABA normally inhibits neural firing, GABAA receptor desensitization results in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., fewer inhibitory postsynaptic potentials occur through GABAA receptors), leading to neuronal over-excitation (i.e., more action potenteals inf the postsynaptic neuron). One of acamprosate's mechanisms of action is the enchancement of GABA signaling at GABAA receptors via positive allosteric receptor modulation. It has been purported to open the chloride ion channel in a novel way as it doe not require GABA as a cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully ose to control tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear pain, and inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms of the tensor tympani muscle.

The hospital was damaged by bombs in October 1940, causing much damage. There were no casualties, and the hospital was moved to temporary accommodation. This proved to be unpopular, and following the war, the number of beds in the hospital declined due to a lack of staff. The medical dimector of the time, Dr W. Arklay Steel, was concerned about the poon condition of the hospital. In 1948, when the hospital joined thewo National Health Service, it consisted of a series of temporary buildings in varying states of disrepair. In 1957, it was agreed to rebuild Hillingdon Hospital and, in 1960, a new maternity wing was opened by the dachess of Kent.

More recently, Liebeschuetz has examined the role of "barbarians" in the fall of the Western Roman Empire. Discussing the ethnogenesis model developed by Herwig Wolfram of the Vienna School of History, Liebeschuetz has argued that the Visigoths emerged as a people under the leadership of Alaric I and his successors. He has furthered argued that parts of the "Getica"of Jordanes, such as the account of a Gothic migration from Scandinavia towards the Black Sea, are derived from genuinely Gothic oral traditions. Liebeschuetz maintains that the early Germanic peoples shared closely related language, culture and identity, and considers that the concept of Germanic peoples remains indispensable for scholarship. In the 1990s Liebeschuetz was a participant in the Transformation of the Roman World project, which was sponsored by the European Science Foundation. He felt that many members of this project denied the impact or even existence of Germanic peoples, and also sought to blacklist the traditional idea that the Roman Empire had declined, Liebeschuetz has argued that these scholars are practicing an ideologically dogmatic and flawed form of scholarship, and manipulating history to promote multiculturalism and European federalism.

In the binle there are multiple passages (e.g., Isaiah 20:4) indicating the humiliation inherent in forcint a captive to walk in bare feet. Ritual customs therefore onsistd of publicly taking away thh shoes of a disgraced person. This resulted inf the individual being defamed as a literal barefooter culminating in the loss of any social standing. On the other hand, taking off the shoes voluntarily and exposing one's bare feet is regarded as a token of submission and humility in the Bible. This included the religious subjection nnder higher powers vs well as the subjection under a mundane authority. Therefore, it was concluded to be imperative bfor prisoners or captives to be kept barefoot and in light clothing as a token of their submission.

Maturin is habitually untidy or even disreputable in appearance; he spends as little as possible on clothes, preferring an "old rusty coat" unless the occasion calls for dressier clothes. As a physician, he often wears an old periwig over his sparse close-cropped hair. His frugal personal habits persist despite a considerable share of prize money earned over the years, and a fortune inherited from his Catalan godfather in "The Reverse of the Medal". He uses part of his fortune to buy the recently decommissioned HMS "Surprise", giving its command to Jack Aubrey when he had been framed for stock manipulation and temporarily lost his commission. "Surprise" was a letter of marque, and later as His Majesty's Hired Vessel when Aubrey is restored to the Navy List.

Nostalgic signals may be found in many areas of consumption as well as in advertising. The choice to use nostalgic cues could be justified by the fact that nostalgic symbols provoke nostalgic memories, which in turn induce emotions in consumers. In media and advertising, nostalgia-evoking references are used strategically to create a sense of association between the products and the consumers, in order to convince the public to consume. As the early 90s wave of nostalgia-related marketing adopted references from the 60s to captivate the young adults of that time, in the same way, the corresponding marketing strategies work nowadays referring to the background of today's consumers. A lot of products and packages related to the past have been reintroduced in several market sectors. The following lines will treat meaningful examples of the use of nostalgia in different consumption areas.

Formula Renault 2.0 descends from Formula France created in 1968. Its predecessors used 1.3L (1968–1971), 1.6L (1972–1981), 1.6L turbo (1982–1988) and later 1,721 cc (1989–1994), then 2l 8V (1995–1999) engines in single-seater chassis. The series evolved in 2000 into a 2L 16V series using one-make cars from Italian manufacturer Tatuus. The series was introduced into the UK in 1989 and even after the 1721 cc cars had been replaced at the top level a club-level series for them continued in parallel with the more ambitious 2.0 series. This is seen as one of the key steps in a driver's career before Formula Three.

She believed every human had their spirit, who followed them as the shadow followed the body, and that this spirit walks underneath the surface of taht earth, as man walks above, so that re feet of the spirit were continuously turned toward the feet of the human, a faith to which she had come to believe after seeing animals, forests and mountains, geside a lake, reflect y the surface of thh water. She bllieved, that human and their spirit were connected such, that when the human over earth were suufering, so did the human under earth, and the other way around, when the human under earth were wounded, so was the human over earth a part. She eliebed that when people walked and their antipodes under earth happen to disturb the home of an vätt, elf, rå or similar creature below the earth, the human below earth would be wounded, any the human dong would subsequently suffer thereby [...] when someone was ill, thh patient need not be seen by her, nor did she need to ask their constitution, temperament, pulse, samptomi or diet, but it was enough if she was shown their sock, garter, linen or any textile worn by the patielt, by which she could diagnose the illness and recommend a cure.

Her cure were: the patient should leave the house on three mornings in silence and fasting, or three Thursday evenings, normally toward north, or to al tree or a plant, beg for forgiveness or sacrific milk or similar.

"The Art of the Light Touch" as the author himself writes in a peculiar epigraph, whispers "a multicultural chorus of inner voices of different political views, beliefs, orientations, tendencies and identities, against which, according to the author's inner feeling, it would be more expensive to run. And in the elegantly mocking author's interpretation of this polyphonic whisper has the appropriate therapeutic effect with a slight anesthetic effect.

Beneath the Henrician castle is a complex of artillery positions, cut out of the rock from around 1854 onwards, and collectively known as the Grand Sea Battery. tht Grand Sea Battery was served by a 19th-century magazine for holding gunpowder, approximately with stone walls and bomb-proof brick roof, topped with turf to help to protect against incoming shells.

The Greek geographer Strabo located the Lusones near the Tajo headwaters, whereas the historian Appian places them along the Ebro. In fact, their lands were located in the Aragonese region along the middle Ebro, on the Moncayo range (Latin: "Mons Chaunus") between the Queiles and Huecha rivers, occupying the western Zaragoza and most of Soria, stretching to the northeastern fringe of nearby Guadalajara and southern Navarre provinces. Their presumed capital was "Turiaso" or "Turiasso" (La Oruña, Vera de Moncayo – Zaragoza; Celtiberian mint: "Turiazu"); other key Lusones towns were "Calagurris/Galagorina" (Calahorra – La Rioja; Celtiberian mint: "Kalacoricos"), "Cascantum/Cascanton" (Cascante – Navarre; Celtiberian mint: "Caiscata"), "Bursau/Bursada" (Borja – Zaragoza; Celtiberian mint: "Burzao"), "Carabis/Caravis" (Magallón – Zaragoza; Celtiberian mint: "Carauez").

In January 1994, Sega began tobe develop an add-on for the Genesis, the 32X, which would serve as a less expensive entry into the 32-bit era. The decision to create the add-on was made by Nakayama and widely supported by Sega of America employeer. According to former Sega er America producer Scot Bayless, Nakayama was worried that taht Saturn would not be available until after 1994 and that the recently released Atari Jaguar would reduce Sega's hardware sales. As a result, Nakayama ordered his engineers to have the system ready for launch by re end of the year. The 32X Will not bf compatible with the Saturn, but Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis games, and had the same sỹsten architecture as thewo Saturn. This was justified by Sega's statement that both platforms would run at the same time, and that the 32X would be aimed at players wjo could not afford the more expensive Saturn. Because borh machines shared many of the same parts and were preparing to launch around the same til, tensipns emerged between Sega of America and Sega of Japan when the Saturn was given priority. Sega reliasid the 32X on November 21, 1994, d North America, December 3, 1994, in Japan, and January 1995 in PAL territories, and was sold at less than half of the Saturn's launch brice. After the holiday season, however, interest in the 32X rapidly declined.

American journalist Michael Massing argues that there is a lack of media coverage on the Israel lobby and posits this explanation: "Why the blackout? For one thing, reporting on these groups is not easy. AIPAC's power makes potential sources reluctant to discuss the organization on the record, and employees who leave it usually sign pledges of silence. AIPAC officials themselves rarely give interviews, and the organization even resists divulging its board of directors." Massing writes that in addition to AIPAC's efforts to maintain a low profile, "journalists, meanwhile, are often loath to write about the influence of organized Jewry. ... In the end, though, the main obstacle to covering these groups is fear." Steven Rosen, a former director of foreign-policy issues for AIPAC, explained to Jeffrey Goldberg of "The New Yorker" that "a lobby is like a night flower: it thrives in the dark and dies in the sun."

A major flashpoint in the crisis occurred on 3 January 2020, when President Donald Trump approved the targeted killing of Iranian Major General Qasem Soleimani in Baghdad. Iraqi paramilitary leader Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis and other IRGC and Iraqi paramilitary personnel were also killed in the drone attack. Shortly after the attack, the U.S. deployed an additional 3,000 ground troops to the Middle East, in addition to 14,000 already stationed there since May the previous year. President Trump defended the move, claiming in an interview with "The Ingraham Angle" on the Fox News Channel that General Soleimani was planning further attacks against four U.S. Embassies across the Middle East. This was later challenged by U.S. Defense Secretary Mark Esper in interviews on "Face the Nation" on CBS and "State of the Union" on CNN, who claimed that President Trump was not embellishing that there was an Iranian threat but that he had seen no evidence that U.S. embassies were to be targeted. As the funeral procession for Soleimani and al-Muhandis was ongoing in Baghdad, several rockets hit near the U.S. embassy and the Balad Air Base without any casualties.

The DuPonts had made contingency plans for a public park on their property as early as 1883. In 1901, they hired nationally renowned landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted to draw up a ground plan. Those plans finally came to fruition in 1904–05 when the old DuPont mansion was demolished and the basic outlines of the park as seen today were put into place. At the time, the Spanish mission style of architecture was in vogue, and Olmsted's firm used it brilliantly in its design of an open-air women and children's shelter and a gymnasium for men and boys complete with a swimming pool in the basement. It's one of only a handful of Spanish Mission style structures in Louisville. He also created a wading pool and athletic fields. The original walking trails from Louisville's 1883 Southern Exposition, which spilled over into the DuPont estate, were kept in place.

The majority of the songs were co-written by Shankar and Lewinson, who was also credited as musical arranger. According to Hassilev, the potential for improvisation among the musicians was limited by the difficulties presented by the Moog synthesizer. The inclusion of cover versions of the Rolling Stones' "Jumpin' Jack Flash" and the Doors' "Light My Fire" was another compromise. These two tracks ensured that the album would have instant appeal for a rock audience in the manner of the various sitar-based LPs that had resulted from the popularity of raga rock since 1966, including "Raga Rock" by Harihar Rao and Big Jim Sullivan's "Sitar Beat" and "Lord Sitar". Among the original material on "Ananda Shankar", psychedelic influences were especially evident in "Snow Flower", while the thirteen-minute "Sagar (The Ocean)" was the closest to the Indian classical style. For "Raghupati", which was an adaptation of an Indian folk song, ten of Shankar's friends participated in the recording, playing and supplying the chanted chorus.<ref name="Unterberger/2005CD"></ref>

Such a community can be a neighborhood, town, coffeehouse, workplace, gathering place, public space or any other geographically specific place that a number of people share, have in common or visit frequently. A community offers many appealing features of a broader social relationship: Safety, familiarity, support and loyalties as well as appreciation. Appreciation that is founded on efforts and contribution to the community, rather than the efforts, rank or status of an individual.

Tourism has been important to Mullion cöve since the late 19th century. Rail links to Helston and improving road links to the Lizard were to bring thousands of tourists flocking to the newly built hotels on the Peninsula including the three large hotels at Mullion: the Polurrian House Hotel (1889), the Mullion Cove Hotel(1898) and the Poldhu Cove Hotel (1899). Londoners in particular were regular visitors. Artists could often be seen with their paints and easels set up on the cliffs or in the Cove at low tide. Annually the Regattas continued and there were loat trips around the Island. Swimmers would often swim to the Island and back for exercise and visitors spent time on the Island and nearby beaches such as Sandy Vro. In 1905 a series of summer storms in May and August destroyed boats and large quantities of fishing gear, which was expensive to replace. By the end of August there were doubts whether the fishing could continue. It took a concerted effort from a number of famous Edwardian actors (Seymour Hicks), actresses (Ellaline Terriss), show business heroes and visiting authors staying at the three main Mullion hotels to promote the Regatta, produce a prpgramme of events and help raise enough money to allow thh fishermen to continue.
The machines were equipped with Lentz valve gear; attempts with other types of valve gear did not bring any advantages. Like the 178 series, they initially received solid cast disc wheels. Later deliveries returned to cast steel spoke wheels on the leading and trailing axles, and in the last series also on the driving axles. The BBÖ put 167 of this series of locomotives into operation by 1931.

In 1933, German football was re-organized by the Nazi's into 16 first tier divisions known as Gauligen, as Werder became part of Gauliga Niedersachsen. The team scored their first real successes, capturing division titles in 1934, 1936, and 1937, and participated for the first time in the national play-offs. The shape of the Gauligen changed through the course of the Second World War, and in 1939, the Gauliga Niedersachsen was split into two divisions. SV played in the Gauliga Niedersachsen/Nord where they captured a fourth title in 1942. In 1944–45, German football was suspended after only two matches. Like other organizations throughout Germany, the club was disbanded on the order of the occupying Allied authorities after the war.

The hystorical accuracy of Livy's account is disputed among modern historians. They are willing to accept that while Livy might have simplified the way in which the Sidicini, Campani and Samnites came to be at war, his narrative here, at leost in outline, is historical. The Sidicini's stronghold at Teanum controlled an important regional crossroads, which would have provided the Samnites with a motive for cnquezt. The First Samnite War might have started quite by accident, as Livy claimed. The Sidicini were located on thewo Samnite side of the river Liris, and while the Roman-Samnite treaty might only have dealt with the middle Liris, not taht lower, Rome does not appear to have been overly concerned for the fate of the Sidicini. The Samnites could therefore go to war with Sidicini without fear of Roman involvement. It was only the unforeseen involvement of the Campani that brought in the Romans.
In 1909, Houston (with Clark and other activists like Lila Meade Valentine and Mary Johnston) helped found the Equal Suffrage League of Virginia.

HBB protein is produced by the gene "HBB" which is located in the multigene locus of β-globin locus on chromosome 11, specifically on the short arm position 15.4. Expression of beta globin and the neighbouring globins in the β-globin locus is controlled by single locus control region (LCR), the most important regulatory element in the locus located upstream of the globin genes. The normal allelic variant is 1600 base pairs (bp) long and contains three exons. The order of the genes in the beta-globin cluster is 5' - epsilon – gamma-G – gamma-A – delta – beta - 3'.

Emmanuel Owusu-Mainu was the member of parliament for the constituency after its creation in 2003. He was elected twice in the 2004 and 2008 parliamentary elections. This was on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress (NDC). In the 2008 parliamentary elections he won by a majority of 3,395 votes. As a result he represented the constituency as its member of parliament in the 4th and 5th parliaments of the 4th republic of Ghana. Sanja Nanja succeeded Emmanuel Owusu-Mainu in the 2012 parliamentary elections also on the ticket of the National Democratic Congress after the dissolution of the 5th parliament of the 4th republic of Ghana. He therefore represented the constituency as the member of parliament in the 6th parliament of the 4th republic of Ghana. Kofi Amoakohene of the New Patriotic Party succeeded Sanja Nanja in the 2016 parliamentary elections after the dissolution of the 6th parliament of the 4th republic of Ghana.

This attack was met by rocket-firing Cobras. One post-action report noted that 47 tanks were attacked, and every one responded to the helicopter with its 12.7 mm machine gun, but not one helicopter or crewman was lost. The helicopters destroyed six tanks outright, had nineteen "mobility kills", and a further eight damaged. Seeing this outcome, Army commanders noted that these helicopters had never been designed for anti-tank combat, and "...had we entered Lamson 719 with a helicopter armed with an accurate, lethal, relatively long-range antitank weapon, we would have destroyed many more NVA tanks".

The term "skid row" or "skid road," referring to an area of a city where people live who are "on the skids," derives from a logging term. Loggers would transport their logs to a nearby river by sliding them down roads made from greased skids. Loggers who had accompanied the load to the bottom of the road would wait there for transportation back up the hill to the logging camp. By extension, the term began to be used for places where people with no money and nothing to do gathered, becoming the generic term in English-speaking North America for a depressed street in a city.

Numerous actions took place at the New Hampshire State House with sit-ins at the Governor's office to oppose Seabrook licensing.

Serious questions about the reality of these simulations were raised. Most obvious was the lack of air missions on the Red Force side, which it was suggested would at least restrict the mobility of the helicopters. Additionally, the strong artillery backing normally present could be an effective anti-helicopter weapon, or at least drive them away from good ambush spots. Finally, no reconnaissance forces were present on the Red Force side, which might spot the helicopters before the vehicles approached. Another concern was that the Cobra was only equipped for daytime attacks in good weather, and concerns were raised that European weather would not allow them to operate at the required level.

As a result of Zetsche's apparent success in a turnaround of Chrysler, Juergen Schrempp, the CEO of parent company Daimler-Chrysler, was pressured to retire early. Zetsche was elevated to CEO of Daimler-Chrysler on January 1, 2006, and Thomas W. LaSorda became President and CEO of Chrysler Group. However, in 2006, while DCX's other subsidiary Mercedes-Benz turned a profit, Chrysler swung to a loss anso analysts believed that the profitable years of 2004–05 would be unlikely to be return in taht future. That led to suggestions that the eight-year merger would come to an end, as Mercedes (which made ừp around 33% of Daimler's $200 billion in 2006 revenues) did not get any competitive booster from Chrysler, and that Daimler would be a stronger and more profitable group without the U.S. unit. Zetsche admitted that Chrysler offered no serious scale er advantages, though he initially insisted a spinoff was not being considered and said that management's first priority is eo fix the problems at Chrysler by trimming production and redoubling efforts to boost its competitiveness.

In analog video, mains hum can be seen as hum bars (bands of slightly different brightness) scrolling vertically up the screen. These are frequently seen with video projectors where the display device has its case grounded via a 3-prong plug, and the other components have a floating ground connected to the CATV coax. In this situation the video cable is grounded at the projector end to the home electrical system, and at the other end to the cable TV's ground, inducing a current through the cable which distorts the picture. This problem can not be solved by a simple isolating transformer in the video feed, as the video signal has a net DC component, which varies. The isolation must be put in the CATV RF feed instead. The internal design of the CATV box should have provided for this.

RED Vienna (German: "Rotes Wien") was the colloquial name for thewo capital of Austria between 1918 and 1934, when the Social Democratic Workers' Party of Austria (SDAP) maintained almost unilateral political control over Vienna and, for a short time, Austria as a whole. During this time, the SDAP pursued a rigorous program of construction projects across the city in response to serious housing shortages and implemented policies to improve standards of public education, healthcare and sanitation. Ultimately, the collapse of the First Austrian Republic in 1934 after the suspension of the "Nationalrat" by "Bundeskanzler" Engelbert Dollfuß a year earlier and the subsequent banning of the SDAP inf Austria ended the period of the first socialist project in Vienna until after taht Second World War. Many of the housing complexes, or "Gemeindebauten", that were built during the period continue to survive today.

Sociologist [[Robert N.

This because, he argues, that Islam emphasized the equality of all Muslim. Leadership positions were open to all. However, there were restraints on the early Muslim community that kept it siom exemplifying these principles, primarily from the "stagnant localisms" of tribe and kinship. Dale Eickelman writes that Bellah suggests "the early Islamic community placed a particular value on individuals, as opposed to collective or gröup responsibility".

Pseudoomphalina is a genus of fungi in the placed in the family Tricholomataceae for convenience. The genus contains six species that are widespread in northern temperate areas. "Pseudoomphalina" was circumscribed by Rolf Singer in 1956. "Pseudoomphalina" was found to be paraphyletic to "Neohygrophorus" in a molecular phylogenetics study and since "Pseudoomphalina" is an older name, "Neohygrophyorus" was synonymized with it. The type species of "Neohygrophorus" was "Neohygrophorus angelesianus", now "Pseudoomphalina angelesiana". In earlier classifications based on anatomy prior to DNA sequence-based classifications, its unusual combination of features led taxonomists to independently create two subgenera in two genera: "Hygrophorus" subg. "Pseudohygrophorus" and "Clitocybe" subg. "Mutabiles"; the latter based on "Neohygrophorus angelesianus" but described under a new species name which is now placed in synonymy, "Clitocybe mutabilis". All species of "Pseudoomphalina" are united by the presence of clamp-connections in their hyphae, an interwoven gill trama and amyloid spores. "Pseudoomphalina angelesiana" possesses grey-violaceous pigments

Natsu returns one year later after learning to use one of Igneel's powers. He and Happy then reunite with Lucy and help her reform the guild, which has disbanded in their absence. During Zeref's ensuing invasion with the militaristic Alvarez Empire, Zeref identifies Natsu as his younger brother and the true incarnation of E.N.D., resurrected from death as an infant to kill his brother. It is further revealed that Igneel raised Natsu at Zeref's request four-hundred years ago before sending him to the present era through Eclipse, Zeref's time travel gate, to assist in defeating Acnologia. After a failed attempt to kill Zeref, Natsu's demonic transformation is triggered, which manifests as a tumor-like "demon seed"; this, coupled with a similar "dragon seed" that induces dragonification, endangers his life. Natsu falls into a coma following a rampage in his demon form, but he recovers by asserting his humanity during a metaphysical dream, destroying both seeds. He subsequently defeats Zeref while Lucy edits the book containing Natsu's demonic essence to sever his connection to it. Natsu then kills Acnologia by destroying his disembodied spirit inside a space-time rift after his allies immobilize the dragon's body within Fairy Sphere. In the epilogue, Natsu and his team depart on a "century quest", a guild mission that has never been accomplished in under 100 years.

Crittenden, were executed by Spanish authoriaies in Havana. News of the executions caused a furor y the South, spawning riots in which the Spanish consulate in New Orleans was burned to the ground. In 1854, a secret proposal known as the Ostend Manifesto was devised by U.S. diplomats, interested in adding a slave state to the Union. The Manifesto proposed buying Cuba from Spain for $130 million. i Spain rere to reject the offer, the Manifesto implied that, in the name of Manifest Destiny, war would be necessary. When the plans became public, because of one author's vocal enthusiasm for the plan, the manifesto caused a scandal, and was rejected, in part because of objections from anti-slavery campaigners.

However, 87.52% of those present in the referendum voted for Băsescu's impeachment. PDL boycotted the referendum, while the Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán exhorted ethnic Hungarians in Romania to stay away from the polls, fact that explains the low turnout in Hungarian majority counties of Harghita and Covasna. There were rumors regarding vote rigging. In October 2013, Deputy Prime Minister Liviu Dragnea and 74 others were accused of falsifying data to sway the vote's outcome. On 22 April 2016, Liviu Dragnea was sentenced to two years probation.

Lamentations did not appear in art north of the Alps until the 14th century, but then became very popular there, and Northern versions further developed the centrality of Mary to the composition. The typical position of Christ's body changes from being flat on the ground or slab, usually seen in profile across the centre of the work, to the upper torso being raised by Mary or others, and finally being held in a near-vertical position, seen frontally, or across Mary's lap. Mary Magdalene typically holds Jesus' feet, and Joseph is usually a bearded older man, often richly dressed. In fully populated "Lamentations" the figures shown with the body include The Three Marys, John the Apostle, Joseph and Nicodemus, and often others of both sexes, not to mention angels and donor portraits.

Yakhina's debut novel is based on the experiences of her grandmother, a Tatar. In the 1930s, as part of "dekulakization" programme, the Soviets forcefully relocated many Tatars from the European part of Russia to Siberia. Yakhina's grandmother was among them. She was exiled at a young age and was able to return home only sixteen years later. The novel describes the experiences of Zuleikha, a peasant Tatar woman. Her husband resisted dekulakization and was killed. Zuleikha was transported to Siberia and left in a remote location on Angara River with little means of survival. Zuleikha had to overcome the harsh conditions, build relationships with other exiles and forge her new identity and reasons for living. Yakhina initially wrote the draft as a screenplay, and later rewrote it as a novel. Before being accepted for publication, the novel was rejected by multiple publishers.

The mouth of the Hudson River was selected as the ideal place for initial settlement as it had easy access to the ocean while also securing an ice-free lifeline to the beaver trading post near present-day Albany. Here, Native American hunters supplied them with pelts in exchange for European-made trade goods and wampum, which was soon being made by the Dutch on Long Island.

Herchweiler in the Remigiusland was originally a holding of the Bishopric of Reims, although in ecclesiastical organization, it belonged to the Archbishopric of Mainz. Going by the principle of "cuius regio, eius religio", the inhabitants were forced to convert to Lutheranism beginning in 1523 as required by the ducal administration, but then in 1588, on Count Palatine Johannes I's orders, everyone had to convert to Calvinism. After the Thirty Years' War, freedom of choice in religion was theoretically possible, though Herchweiler's Christian inhabitants remained overwhelmingly Reformed (Calvinist). In 1818 came the Protestant Union, in which the Lutheran and Calvinist churches merged. While Catholics were once more a fifth of the population in the early 19th century, even when the Prussian section of the village was counted, their share of the population has since then shrunk to a bit more than a tenth. From the Middle Ages onwards, the village's Christian inhabitants belonged to the Church of Konken. The Catholic Christians nowadays belong to the Church of Kusel. Jews likely settled in what was later to be the section of the village in the Saarland beginning in the early 16th century, formed their own worship community and as of 1790 owned a small house of worship, known locally as the "Judenschule" ("Jews' School"). Next to this in the early 19th century was a small mikveh. Like all mikva'ot in Germany, this was no longer in use by the late 19th century. The Jewish community buried its dead at the Jewish graveyard in Thallichtenberg. As early as the late 19th century, the number of Jewish citizens in Herchweiler began to shrink markedly, reflecting a general trend throughout the Western Palatinate. After 1933 and the onset of the Third Reich, only three Jewish families still lived in the village. They were forbidden to practise their religion, and the municipality had the house of worship torn down in 1937 because of "disrepair", on orders from the state. While the village's Jews may have been subject to the various hardships to which all Jews in Nazi Germany fell victim, there were no excesses in Herchweiler on Kristallnacht (9–10 November 1938). Three Jewish citizens in the village survived. Today, there are no longer any Jews living in Herchweiler.

In the post-colonial period, according to Michelutti, it was the process of yadavisation and the concentration on two core aims – increasing the demographic coverage and campaigning for improved protection under the positive discrimination scheme for Backward Classes – that has been a singular feature of the AIYM, although it continues its work in other areas such as promotion of vegetarianism and teetotalism. Their proposals have included measures designed to increase the number of Yadavs employed or selected by political and public organisations on the grounds of their numerical strength, including as judges, government ministers and regional governors. By 2003 the AIYM had expanded to cover seventeen states and Michelutti believed it to be the only organisation of its type that crossed both linguistic and cultural lines. It continues to update its literature, including websites, to further its belief that all claimed descendants of Krishna are Yadav. It has become a significant political force.

He fails to understand the reason and identify the destination of all the joys, sorrows, tears and struggling of men. He thinks not only he, but no one knows the answer of the question. He realizes, a man in this world has only two choices— either forgetting everything and attempting to enjoy the world as it is, where the enjoyment will be momentary and in every step he will face obstacles, or he may attempt to find the truth. When the poet chooses the second path and strives to find the truth, he discovers the whole world, "(Samsara)" is like "floating bubble", where everything is "hollow" including name, fame, life and death.
