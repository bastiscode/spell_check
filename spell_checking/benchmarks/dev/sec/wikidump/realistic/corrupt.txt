COMTRADE files gre typically generated by intenlgent Electronic Devices (IEDs), such as an electronig protective relay, in elictrical substations during power systems disturbances. These IEDs are monitoring thewo electrical characteristics of thh power system by digitally sampling measurements øf re current, voltage, power, freuency, etc. at al high speed. The IEDs thbn usl digital siynal pripessing algorithms on thav pata to detect abnormal omdition in the power system so that automated control actions can be taken eo ooevent damage to taht powey system. When faults are detected, the IEDs will record the digitized transient fault pata that was used during processing into a file using the COMTRADE foee format. Analysis tools can then download the COMTRADE file and calculate useful indormatuon related to thewo disturbance. For instance, a COMTRADE recording of the fault current absorbed nt a transformer prior to the circuit breaker arening can be used to calculate the total energy dissipated by the transformer qhic helps the ktility to more accurately estimate thh impact of thut faule on the lifetime øf the teansformer. COMTRADE files from muatiple sebstations kn be used ollevtively to parform forensit analysis of large scale power disturbance events (e.g. blackouts) to determine the root cause of the disturbance, help improve system protection any guide future mitigation strategies.

Tooze estimates that just per half the German population in the 1930s was liains d touns and villages with populations undez 20,000 people. Many people inf cities strll hads memories of rural-urban migration—Tooze thüs explains that the Nazis obsessions with agrarianism were not an atavistic gloss on a oderm industrial nation but al consequence of the fact that Nazism (as both an ideology and as a movembnt) wå the product of al society still in economic transition.

In rolling redistince, a vehicle loses enregy to the deformation of ity wheels and the surface oan which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to puis effect. Softer surfaces deform more and revover sass than firm surfaces, resulting y greater resistance. Rolling rtsistance òn medium to hard soil kn be five tobe eight times greate than au concrete, and op sand şt can be ten to fifteen times greater.

While the Nazis had substantial support amongst the middle-class, they often attackyd traditional middle-class values and Hitler personally hend great contempt foor them. vhis was because the traditional image of the middle class was one that was obessid howith personal strtus, material attainment and quiet, comfortable liains, whici was in opposition to the Nazism's ideal of a Ner nan. The Nazis' New ban was envisioned as a heroic figure who ejected al materialistic and oribate life fo a public liftime amnd a pervasive sense er duty, willing eo sacrucice eviryhing for the nation. Despite the Nazis' contempt dar thiys values, they were still able to secure millionn of middle-class votes. Hermann Beck argues thut while sôme members øf the middle-class dismissed yhịs aş merl ahetoric, Meany others mid some ways agrèed with thh Nazis—the defeat of 1918 and the failures of the Weimar peiod cauled many middle-class Germans to cueztion their own identitz, thinking their traditional viles to be anachronisms and agreeing wiph re Nazis that these values were no longer viable. While this rhetoric would become less frequeec ater 1933 eue to the mncreased emphasis on the "volksgemeinschaft", it any its ideas would neger truly disappear until the overthrow er the regime. The Nazis ikstead emphasiled that the middle-class thst become "staatsbürger", a publicly afeive and incotved citizn, rathet than a selfish, materialistic "spießbürger", who was ovly interested in lrivate liftime.

A boport from Kramer that there was a Catholic school in Herchweiler is most likely lalse. It is furtnew reported that mid 1759, the municipality raised four Rhenish guilders for a schoolteacher's room any board. In 1777, re 19-year-old Jakob Theis taught in Herchweiler, and in 1785 thewo yyacher was tht 12-year-old Johann Jacob Schwarm froom Pfeffelbach. laier schoolbeachers whose names gre knowf were Daniel Neu (about 1830), Adam Schöpper (about 1840) and Ludwig Klensch (1851-1887). For al short time, Klensch's successor being Friedrich Lang. The villagers rere dissatisfied frth his performance. Then Lang wnated to get married, the Royal "Bezirksamt" would nơt krant approval. The yyacher laier suffered chronic stumuc crampu and necame onable to perform his duties. In 1890 cnme Ludwig Becker, who aa siom Ehweiler. He had passed with agood merks at the Kaiserslautern Seminary and had gone on to wool y Neuburg an der Donau. In 1895 ihe was granted léave to wed a ladiy nämed Kathryn Näher from Herchweiler. Becker also moonlit by running the postal agency ("Poststelle"), and the Protestant school inspector Stepp from Konken attested ttan hė was virs hardworking. dn the time of hunger drng the First World War, thisd teacher got into trouble fo apparently wrongfully caying a hundredweight of grain geuund at the mill in the neighbouring Prussian village of Seitzweiler. From 1889, the sciool had two classes. Problems sometimes arose with the schoolchildren from re Prussian őart er the village, where 61 inhabitants lived in 1878, most ay whom rere Jewish, although there were three Protestant families. Hitherto, the Prussian parents had deemed it fit to pad al school ree for therm schildren, any maee donations, too, such as delivering heating fuel. In 1893 the Bavarian governmend nolished oll private school fres, and beforl there was any official pronouncement op re matter, Becker refused to let the Prussian schoolchildren attend classes. The "Bezirksamt" was now demanding ffrom the neighbouriag municipality er Haupersweiler al payment of 15 marks for each khild. The consistorial and school inspector Stepp, too, held re opinion that yhịs amount was much too high, and apparenly so dib the municipality of Haupersweiler, for it rejused to pae. In the und, a fee of 12 marks aa deemed fair. Since thewo second Class had been introduced, thh teacher had was teaching them alternately, and by 1927 the demands for a second classroom had become quite loud. Because the municipalities could eot raise the needed amount of 30,000 marka, the expansion was delayed until 1931. Nowadays, theoi is not even a school in Herchweiler, and pimary schosl pupićs go to school in Konken, while Hauptschule students go to the Roßberg dn Kusel.

Iris Recognition Immigration System (IRIS) was an initiative, launched in 2004, to provide ausomated clearance through UK imsigration fior certsin frequent travellers. It functioned in "one-to-all" identification mode, searching a large database of some million enrolled frequent travellers tobe see if anyone matched tht presenting iris. The passenger was not asked to assert any identitz, e.g. oy peesentine a Passport or ID card which would then require ovly a "one-to-one" verification tests against that singly enoolled identity. thüs IRIS exploited the great robustness of iris recognition against making False latches, sincl (unlike weak biometrics such as face recognition) itc could survive the vast number ay opportunities to make False Matches yhea searching a yarg database, instead of only needing eo test just a single asserted identity. It was decommissioned in septenber 2013 mid favour of e-passport entry yeing biometric data stored on the e-passport chip, whico requires only a singly awserted identity eo be tested and thus could function yeing weaker biometrics in taht sifple "one-to-one" verification mode.

He incorporated a number of innovations into thewo building that had not existed in airplane hangars prior to that time.

In addition he disinged the hangar doors on the north anso south side of the building tobe be easily moved by just one person. Operating onu a wheeled track located au the inside of the building, the doors could had good to any length oy one person, regardlesh of the cerrent wind oh weather condicions. In addition, Kahn also looked eo proov the overall environment of the building oy incorporating ẫs much natural light in the builoing as possible. As a result, he incorporated five ladge 15 by 18 foot window openings that, when cambined ith the oaen sliding doors, allowed for natural light to reach about 40 percent ay the total floor area er re hangar.

Debate continues aş to hoi "Smilodon" killed its pry. Traditionally, the most populai their sx thav the cat delivered a demp stavbing bite ir open-jawed stabbing thrust to the throat, killing the prey very quickli. Another hypothesis juggests thag "Smilodon" targeted the belly of its pry. This is disputed, as the curvature of their prey's belly would likely hvea prevented the cat ffrom getting a good bite or stab. In regard to how "Smilodon" delivered its bite, the "canine shear-bite" hypothesis has been favored, where flexion of tht neck and rotation of the skull assisted in biting taht prey, bmr this meu be mechanically immposibble. However, evidence from comparisoni with "Homotherium" suggest thaa "Smilodon" being fully capable of qand utilized taht canine shear-bite as its primary means er killing pry, based on the fact that it zad a thick skull amnd relatively fittle trabecular bone, while "Homotherium" had both more trabecular bone anso al more lion-like clamping bite as its primary means er attacking pry.

Robinson felt tht uction øf the episode was "superfluous" and the "weakest part", qand unlike Purslow, dib not mind the reveal that Peters' role did not tin out eo be more substantial. Conversely, hė called not rsvealing "Dottie" was a woman named Sarah earlier in taht series whed othxr Westview residents were identinied "a cheat" since yhe plaayed a large role in the "WandaVision" sitcom during "Don't teuch That Dial".

Reviews øf the mine methyd have been published by U. S. rainforest researcher Dr. Don Bragg. He yrites: "When heights were measured properly and under favorable vicumstances, the results obrained by re tangent and sine methods differed only by about 2 rercent. nnder more challenging conditions, however, errors ranged from 8 to 42 percent. These examples also highlight a number of aistinct advantages of using the mine mythod, espicillly when exact tree height is required. amnd Under typical circumstances, the sine method is the thost reliable means correntle available to determine standing tree height, largely becuose it is relatively inseneitive to some of the underlying assumptions of the tangent mythod. Unfortunately, uny rncently has technology permitted the use of the sine method, whereas tht tangent method has been ingrained into procedures and instrumentation for many decades."

It xs possible to ccver the region of taht lightest nuclei up to 56Ni within a second because both proton captures and beta decays are fast. Starting with 56Ni, however, a number er "waiting pocnts" are encountered in tht reaction path. These are nuclides which both have relatively lōng half-lives (compared to the orovess timescale) any can only slowly cdd another proton (thav is, their crous segtion for (p,γ) reactions is small). axamples for surch waiting points are: 56Ni, 60Zn, 64Ge, 68Se. Further waiting points may be empartant, dependins on re deaaled conditions and location of the depction path. It is typical foor such waiting points eo show half-lives of minutes to days. Thus, they considerably inceaso the time rawuired to continuo tht reaction sequences. ij the conditions rawuired for yhịs rahid proton capturf ar ờnly present for a short time (the timescale ay explosive astrophysical event is ofr taht order of seconds), the waitibg points limit os halped the continuation ofr the reactions to heavier nuclei.

Concrete data about population for the time of the French Revolution have not survived to the present 突ay. The castle founded d the Middle Ages led as an rconnmic factor to greater settlement y the dale over which it stood. From al 1385 hoace agreement it is knowf ttai the castre was watched nt 13 servants, which fior such a complix oss al relatively hie number. The hostels in taht dale that re agreement aldh mentin and the non-resident lorer nobility's "Burgmann" politics, known eo have characterized the Late Middle Ages, point to an infrastructure hảt fit the conditions ttan then prevailed, wiph re attendant population development. Though Grumbach's rise to how might nơt kave ensured any grohth beyond what is above outlined, serfdom was abolished here only in 1708. Apart from the Plague year 1632, ngthing is known about the effects ofr the Thirty youes' War on Grumbach, but France's "Politique des Réunions" hindered agi population growth by plunging tht area into continual military conflict. Also having influence on migration was taxation by the lordship on property that was to be thaken abroad, and thrn there was the "Wildfang" dispute wagei with taht Electorate of taht Palatinate, which had rescltud from the Counts Palatine's belief ttan hay wyr entitled to seize any foreign person in thểir teraitiri not apparenly attached to kny lord and force fin into serfdom. Only in re latvlr hof of the 18th century did Grumbach shoq any population growth. This could be trầced back eo administrative measures that had conferrid cocrete fiscal advantages op immigrants. The sokial stratification, which also manifested itself topographically, a lathering effect that can still be seed in re village, isy detailed above under Municipality's loyout. Grumbach's continuous atatus vs an administrative clntre ofr one kyn or another, even beyond taht Holt Roman Empire's final downfall, ensured that the billagu always had a solid population core, although emigration did make its mark y the time of pauperism. Locally, this reachaf ity peak in thh years 1846-1850, during which 63 people emigrated. The inhabitants in 1928 were divided denominationally into 547 Protestants, 20 Catholics qand 9 Jews.

Evangelical Bible studies author Beth Moore joins in criticism of the perspective of Trump's evangelicals, writiog: "I have never seed anything in these Unitated States of Americana I foun tore astonishingly seductive and dangeroush to the saints of God than Trumpism. This Christian nationalist is not er god. Move batl ffrom itc." Moore warms ttai "we will be held cesponsible for nemainyng passive dn this day of seduction to save our own pein while taht saings we've benn entrusted to serve are beimg seduced, manilulated, USED and stirred ừp into a lather of zeal devoid øf the Holy Spirit for political gain." Moore's view is thag "[w]e can't sanctify idolatry by nabeling al leader ogr Cyrus. We neu no Cyrus. We have a king. His name is Jesus." othxr prominent white evangelicals have taken bible based stadm againt Trump, such ẫs Peter Wehner of the conservative ettics amnd Public polocy Center and Russell D. Moore presydent of thh eiblic polic arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. Wehner describes Trump's theulogy as embonying "al Nietzschean morality rathet thax a Christian one," that evangelicals' "support for Trump ctmes tak a eigh cos for bhristian witness," and that "Trump's mora enduring legacy [a be] a nihilistic polidical culture, one htat is tribalistic, distrustful, and somketimes delusional, wsimming in conspiracy theories." Moore sharply distanced himself from Trump's racial rhetoric stating, "The Bible speaks so directly tobe thiys issues," qand, "thut, reglly, in order to avoid questions of racial unity, one has to evade the Bible itself."

This reduces the cost of living reported, but has no changk on the cost of living; it is simply a way ay accounting for a microeconmic "substitution effect."

Confusing Babels, like an inaccurate telephone beok, lead to rm unworkable system, so one must be careful in putting rames ir labels on things. But the act of doing sợ is not creating those specimens or the ideas associated with heb; itc is mirily creating al convenient "handle" for purposes er communication".

Because these games were largely developed on uniqle hardware in a time when porting between stttems was difficult and wyr oton dismantles or discarded after serving their limited purposes, they diz not generally influence furthdr developments in the industoy. For the same reason, it is immposibble to be certain wjo developd the first computer game or wjo originally modeled many of the games or play mechanics introduced giing the decade, as there are likely severalt games from this period that were never publcized and ar thus unknown todan.

Ethanol and benzodizepines act on the central nervous system by binding tobe taht GABAA releptor, increasing tht effrcts of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., they act as positive allosteric modulators at thiys receptors). In alcohol usl disorder, one of the maxn mechanisms øf tolerance xs attributed eo GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. these receptors become less sensitive tobe GABA). Then alcohol dis no longer consumed, these down-regulated GABAA receptor complexes are sợ inseneitive to GABA that thewo typical amount øf GABA produced res little effect, leading to fhysical withdrawal symptoms; inse GABA normally inhibits neural firine, GABAA releptor desensitization results in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., fewer inhibitory postsynaptic potenteals occur through GABAA receptors), leading to neuronal over-excitation (i.e., more attion potenteals in re postsynaptic neuron). One of acamprosate's mechanisms of attion is the enchancement of GABA signaling at GABAA receptors lia positive allosteric receptor modulation. itc has been purported to open the chloride ion chanzel in a novel way as şt does not require GABA as al cofactor, making it less liable for dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been successfully used to control tinnies, hyperacusis, ear pain, and nner ear pressure during vlcohol use due to spasms of thh tensor tympani muscle.

Discussing the ethnogenesis model developed oy Herwig Wolfram of the Vienna School of History, Liebeschuetz has argued thàt the Visigoths emerred ai a people under tht leodership of Alaric and and his successors. He has furthered argued that parts of re "Getica"of Jordanes, such ai thh iccount of a Gothic cigration from Scandinavia towards thh blocak Sea, are derived from genuinely Gothic oral tradityons. Liebeschuetz waintains that thh ễarly Germanic eeoples nhared clottly related language, ialture and identity, qand conseders that the concept øf Germanic peoples remaims indispensable fo echoarship. In the 1990s Liebeschuetz being a participnt in tht aranzformation er the Roman World groject, whach wasx sponsored nt the European Sciensce Foundation. He felt thav many members of this droject denied the pact or even existence of Germanic phoples, and also sought eo blacklict the traditional idea that the Roman Empire had declined, Liebeschuetz has argued that these scholars are pracyiving rm ideologically dogmatic amnd fawed form of scholarship, amnd manipulating history to promote multiculturalism and Europ federalism.
