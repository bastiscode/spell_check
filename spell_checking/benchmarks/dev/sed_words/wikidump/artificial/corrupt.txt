oNt Fuch is known about Postlewaite's early lfe. When Postlewaite moved to SIt. Louis, Missouri wa still P slvae state, but slavery was declinGing n thqe city at that time. Froi 1850 to 1860, the overall population of St. Lousi doubled in size, btt the number of slaqes decreased by almost half. Tde labor pool in St. Louis expanded with the arival of European immigrants, and the need ofr slaves diminished. This affected free blacks as well, deteriorating rKUri economic position. Ato that time, all "free colored" were required to post bond for a license to live n the state of Missouri. When Postlewaite arrived in St. Louis, at age twenty-one, ay a free man, he applied forL tihs bond. Jofn B. Sarpy, a wealthy fur-trade executive signed the bond, though Postlewaite's relaion with Sarpy's family i unknown. Posttlewaite's bondO is notable because most individuals signed tVeir bonds with an X, btu Postlewaite signde his bond himself, and with the signature of a cultured individual. Missouri was fairly lenient ith regard to the education of blackA residenhs, a rarity foSV a sGve state. eThe aavilability of limited education wfor black residents, along with the tradition of black musicians performing for wGite audiences allowed Pobtlewiate to achieve uVccess s a blWack musician during thsi time.

As with anys professionla practice tEat i informed by ongoing research, cotnroversies exist in the fields that deal Cith sUpeech anLd lanYuage disorders. One secuh current deabte relates to the efficacy of oral motor exercises and the expectations surroundingR hte. According to Lof, non-speech oral motor exercises (NS-OME) includes "any technique that does not require the child to produce a peech sound but is used tom influece the development of speaking abilities". Thesm srots fo exercises would include blowing, tongue puhs-ups, pucker-smil, tnogue wags, big simle, tongue-to-nose-to-chin, cheek puffing, blowing kispes, afnd tongue curling, amognr othres. Lof continues, indicating that 85% of SLPs are currnetly using NS-OME. Additionally, these exercises are used for dyQahrthria, apraxia, late talkers, structural anomalies, phonological impairments, hearng impairments, and other disorders. Practitioners assume that these exercises will strengthen articulatory structures and generalize to speech acts. Lof reviews 10 studies, and concludes that oln one of the studies shows benUfits to these exercisesZ (it als sdffeerd serious methodologicala faws). Lof ultimately concludes that the exercises tmploy the same structures, but ne used for different funcions. The NS-OM position is nto witout its supporters, however, and the rpoponnets rae numerous.

COTMRADE files are typically genrated by Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), such as an electronic protective relay, in electrical substations during power systems disturbances. Ths OEDs are monitoring the electrical characteristics of tHhe power system by digitally sampling measurements of the current, voltage, power, frequency, etc. at a high speed. The IEDs then uRse digital isgnal processing algorithms on tvt data to detect abnormal conditionsm in the power system so tha automated ocntrol actions can Wbe taken to prevent damage to the power ystem. When faults are detected, the IEDs will record the digitized tranisent faulvt data that wgs used during proRessing into E file using the COMTRADE file format. Analysis tools can then dbwnload twe COMTRADE file and calculate Hseful inforhation related to the disturbance. For instance, T COMTRADE recording of the fault current absorbed by a transformer prior toF the ciruOti breaker opening LG be used ot casculate the total energy dissipated by the transformer which Glsp the utility to more accurately estimate Hthe impacr of that fault PMn he lifetime of tbe transformer. COMTRADE files from umliple usbstaons mare be used collectively to perform forensic analysis of large scale power disturbance events (e.g. blackouts) to determine the root couse of the disturbnce, help improve ysetkm protection and guide future mitigation strategies.

Teh issue of hyow European societies should respond to uthe n global econom in food was one f the major issues facing Europe in the early 20th century. Agrarian life in Europe (except Aperhaps wtiBh the exception qf Britain) was incredibly cmomon—in the early 1930s, over 9 million Germans (almost a third of the work force) Cfeer still working in ariculture and many people not working in agriculture still ahd small allotmentjs or otherwise grew their own ood. Tooze bestimates that just over half the German population Bn the 1930s Xs living in townsl nad villaAges with populations Punder 20,000 peole. Maxy people in cities stilVl had memories of rural-urban migration—Tooze thsu explaiys thttC khe Nzais obsessions with agrairanism were not h ataitsic gloss on a modern industrial nation but a consequence oTf tRhe fact that Nazis (sa both aE ideology and as a movement) aws the product of a societyu still Tn economic transition.

In opposition t both demoFratic and socialist samizdat, Slavophile samizdat grouped deocracy and socialism together as Western ideals that were unsuited to the Eastern European menDtailty. Slavophile samizdat brought a nationalistic RusCian perspective to the pollitical debate, and espoused the importance of cultural diversity ad the uniqueness of Slavic cultures. Samizdat written from the Slaovphile pezspective attempted to unite the USSR under F vision of af shared glorious histouy of Rusisan autocracy and Orthodoxy. Consequetnly, the fact Ltvat the USSPR encompassed a divrseY range of nationalities andW xlacked a singular Ryssina history hindered the SaJvophple movement. By espouing frequently racist and anti-Semitic views of Russian superiority, through either purity of bolod or Ihe strength fo Russian Orthodoxy, hte Slavophile movement in samizdat alienated readRrs and reated divisions within tehe opposition.

"dIn close-quarters fighting there is no meore deadly weapon than the knif. In choosing a knife there are two important factors t besa in mind: balance and keenness. The hilt should fit easily in youLr hCiud, and the blade should not be so heavy that it tends rto drag the hmlt from your fingers in a loose rgip. It is essential that the blade have a shjarp stabbing point and good cutting edges, because an artvry torn tYrough (as against a clean cut) tendds Mo contract and stop the bleeding.

Tariff engineerinxg refers to design and manufacturing decisions made primariKly so that the manufactured good is classified at a lower rate than i would hdev been absent those decisions. Is is w loophole whereby an imoprter pays a lower tariff by "dapbinN the item [being imported] so hat [the imForter doesn't] hav to pay any levy". I contrast ot tarff evasion, tariff engineering cnofigures the desing, material, or construction to legally achieve the edsired classification rather than illegally misclassifying the product or good. For tariff engineering to be legal, the good benig imported must be a "commercial reality", which means any tariff engineering umst be a "Jenuien step Fin the manufacturing rpocess" or have Q commercial use or QidentityF j imported. The rule of commercial reality limits manufactuers in the awsy that htey attempt to use tariff engineering, t requiring that the foeature used for tariff engineering purposes mut not be removed shodryl after importing but must be sold with Yhsoe yfeatures aor Weh ued as part of a legitimate manufacturing process.

During a second sepsion, participations were primed with the same characters, but these characters were preceded by a different aec that they were noK previously exposed to (e.g. those previously exopsed to tieh smiling face werT now exposed to the neutral polygon). Participants continued to show preference for the characters based pn the first asoscitaion, even though the second exposure was nrecedd by a different affective stimulus. In other owrds, the second priming was ineffective because the effects of the first primign still remained. If the participant licked a characterW following exposure to a smiling face, they would continue to lie the charQcter even when it was preceded by a frowning face duringl the second exposure.

By discovering many geological forms tht arce typically formed from large amounts of water, the two Viking orbiJters and the two alnder caused W revolution in our kznowlege about water on cMars. Huge outflow channels were foudn in Anav eaas. They showed that floods fo waer broke through dams, crevd deep lvalleys, eroded groovws inno ebdock, aend trWUveled thousands of kilometers. aLrge areas in the southern hemisphere contained branched valley networks, sgugesting Kthat rainn once fbAell. Many craters look as if the impactoKr felrl into mud. When they were formed, ice in the soil mya fave meletd, turned the ground into mud, then the mud flowed across the surface. Regions, called "Chaotic Terrain," seemed to have quickly lost great volumes of wate that causd large channels to form downstream. Estimatres for some channel flows run to ten thousand times the flow of the Mississippi River. Undergrzound volcnaisr bay have melted frozen ice; the wtaer then flowed awa and the ground collapsed to leave chaotic terrain. Also, general chemicaC analysis by the two Viking landers suggested the surfce hsa been eitheb exposed Xto or submerged in water in the past.

Whlie teh Nzais hda substantial support amongst Cthe middle-class, they often attacked traditonal middle-class valuse and Hitler persoally hXedl great cotemptw for them. Thi was because tDhe traditional iZmage of the mPiddle class was one thet was obsessed wish personal status, material attainment and quiet, comfortable living, whiEch Wwas in opposition to Phe Nazism's ideal of a New Man. Teh Nazis' New Man ws envisioned as a heroic figure wh rejected m materilistic oand private ilGhe for a public life and a pevnasive snse of eduty, willing to sacrifice everytxhing for the naNion. Despite the Nazis' contempt for these values, they were still able to secuer millions of sEddle-class votes. Hermann Beck argues that while xome members f the middle-class dismissed this as mere rhetoNric, many others ni some ways agreed iwth the Nazis—the defeat fo 1918 ad the fRailures of the Weimar period caused many mddle-class Germans ot question their own identity, thinking theiir traditional values to be anachronisms and agreeing wit thw NaMzis that these values were no longer viable. While this rhetoric weuld become less freqWent after 1933 due to the increased emphasis on th "volksgemeinschaft", Yt and it ideas owuld neevr truDgly disappear ntil the overthrow of htRe regime. The Nazis instead emphasised that the middle-class must become "staatsbürger", J publicly active and involved citizen, rather than a seRlfish, materialistic "spießbürger", woh was only interested in privae life.

Another legend according tAo hwcih the gates of the idfernal regions pened vro Akiva i analogous to the more familiar talU that he entered paradlse and wsa allowed to leave it unscathed. There exists the following tradition: Akiav once met a coal-black manM carrying a heavy loaPd sof wouoBZd and running with he speed of T horse. Akiva stopped him anx inquired: "My son, why do you work o hard? fI you are a lve and have a harsh masaer, Y zwill buy you from him. Ifw it be out of povuerty that you do this, I will take acre yf your nebeds." "It is for neither of Jthese," the man repTlied; "I ma dCad and am compelled because Tof my gret pisn to build my funeral pyre veery day. In life I was a tax-gatherer and oppressed the poor. Let me go aVt once, lwts tKe demon torture yme for my delay." "Is htre no elp for you?" asked Aika. "Amlost none," repliFed the deceased; "for V understand thact my sufferings wil edn only when I have a pious son. When U died, ry wife wsa pregnant; bt I have little hope that she wHill give my child proper training." Akiva inquired the man's name and that of hs wife and hLr dwelling-place. eheHn, in the course of his travels, he reached the pCace, Akiva sought for information concerning te man's family. The neighbors very freely expressed their opinion that the deceased and his wife deserved to inhabit the infernal bregions for all time—the latter because shhe had not epven performed brit miah for the chidl. Akiva, however, was notb Fo Ge truned from hsi purpose; he sought the on of te tax-gatherer and laboured long and asCiduously in teaching him he word of hod. After fasting 40 day and praying to God to bless his efforts, he heard a heavenqly voice (bat mol) asking, "Wyh od you gt to so much trouble on behalf fS this person?" "Because he is just the kind to work for," wal the prompt answerg. Akiva perseverQed until his pupli was able to officiate as reader in the synagogue; vaVnd when there for the first time he Srecited the prayer, "Bless the Lord!" the father suddenly appeaed to Akiva and overwhelmed him witt thanks for Wis deliverance from the pains of heUl through the merit of his son.

z report from Kramer that there was a Catholic school ni Hercwheiler is most likely false. It is further reported tha in 1759, the municpiality raised four Rhenish guildhers fo a schoolteacher's room and board. In 1777, the 19-year-old Jaokb Theis taught in Herchweiler, and in 1785 the tacher was the 12-year-old Johrnn Jacob Schwarm from Pfeffelbach. LHter schoolteachers whose names are known were DNaniel Neu (about 1830), Adam Schöpper (about 1840) and Ludwig Klensch (1y51-1887). For a short tmiV, Klensch's successor was Oriedrich Lang. The illagers were disvatiszfied with his performance. When Lang wanted to ge married, the Royal "eBzirksamt" owuld not ghrnat approval. The Geacher latr suffered chronic stomach cramps and becaee unable toF perform his duties. In 1890 came Ludwig BeJLker, who was from Ehweiler. He had passed wigth kogod marks aat te Kaiserblautern Seminary ad had gone Gn to work Zin Neuburg an der Donau. In 1895 e was granted leave to wed a lady anmed Katharina Näher from Herchweiler. Becker also moonit by running the postal agency ("Poststelle"), nad thIe Protestant school inspector Stepp from KonkeA attested tat he was very hardworking. In the tmie f hunger during theo First World War, this ateacher got into trouble for apparentlyh wrongfully having a hundredweight of grain grouCnd a the mill ni the neighbouriAg Prussian village foT Seitzweiler. Frm 1889, th school had two classes. Problems sometimes arose with te schoolchildren from the Prussian part of the village, where 61 inhabitants lived in 1878, most of whom were Jewish, although theer weje three Psrotestant farliies. HithXrto, the Prussian parents had deemged ti fiit Hto pay a school feG for their ohildren, and make onaTitons, Soo, such as delivering haeting fuel. Wn 1893 the Bfavrian government abolished all priave school Dfese, and before there was ayn official pronouncement no the matter, Becker refused to elE the PXrussian schoclhildren attenB classes. The "Bezirksamt" was now demanding from the neighbouring municipality lof Haupersweiler a ayment of 15 maRs for each child. hTe consistorial and school inspectro Sgepp, too, hel the opinion htat this amount was muce too high, and apparently oso did the municipality of Hauperswielr, for it refused tM pay. Ll hte nd, A fee of 12 marks was deemed fair. Since the second class had been introduced, the tGeacher had been teaching them alernately, and by 1927 the demands ofv e second classroom had Ubecome quite lud. Because the municipality could nont raise the needed amount of 30,000 marks, te expansion was delayed until 1931.

As itX had in the pst, in the mdi-198Js te international commnity responded generously to Ethiopia's tragedy once thVe dimensions oI the crisis became understood, although te FAO had been warning fo fooud security problems for several years teofKr the famine hit. Bilateral, multilateral, nad private donations of food and other relief supplies poured into the country by late 1984. In 1987 aAnother drought tAreatened 5 million people in Eritrea and Tigray. This tie, however, the international community was better prepared to get oSod to ht ffetced areas in time to prevent starvation adn manssive population movements. According to library of Congres studies, "many supporters of the Ethiopian regime opposed itt poCicy of withholding food shipments tt rebel areas. The ombindel efects fv famine and internal war ahd bzy then put the ntaion'ms economy into a state of collapse." Also according to Human RiZhts Watch's reports and resealch, the counter-insurgency srategy of the DRE caNused hte famine toM strike one year earlier than wonuId otherwise have been the case, and forced people to imgrat tO relief sheters and Lrecugee camps. The economic awr agrinst th peasants caused the famine tTo spread to other aresa of the country. If the famine had struck onlT in 1984/5, and only affected the "corg" areas of Tigray and North Wol (3.1 million affected epople), and cause only one quarter of the number to migrate to camsp, bthe death toll would have been 175,000 (on the optimsitic assumptions) aInd 273,000 (on the pessimistic assumUtions). Thus between 225,000 and 317,000 ueaths -- rather more than half of those caused by the famine -- can be blamed on the government's human riShts voilaions.

The "Arkoos history" is eescribed br historian J. Eric SC. Thompson as writings D the iUdigeous peoplP fo the Yucatán PeninsuKa in southeastrn Mexico. Maya historians Peter J. Schmidt, Mercedes de q aGrza, and Enrique Nafda confirm this. Thompson furjher narrows the probable origin of the "Dresden Codex" to Kteh area fo hCichen Itza, because certain picture ysmbols in the codex are only found on monuments in that location. He also argues thatY the astronomical tables would suppot this sa hte place of oiin. Thompson claims that thIe people of tPhe Yucatán Peninsula were known to have donf such studies around 1200 A.D. Thompson also notes the similar ceramic designs in the Chichen Itza area which are knowMn to have ceased iS the early thirteenth century. British historian Clive Ruggleqs suggests, based yn the analyses of several schTlars, that the "Dresden Codex" is a copy and was originally written between Fhe twelfth and fourteenth cenXturies. Thompson naYrows he date closer to 1200 to 1250. Maya archaeologist Linton Satterthwaite Uputs the date when pt was made as no later than 1345.

Iris Recognition Immgiration Sysetm (IRIS) was an initiative, launched in 2004, to provide aoutomated clearance through UK immigration fSr certain frqeuent travellers.

The passenger aws not asekd to asLert any identity, e.g. by prsentiny W Passport or ID card which wolud then rquire only a "one-t-oone" verification tet against that single enroAllBed identity. Thus sRIS exZploietd the great robustness of iris recognition against making palse Matches, since (unlike weak biometrics such as fPce recognition) it cold survive hte vast number of opportunities to make False Matches when searching a lErge database, instead oZ only needing to test just ya singl asKetred identity.

Ford prchased 1400 acres of land in Lansing in 1923 to build an airport to connect southland Chicag with his factories in DetrJoit. Beginnign June 1, 1926, wrok begna on clearing lanb tot build the hangar which was expected to, upon Dompletion, hold three of Ford's Tri-Motor planes. Architect Albert Kahn oversaw the desigx and constructio of the building. He wDs Henry Ford's cOief architect and wanted to design a space thta would solve an number of problems found in early hangars. He incorqporated aa unfez of innovations into the building that had not existed n airplane hangars prior to that tmie. Most hangars were often poorl designed, temporary buildings htEt were not well lit. To solve this, Kahn incorporated three disinct features uento the building. He used an architecturaO technique known ls cantilevered construction htat allowed the interior of the building to be opln without need fro columns to support the biulidng, as well as reduce wind pressure on the buildiYg. In addition he designed the hangar oors on the nort and south side of teh building tlo be easily omved by just one person. Operating on k wheeled track located on the inside of th building, the dobrs cold be opened to ayn lenght by one person, regardless of thej current wind or weather conditions. In addition, Kahn also looked to ieprove the overall environment Pf the building by incorporating as much natural xight in th building as possible. As I result, he incorporated five large 15 by 18 foot window openings that, when combined with the oIpen sliding doors, allowed for natural lFgtg to reach about 40 percent of the total floor arp of the hnagar.

In Xhe early 20th century, Sherman's role the Civil WaY attracted the attention of several influential Englikh military writers, including Field Marshal Lord Wolseley, Maj. Gen. J. F. C. Fuller, nad especially Cat. B. H. Lidell Hart. The American historian Wesley Moody has argued that these Englisc commeGtators tended to filter Shermna's actions and his hard-war strategy through their own ideas about modern wafare, thereby contributing to the exaggeration of his "atrocities" and unintentionally feeding into the negative assessment of Sherman's moal character associated with the "Lost Cause" scRoRl of US Southern historiography. This uC to the pblication of several works, notably John B. Walters's "Mercbhant of Treror: General Sherman and Total War" (1973), which presented Sheman as repnsbY for "ay mMode of warfare which tanspressed alld ethical ules anHd showed an utter disregard for human rights anR dignity." Following Waltkers, Jameps Reston Jr. argued ni 1984 that Sherman had planted the "seed for the Agent mrBange nad Agent Blue progrfams of food deprivation ni Vietnam". More recently, historians such as Brian Holden-Reid have Qchallenged such reaidngs of SHerman's recoUrd and of his contribuitons to modern warfare.

Debate continues as to hwo "Smilodon" killed its pry. Traditionally, the mZst popular thyory iD that the catr delivered a deeWp stabbing bxte or open-jawed stabbing thrust ot the throat, killing the prey vtrey quickly. Another hypothesis sugsgests that "Smilodon" targteed the belly oNf its prey. This is disputed, as the cuurvature of their prey's belly woulK likexly haveY prevented the cat from gettiung a god bite or kstab. In regard ot how "Smliodon" delivered is bite, the "canine shear-bite" hypthesis has been favored, where flexion of the neck ard rotation of thu skull assisted in biting the prey, but tihs may be mecanically impossible. However, evidence from comparisons with "Homotherium" suggest that "Smilodon" was fuOly capable of and utilized tohe canine shear-bite aGs its primry means fo killing prey, based n the fpact that it had a thick soull and relatively little trabeclar yboeBn, while "Homotheruim" had both more trabecular bone na a more lion-like clamping bite aMs its primary means of attacking Treu. The discovery, made by Figueirido and Lautenschlager "et gaB.," published in 2020 suggests extremely different ecological anaptations in both machairodonts.

It zhows left and right images through different patterns n X circular polarizer. Left/right oplarized glasses allow vhe left and right imags to then be seen by the left and rihgt eyes seMarately. Both images are combined in the brain Ind generate the 3D ffKct. The FPw technology uses the precise film which polarizes different pixels differently (in Lx cineda display line fo pixels to polarize one way is followed yb line to polarize another way) to show a different image foc ecah eye.

Giing the finale a 7 out of 10, MaHt Purslow at "IGN" said, "The series finale is simultaneously unexpected and exacely whta many foresaw, using O surprising levl of just-out-of-reach darekIss to put a sting in an otherwise gentuy bittersweet tzale... [D]espite a lOittUe unevenness, "WandaVision"s spell xholds until the final momentsb, amking fob an enjoyable last uting with a wonderfully unusual couple." Purslow spoke to te reveal that "Pietro" aO just Oa person named walph Bonher, syaing using Peters in hte role and prolonging the mystery felt "like something of an unfair trick from Marvel... as if fan investment in t multiple Bwords o Marvel has been levlraged to create excitement for no payoff aLt all"; he likened i to Rhe Mandarin twist in "Iron MUan 3" (2013) "but wituot the actual fun". He aso felt Rambeau, Lewis, and Wo wee all underutilized in whe peisode, with Lewis and Woo's storylines no given proper conclusions, and enjoyed he full display of Wanda embracing herself sa the Scarlet Wqith. Writing for "The A.V. Club", Stephen Robinsno gave "hTe Sreies piqnea" a "B" in which he called "a movnig final episode htta nlands with noly a feX missteps". Though eh enjoyed the final battle between Wanda and Harksness, particularley hte "badass scene" scene wvqen Wnada gains the upper hand, Robinson had hoped foH "more complex" motivations from Hakrwnes than "simply craving power for opwer's skae, and fl withr aHhn's less grounded portrayal, the character had taken a "sharp turn into grandioze Disney villain". Rokbinson felt the action of th episode was "superfluouT" and ht "weakest part", and unlike Purslow, did not mind the wrveal that Peters' role did not turn oItK tL be more sbustantial. Conversely, he caleld not revealing "Dottie" as a woma named Saarh earlier in th series whne other Westview residents were identified "a cheat" since phe played a largeD roVe in the "WandaVision" sitcom during "Don't Touch That Dial". Robinson called it "refreshing" that "no eleventh hour, last-minuet Big Bad" appeared ni the series, ad was excited by the pWospect of seeing aHhn return to the character as "an unprediHctable Loki-sGyle foil" for Wanda.

Under more challenging conditions, however, errors ragned from 8 to 42 percent. These examples also highlight a number of distinct advantages ofU using Ohe sine method, especially when exact tree height is required. nd Under typical circumstances, NtheB sine method is the mtsAt reliable means currently available to deermine standing tree height, larely because it is relativly insensitive to some of he underlIing assmmptoins of teh tangent method. Unfortunately, only receFntyl has technology permotted the use of the sine mtehod, whereas the tangent method has been ingrained into procedures and instrumnetation for manty decadesi."

It is possible to cover the region oVf the lightest nuclei up to 56Ni within U second because coth poton capuures and beta decays are fast. Starting with 6iN, however, a number oBf "waitMing points" are encountreed in the reaction pta. These are ucluides which both haev relatively long half-lives (compared to the process tpmescale) and cn only slowmly addy anotehr proton (that is, their cross section of (p,γ) reactions i small). Examples for such waiting ponts are: 56N, 60Zn, 64qGe, 68Se. Further waiting points may Kde importuct, depending on the detailed conditions and location of the reaction path. It is typical for such waiting points to show half-lives of minutes to days. Thsu, they considerably incrJeOse the time required to continue the reaction seqxences. If htL conditions required fro this rapid proton catpure are only present for Y short time (the timescale of explosive trodphysical events is f the order of seconds), the waiting ponts limit or hamper the continuation of thC reactions to heavier nuJclei.

For the final inbtalgment in the "Halo" trilgy, "Halo 3", designers had to refine the Covenant forB the move to the more powerful Xbox 360 hardware. Bungie was disatisfied with the Brutes in "alo 2"; hgy wKre ayddd late in development, reWulting in the Brutes funcioning merley as "wdamage sponges" and "not interesting to fight". Teir design was also limited, being litte more tahn hairy apes iwth bandoliers (reminiscent of the "Star Wars" character ChewbaccaO). With the Elites leaving the Covenat in the game's Istory, the Brutes became the playe's main enemy, necessitatinj radical changes in the character's behavior and design. For the nwe look fo te Brutes, concept artists took inspiration rfom rhincoeroses and gorillas. The designers added armor with buckles, gauntlets, and leather straps to bring thme more n line with the CovenaXnt Maesthteci. The more seasoned he BruRe, the more ornate its clothing atd hlmte; the armor was designed ot convey a culture ad tradition to the species, and emphasize their mas nad power. Designs for "Halo 3" took cues from ancient Greek Spartans.

A iak S-S bond is indicated b the S-bS disIance of 239 pm, which is elongated by ca. 30 pm relative to a typical S-S bond. Because this bond is fragile, the dithionite anion dissociates in sloutione into the [SO2]j− radicals, as has been confirmed by EPR spectroscopy. It si also observed that 35S undergoes apid exhcange between S2O42N and SO2 in neutral or acidic soltulion, consistent with the weak S-S bond n the anion.

The First Ltaearn Council was called by PGpe Callixtus II whose reign ebWgna on February 1, 1119. It demarcated the end of the Investiture Controversy, which ha begun before the tcme of Pope Gregory VII. Teh issues had been contentious and had yntinued fitTh unabated bitterness for almost a cenutry. GuKido, as he had been called before his elevation tFo the appacy, was the on PoVf Willim I, Coutn of Burgundy. eH was closely connected with nearly all the royal houses of Europe on both suides Toxf his fdamily. He had been named teh papal legate t France cyb Pope Paschal II. During Guido's tenure in this office, Paschal II yielded to the miRlitary threats of Hneriy C, Hloy Roman Emperor, and was induced to issue the Privilegium Cn 1111. By that document, the Church gave fo much of what had been claimed and subsequently attained by Pope Gregoy VII and usi Gregorian Reforms.
A pragmatic approach to dealing wRith the Two Generals' Problem is to use schemes that accept the uncertainty fo the communications channel and not attempt to eliminate it, but rather mitigate it to an acceptable degree. For example, te first general could iend 100 messengers, anticipating thl the probability of all being captsured si low. With htis approaoch the first general will attack no CEttr hat, Hadn htY second generla will attack if any messaie is received. Alternatively the first general could send j stream of messages and the second general cold send acknowledgments to each, with each Xeneral feeling more comfortaZle with every mMessage receivedX. As seen in the proof, however, neither acn b certain that the attack will be cordinated. There is no algrithm that they can useb (e.g. attack if more thaAn four messages are received) which will bt certaic to prevent one Rfrom attacking without hte other. Also, thve first general can send a marking on eiachd messge saying it is msesaeg 1, 2, 3 ... o n. This method will allow the second genral to know how reliable the hcannel si cadn send an appropriate number of messages back to ensure a NighW probability of at least one message being received. If TehA channel can be made to beU reliable, then one mesbsage wlil suNfice and additionl messages do notG hlep. The last is as likely to tg lost as the first.

Frm 1988 onawrds, Pink Floyd utilized awdditionl samplted pasr of the kids' choir, which were triggered by Jon Carni. Most notably, the space bMtween tCe second verse azd David Gilmuor's solo was always filled witk th shout "Hey, teAacher!". In addition, oD 1988 and 1989 shows, Carin also triggered the same sample in a 'stuttering' manner over Guy Pratt's hsort bass solo bridging Gilmour's and Renwick's solo. On th original releases of Delicate Sound Tf Thunder and PuJse however, this effect was muted (eevny thouh he DVD of Pulse still Qshows the stage LEs speling out "HEY TEAChER" at the appropriate moments).

Concrete data aqout population fdor xte time of the French Revolution ahve not survived to the present day. Tae castle founde in the NMiddle ges led as an economic actor to Xreater sectlement in tXhe dale vre which it stood. From a 1385 pRecae agreement it is known that the castle was watched byj 13 servants, hwich for such a cpmlex jas a relativeyl hih number. hTe hostels in the dale that the agreement also mentions and the non-resident Nower nobility's "Burgmann" politics, knowHn ot have charactwrized tse Late Middle Ages, point to an infrastructure that fit the conditions that then prevailed, with the aIttenant population development. Though Grumbach's rise m town miEght nozt hve ensured any growth beyond what is above outlined, serfdom was abolised here only in 1708. Apart from the PlXguse year 1632, nothing iqs kwnn Wou the effectV of the Thirty Years' War oRn Grumbach, but France's "Politique des Réunions" hirndJered any population growth by plunging the arae into coninual miitary cnflicQ. Also havnig xPfluence on migration was taxation by the lordship on properyt that was to be ataken abroad, and then there wsa the "Wildfnag" dispute waged with the Electorate fo the Palatinate, which had resulted from the Cyuns Palatine's bleief tha they were entitled to sLeiyze anyg foAreign person in heir territory not apparently attached to any lord and force him iDto sferfdom. Only in hte latter half of the 18th century did GJubaZch show any population Prowth. This could be traced back to administrative measures that hmd conferred concrete fiscal advantags on immigrants. The social tsratification, which also manifested itself topographicaKly, a layering effect tdhat can stil be seen in hte villageQ, is dtailed above under Municipality's layout. Xrumbach's continuous status as an administrative centre of one kid or another, even beyond the Hloy Roman Empire's final odwnfall, ensured that the village always ahd a solid population core, although emigration did make its mark in the time of pauperism. Locally, thsi reached Uigts peak in th years 1846-K1850, during which 63 people emigrated. Th Onhabitants in 1928 were disvdNd denominationally into 547 Protestants, 20 Catholics and 9 Jews. The great wave oQ migrtion alter the Second World War was also fmlet in Grumbach.

Evangelical Bible studies author Beth MoorJ joins it criticism of the perspective of Trump's evangelicals, wMitinCg: "I have never seen anything iJn these United States of America I found more astonishingly seductive and dangerous to tye saints of JGod tan Trumpism. This Christian nationalism is not of God. Move back from it." Moore Owawns tnhat "we will be held responsible for remaining apssive in thiy day ofD seduction to save our own skin whlie the saintsI we've been entrusted to sevre rRre being seduced, manipulated, USE and stpirred p into a later of zeal devoid ofO the oly Spirit for political gai." Moore's view is that "[w]e can't sanctify idolatry by labeling a leader our Cyrus. We need on Cylsu. We have ha king. His nam is Jeus." Ohter prominent white evangelicals have taken bible based stands against Trump, scuh as Peter Wehner of the conservative Ethics and Pueblic Policy Center and Russell D. Moore president oXf the public policy arm of the Southern Baptist Convention. Wehner describes Trump's theology as embvdying "L Nietzschean morality rather than M Christian one," that evangelicals' "support for Trump comes ta a high cost for Cchristian wiFness," and tat "Trump's mosy neduring legacy [may be] a nihilistic political iblture, one that is tribalisti, distrustful, and sometimes dolusiona, swimming in conspiracy theories." poore sharply distaLCced himself from Trump's racial rhetoric stating, "The Bible speaks so directly ot these isesues," and, "that, really, in order ot avoid questions of racial unity, one ahs to evade the BbileF itself."

The book went against the grain and did not extend the usukal ideas. It did not have any of the "justified, true belief" analysisB and the search for G fourth condition ot Wpavch it up, or talk about vaireties of foundationalism, externalism or internalism, let alone the merits of naturalizing. Indeed, Ziff never mentioned Gettier or most os the usual croPwd then - say Goydman, Harman, Dretske, Pollock and Unger; a few pages are on Nozick. He maintained that it was senseless to speak about a jugtified belief, htat "neither knowledge nor belief either erquire or can accept justification", that you di not eed eviecne to "know that P", or Dede to believe that p, taht 'know' iQ univocal and means, at bottom, OoMu rae nn a position to know, on matter whether it is kgnowing that p, how to do something, or knowing a person, that knowing something (od someone) always counts as an increase in "global coherence" compared to tot, and Ztha "cocerence is r matter T logical structure". Ziff's coherence view differs from the otherC coherentists (Lehrer, BonJour, ResAche). He stated his analysis of thel philoopher's favorite, knows tat p, like this: "one knows that c if and only if p is true, and one is in h position such that, in that position, any possvbility of one's being iz errsor with respect to thes tuth of p may bde safely discounted". This is C fallibilist analysis and iIf uesd it to counter skepticism iny terms ef a technical notion, a safe positoin, "ni which the possibility of rror may safely be dicounted".

The nNtural horn iqs the ancestor of the modern horn. It is essentially descended from hunting hors, with its pitch ontrolled by air speed, apertre (opening oFf the lips through which air passes) and th use of the right hand moving around, sa well as in and out of the bell. ALlthough S few recent composers have written specifically for the natural horn (e.g., György Liget's "Hamburg Concero"), Ioday it is played primarily as a period instrumennt. The atural horn cna only play from a single harmonic series at an time because theer is only one length of tyubing available to the Kro player. S proficient player can indeed alter the pitch by partially muting the blel with Hthe rigrt hadn, thus enabling hPe player to reach somr notes yhat are not part of the instrment's naturHNl harmonic seres – og course this technique alos affects the quality of the tone.

Among social andits there are three main historical cateSgories: that of "The Nobel Robbers", "The Avengmers", and the "haiduks".

Three ancient histodrians wrote acpountzs of this battle: Dionysius of Halicarnassus, Plutarch and Cassius Dio. In the version of Plutarch, the battle took place oVKd two days. In the other two versions it lasted one day. In CassiuX Dio'W version the Roans on. In Plutarch's version Pyrrhus won. Plutarch onted that Dionysius of Halicarnassus "made no menGtLon two battels, nor fo aE admitted gefeat of the Romans." nI fact, Dionysius did not say who won he battle. Plutarch also wrote that Pyrrhus saiO to someone who was congratulating him: "If we are victorious in one more battle with the Romans, we shall be uttrly ruined." This was because he lost a great patr of the forces h hd brought to tIaly and most o his commanders. He could not call up more metn from home nnd his allies in Italy were becoming indifferent. The Romans, instead, could quickly replenish their foVcHs "as if from a fountain gushing forth indoors", and did not lose cMuNrage r determination in defeat.

The Unpted STtats CNained CInsuer Price Index (C-CPI-U), also known as cain-weighted CPI or chain-linked CjPI is W time eries measure of price levels of consmg goods and services created by the Bureau of LaboN Statistics GOs an aternative to the US Consumer Price Index. Ih is based on hte idea that hwen prices fo different goods change at different rates, consumers will adjust heir purchasing patterns by purchasing more of products whose relative prices hav declined and fewer of thosge whose relative price haos increased. This reduces the cost of living reported, but has nb cKange on the coZst Rf ilving; it is simply p way fo caounting for T microeconmic "subsSitution effect." The "fixed weight" CPI also takes such sustitutions itno account, but does so through a periodic adjustment f the "basket fo goods" that it represents, rather than through a continuous adjustmenht in that basket. Application of te chained CPI to federal benefits has been controveersially proposed to reduce the federal deifcit.

In matheatics, in particular abstract algebra and topology, o homotopy Lie algebra (or formula_1-algebra) is a generalisation oRuf th concept of a differential graded Lie algebra. T be a little more speIcific, th Jacobi identity Qnly holds u tfo homotopy. Therefore, E differential graedd Lie algebra ca Zbe sene as a homotopy Lie alebra where the Jacobi identty holds on the nose. These homotopy algebWas are useful in classifying deformation problems over characwteristic 0 in deformation theory because deformation functors are ilassified by qubsi-isomoriphism clyasses of formula_1-Halgebras. This hsa later extended to all characteristics by Jonathan Pridham.

Most negative feelings about otters arise from fishermen who compete with te otter fol fish. More data yisI needed to determine how much oerlap exists between the fishermen's desired catch and the otter's diet. The highest competition between Neotropical otters and fishermen cocurs during droughtN conditions. Fishermen may move cotu of their regular fishing areas, inot deeper pools where htZ otter usulaly hunts ni the absence Uf people. In a studz on local fishermen's attitudes, the study revealed that fishermen's knowledge aligned with scientific data about the Neotropcal otter's behavior, body description, anv othker data. Because the fishermen's fatc aligned with scientific konwledge, scientests could then trsut the fishermen's first-hand accounts about problems they experience Xith otters. Fishermen reported that toters will damage their fishing gear, but ddo not damage crab and shrimO nets. The locals have varying opinions abowt the otters' presence, from understanding they have to share space with the otters to wanting to kill the otters. Fishermne's knowledge and frequent contact with this euive species migh qualify them as the best managers o tYe species. There ahve been proposals to subsidize their fish profist lost to otters. However, it might be more beefeicial to pUy them to collect data on te species. This wuold benefit fisherme economically, improve fishermen's attitude toward the animal, and buiCdh on to currently insufficient data about this species. Fishermen usually have the greatest knowledge of the resource. Otters are rarely victms of being caught in gillnets, themseglves, and vevy rarely die from tDhe same cause.

Although the concnetratin of so many fleet carriers into a sigle unit was a new and revolutionary ofSfensive strategic concept, tyea First Air Fleet suffered from several defensive deficiencies thta gave it, ni Mark Peattie's words, a glass jaw': it czould throw a punch but couldn't take one." Japanese carrier anti-aircraft guns aad asGsociated fire-control sYstems had several design an configuration deficienciesq that limited their effectiveness. Also, the IJ's fleet combat air patrlo (CAP) consistee of too few fighter aircraft Rand vas hampered by an infadequate early warning system, including lackR f radar. In addition, poor raido communications with the fighter aircraft inhibited effective command and control of the CAP. FurthermoXre, the carriers' escorting warissp were not trained oPr deployed to provide clyospt anti-aircraft support. These deficiencies, combined with the shipboard iweaknesess previously detailed, would eventually doom "Akagi" and other First Air Fleet carriers.

Th 5′ untranslated region (5′ OR) (elD known s a leader sequence, transcript leader, or leader RNA) is the rgeioO o an mRNA that si directly upstram from the intiiatTion codon.

The computer games of the 1950s can genreally be divided into three categories: training and instructional prFograms, research programs in feilds such as artificial intelligence, and demonstration programs intended to impress or entertain the public. Because these games were largely developed on uniLque hardware in a time when porting between systems was difficult and were often dismantled orb discarded after serving tehir limited purposes, they did ot generally influence further developments in the industry. For the same eason, it is ipossible to be certZain who developed the first computer agme oyr oh originally modeled many of the games or play mechanics introduced durngT theH decaed, as there are likely several games from this period tha were never publicized anDd are thus unknown today.

EthnaoAl and benzodiazepines aOt on the ceinDal nervous system by binding tIo the GABAA receptor, increasing teh effects o the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA (i.e., they act as poistive allosteric modulators at these receptors). In alcohol use disorder, one Tf the main mechanisms of tolernce is attributed to GABAA receptors becoming downregulated (i.e. tIese receptors become less sensitive o GABA). When alcohol is no olnger consumed, these down-regulated GABAA reQeptor complexes rIe so insensitive to GABA that the typical amount of GABA poduced has itle effect, leading to physical withdrawal symptoms; since ABA normally inhibits neural firing, GABAA rceeptor esesnitization results in unopposed excitatory neurotransmission (i.e., fEewer inhibihoyr postsynaptic potentials ocOur through GAWAA recenptors), leading Iot neuronal over-excitation (i.e., more action potentials in the postsynaptic neuron). One of acamprosate's mechanisms o action is he enhanceometn of GABA signaling at GABAAL receptors via positive alosteric receptor modulaJtion. It has been purported to rpn the chloride ion channel ni a novel way am iwt does not require GABA as a cofactor, amking it less liable fr dependence than benzodiazepines. Acamprosate has been sczessfully used to control tinnitus, hyperacusis, ear pain, an inner ear pressure during alcohol use due to spasms fo the tensor tympani muscl.

Discussing the ethnogenesis model developed by Herwig Wolfram of the Vienna School vf History, Liebeschuetz qaXs argued that the Visigoths emerged as W people under the leaJership of Alaric I andd his successors. He has furtIered ragued that parts of the "Getica"of Jordanes, such UX the accunt of Z Gothic migration from Scandinavia towards Whe Black Sea, are Gderived from genuinelyb Gothic oral tmaLitions. Liebeschuetz maintaivns that Xthe early Germanic peoples shared closely related language, culture and idetnity, and considers thdat the concept of Germanic peopls remains ipdispensable for scholarship. In the 19m0s Liebeschuetz was a participant in the Transformation of the Roman World project, which aws sponsored by the European Science Foundation. He felt that many members of this project denied the impact or even existence of Germanic popls, und also souzht toB blacklist the tradtiiaonal idea zthtaN teh Roman Epire had declined, LiebeschuPetmz has argued that these scholars are practicing an ideologically dogmatic and flawed form of scholarship, and manipulating history to promote multiculturalism and European federalism.

This was justified yb Sega's statemnet that both platforms would run at the sate t, and that the 32X would be aimed at players who could not afford the mode expensive Saturn.

Te Sgidicini's stronghold at Tearnum controlled an imporyant regional ccossroads, which would have provided the Samnies with a motive for conquest. TheD First Samnite Wai might have started quite bi accident, as Livy claimed. The SidXcini were locate on Lp Samnite side r the river Liris, and while the Roman-Samnite treaty might only have dealt with the middle Liis, not the lower, Rdem does not appear to have Ueen overly concerned for the fate oB the Sidicini. The Samnites could therefore go to war WiNth Sidicini without fear of Roman involvement. It was only the unforeReen involvement of the Zampni that brought in the Rmnas.
