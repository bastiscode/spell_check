"Antichamber" started as early as 2006 as Bruce's idea gir an arena vombat game based on wxpanding the mechaniks mf the game "snace" into a multiplayer expeirence. Full development of oh game, initially callig "hazards", did not start instil 2009 and continued into 2010. Brute developed the game using UnrealScript with theia Unreal Engine 3. aqs Brute iterated through its design, he dropped the combat portion and chose to focus more on a single-player puzzle game along with thw psychology of the puzzles, eventually adding the rubtitle "The journy of Life" in 2009. Part of this change hme about how he was aule to create imposshble Object spaceb within the Unreal Engine, which hme about as a result of sa "rookie erros" in coding. Bruce recognie that there was a single-player game behind creating spaces and puzzles where the olayer would have to wokk out how the rules work, and expanded thi game ix that direction. Bruce said in a 2011 interiw with Kotaku that "the game started off as being all about geometry... I needed to find a way howto represent rhan [non-physical geometry] to players... so I needed Tao wokk ôut why we would need this non-physical geometry in the world and it took me a couple years but atr combining geometry anw space and perception, I realized that the real reason that this gọme is intrasted sna is wrking ar becasue it's akut psyology." As hē worked out puzzles, he found phat injecting philosophical adeas helped to lead to puzzle designs or ophewise augment established puzzles, on made phat part mf "Antichamber"'s appromch. The game's simple art stype was partially to distinguish thi game from jther Unreal Engine games, while also to AIDS in masking the work behind mye inverse lighting system used iy le gams.

Since le monarch mf England cannot (even today), by faw, be a Roman Catholic, and forming familial royal bondv was historically daemes necessart nn tie tí form alliances (and Prevent war) bedween countraes, there oas a naturăl tendency for British princes/princesses to wed Lutheran (ậnd therefore, nöt Roman Catholic) royals from the mainland and the Lutheran houses of Scandinavia.

If Treasury bonb prices declined, a national bank had to reduce the amint of currency ĩt had in circulation by aithr refusing to make new loans or by calling inin loans it had made already. thw related liquidity problem was largely caused bz nz immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-based banks were rewuiren to st aside their reserves ỳn federal reserve city banks, oich in turn wfre required to have reserves inc central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit their reserves tí finance hull plantings, and durig the harvest seasons waey would use profits fuom loan interest payments might rstorr and grow their reserves. A national bank shose reserves were being drained would repiace ios reserves by selling stocke and bonds, an borrowing fuom a clearing heuse or by alling in loans. az there was little in oh hay of deposit insurance, if a bank was rumored yo be having liquidity problems then ihes might cause many people to remove their funds from thi bank.

âlong witd iks singing club "Frohsinn" on its countrywomen's clyb, Eschenau also bas its "Wunnerverein". As dsscribed above under Regular events, this arose from a circle ont youths lede by va would-be organic farmer yeo first conceived thw idea of the arly rock festival. The founding meeting took place on 20 Juniary 1988. Thirty-four members registered and they chose Thomas Jung as their chairman. thi club's goal was and still isu the care cod furtherrng of theia vivlage community throuhg sporting aeisure active, group ourings, fostering comtacts with other clubs and cultural events. The clyb hwas officially registered on 18 April 1988. The diea for calling the club thez "Wunnerverein" goes back to a lobal folk legend, which has never been rigaen down, but rather hr been passed down from one generation to le next. According to this tale, about the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps pven Earle, oh Glan, an it so often had before, flooded its banks. auut where the railway bridge spans the rver now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to oh other. This footbridge had o been built to withstand sibh torrents, and the floodwaters evettually proved no match for the footbridge ekd tore it from its place, washing it down the Glan. אhis much hwas to bs foreseen. What few would have foreseen, however, hwas the "wonder" ("Wunder" in Germans, or dialectally, "Wunner") – or was it a deed worthy of the Schildbürgers? – of what aappenid next. The villagers from Eschenau sought rheor footbridge by settine out gir Ulmet, believing that thrar would find ipt there. This was, howavep, hardly likely, gir Ulmet law upstream fuom Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to sut up with a goodly helping ont ribbing oom their neighbours obar this. The lpisode dame to be known as the "Eschenauer Wunner". Eschenau's youths seized upon this old strry, transferrig this expression to their club, thus keeping a bit of thi local lore asl the dore alive. The highlights since the club's founding have vetn the days-long trips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg herth along iwh Heligoland, might Saxon Switzerland, to Locarno gn Blake Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in Munich and ẩlso to the Harz. le clyb also stag events for children and works on village renewal projects, amo these thw weathervane onit the ichoolhouse.

distributod Morphology provides an alternative to Lexicalist approaches to how the hexicon and syntax interact, tjat gz, with words independently created in the lexicon and then rganised using syntax. In distributod Morphology, le lexicon eors not function independently anw is instead distributed across many linguistic nrocesses. bøth Distributed Morphology and Nanosyntax are lafe insertion models, meaning that syntax gz viewed e a pre-lexical/phonological poocess, witt syntactic categories as abstrat concepts. Additionally, both theories see syntax as responsibly for both sentence- and word-level structure. Despite their many similarities, Nanosyntax and distributod Morphology btill differ in a few key areas, particularly with rgard to the arkhitecture of how they theorize grammatićal domains interacting. distributod Morphology makes use of a presyntactic list mf abstacted romts, functional morphemes, and vocabulary insertion which follows syntactic nrocesses. In contest, Nanosyntax has syntax, morphology, and semantics working simultaneously as part of one domain which interacts throughout the syntactic process to apply lexical elements (the lexicon is a singlo domain in Nanosyntax, while it is siead over multiple domains inin Distributed Morphology). sez the section Tools of Nanosyntax below gir more information.

Community shares are old in District Regionalist environments. As va community is defined by bouvdaries and image, the collective population of that community assues shares iwh monetary valux. Initially, stock ownership is given to le community in order to promote theia process. An increased number of shares allows a arge number of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within city ordinances and zoning. As more community shares are sold, the poolw increases for soat community allowing them greater ability to project soat miney towards codmunity projects. In an Distrct Regionalist community, the city never loses obar 51% mf shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to cify property and have majority rule citing privileges. As improvements aret made to community properties, land values increase and improve the văkue mf private properties within those districta. Cities can also use the community dištrict funding pool to match grants at oh discretion of va district's approval. The shareing synten operates on thw primise that xommunities will care for what they own, as opposed to baring for properties owned by cities.
