and please tell me how much money i am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation.
these improvements will be involved by the lack of petrol and non-renewable energy.
these are some points i want to mention about the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
then the show was supposed to start at 19.30 hours but it started at 20:15, more than half an hour late.
that was fantastic!
there were some people around but i was afraid to ask them the way.
it's not that problem that there was no more discount available-but i had chosen it, because i'm (allowed?).
while i will be at the camp i would like sailing, because it is my favourite sport.
i guess they will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because they want to change.
anyway, i really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month so that i'd like to write about it!
and, finally, right before the start they announced that danny brook would not be in the show that evening.
more and more people buy mobile phones, because they are very useful, you get a lot of possibilities like: using the internet, buying different goods, booking tickets, controlling your home technic and many others.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there.
in addition, the resort has an interesting historical background concerning the architecture and the best facilities and activities that you could have in mexico, for example, it provides different kinds of tours around mexico.
you also mention that your show would start at 19.30 but to my knowledge it started at 20:15 and that meant forty-five minutes of waiting.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (i am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choice).
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in their education, job and their marriage in future.
future students could appreciate coming if they could still do their sport.
firstly, the english lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving their knowledge.

anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
firstly, the english lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving their knowledge.
but also there are some notes that you should improve in next year's festival to make it absolutely wonderful.
i thought you understood '; please send money back to me, you know why, don't answer me?
also in the advertisement they talk about discount tickets.
this invention has made our lives easier and quicker.
i want to apologise to you, because i haven't written to you recently, but i want to tell you what happened to me last week. i had the opportunity to help at one of the most pop concerts in my city. so imagine, i felt really really good and excited. i don't have words to describe it but i will try to do it, ok?
suddenly i heard a noise from my garden and i wanted to know what it was, but it was impossible to do it.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before, and some women don't earn money. they have no idea how difficult it is to earn money.
in the end, i asked for i money back (and payment for my horrible night): do you think anybody will give me something back?!
they need to be with their family in peace.
it is easy to get there and free admission.
if there is no chance to go to california in july, i could wait until next summer.
well on march 11th there was a group here in brazil called "los jagoares", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favourites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
i got into the car and gave the jewellery in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
but other people don't think like this. for example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost.
chairs are not only part of the furniture, they are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums where they are art objects.
are there any discotheques or something? i would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her i can't be there.
you wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? i think this is the best choice for him!
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do.
at that time, i took the course which covered all the 4 kinds of strokes.
also it was written in the advertisement that some discounts were available, but there weren't any discounts.
in addition, shop owners often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secretly.
also there is a very good shopping centre next to the museum.
when i first heard about over the rainbow i was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when i heard about the extras that the circle theatre was offering, it became the best opportunity i ever had to attend a musical of that type, but instead of being the best evening i ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why i am writing to you.
it's also a really popular job among university students because of the good salary.
the activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in california).
i carried a lot of chairs and looked after the queue or people who lost their way.
there was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
there are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficult.
i could say that we cannot survive without them.
firstly, i read in the advertisement that the actor would be danny brook, and this is one of the reasons why i went to the theatre.
his mother always says: "if you are smiling and are nice to people, people will be nice and will smile at you".
these are only my immature views. if it is considerable for you, i will be very pleased. thank you very much.
about the size of houses, i think that in cities houses will be more and more small because of overpopulation.
for example, if diana, who was the ex-wife of prince charles, hadn't been followed by paparazzi when she was dating a man, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death.
emilio almodar, 18 years old, university student, and the career i have chosen is in international commerce or market.
firstly, this is because there are a lot of scandal magazine readers.
on the other hand, their stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create their own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
finally i want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
i look forward to hearing from you
they are human beings and they need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
i'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the three days that the class will spend in london.
they were eager to have a child, but they had never been able to.
the price was excellent because there wasn't any time limit.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this three-day programme in london and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.
when they finished singing the last song i was surprised when they called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people.
people like doing shopping (especially in poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for their cars, motorbikes or computers.
as and advise try to go shopping in the out pick hours, and don't waste your time asking for promotions advertised in the windows of the shop.
thank you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition. i also want to congratulate you on your excellent competition, thanks to which i have the opportunity to go to california, a place that i always wanted to go to.
another point that i want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the british health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
i think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
in your advertisement you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately i found out only six countries were represented.
i have further ideas. in the future, maybe in 2113, there will be houses like now but with more technical things.
in a supermarket, shop or department store they have many things.
hopefully i will meet some other girls interested in the same sport.
the people were wonderful, they were helping each other with everything and it was a lot easier to do.
on the other hand, their stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create their own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
and another question is what are the prices of things like there, which i want to know so that i can make a better budget for my trip.
and the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
in your letter, you asked me whether the book i've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday.
in conclusion, the advertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so i would like to ask for my money back.
we thought that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
it is as if they lose their conscience while they are shopping.
the talks by writers were very technical but they could be understood by all the people who were at the festival.
at the end of the conference there will be a reception at the hotel.
i was shocked and terrified the first time i saw them, but the truth is that they are men like us.
it's a great opportunity for me to participate in your camp california because normally i work a lot and i can't spend money on travel. moreover, i have to support a big family because i'm married and i have three children.
i was surprised that he believed me.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their money, or whether it was on june 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back-my bank account number is enclosed.
well on march 11th there was a group here in brazil called "los jagoares", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favourites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
i prefer that kind of accommodation because i can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but i can't have it in a tent.
these actors appeared forty-five minutes late according to what is written in your advertisement.
so her friends didn't realise that she knew about the party and they were very happy because they believed that the surprise party had been a success!
my name is joseph and i am writing this letter to complain about the mess that the administration of the circle theatre presented to me.
in my opinion, in a hundred years we'll wear the same kind of clothes that we wear nowadays.
there are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing, that all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well.
i got into the car and gave the jewellery in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
i think it's because the last time i travelled (with my friends), we stayed in log cabins, and when i was sleeping i felt something moving on my skin, then i woke up frightened and when i opened my eyes, i saw lots of big ants!
on the other hand, playing games and using a computer widens my brain so, as you can see, this modern stuff has got many advantages and disadvantages.
is it necessary to bring any money?
there wasn't any discount available for the tickets and i went to the theatre with my three cousins from brazil.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes their life miserable.
but it was unpleasant because of these things.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes their life miserable.
but are they useful in every situation and everywhere?
as i am specially fond of musicals, i even travel abroad to see what's new, i am probably one of your most devoted customers. i know this word is not the best but you have demonstrated that the theatre can be just as cold as any other business.
there are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
your advertisement mentioned that the famous danny brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unknown actor who starred instead of him.
in fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our family and carrying our luggage and shopping bags.
we waited there for forty-five minutes for it to start!
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about their last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
mind what you tell her; she can make the worst of it; gossiping is her favourite leisure activity!
about the gyms, i like them very much. those places have so many machines that you can easily lose weight and develop a wonderful body.
they are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because they cannot stop themselves unless they have not got money to spend.
all my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but i personally think that it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
well on march 11th there was a group here in brazil called "los jagoares", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favourites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. that was why our great plan for our holiday was not be real.
thank you for your letter, which arrived yesterday.
after all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
with reference to the accommodation i would rather stay in a tent because i think it is the best way to socialize.
we had never been to a musical show and we thought that it was a new opportunity.
in the past people didn't have electricity and if they wanted, for example, to read or to cook something they used to light a fire.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
often people can't buy a piece of bread. and they ask for money from other people.
well on march 11th there was a group here in brazil called "los jagoares", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favourites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
for the end-of-conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and they will provide us with live music and catering.
one day when i was there alone, i heard some other kids approaching. i sat down behind one of the stones so they couldn't see me.
