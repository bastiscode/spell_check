"Where else indeed." Thompson clapped his hands on his thighs and stood.
Mika had no rebuttal to that. She had graduated hundreds of optimistic students only to see their spirits crushed in the real world. Unless one was born to royalty in the inner circle or at least a board member, they usually became a number with little more than a desk and a divider to call their own. Shasa ran the risk of death every day, but at least she could move her desk when she needed to.
"Little Jack, I'm nove," Lancaster said, letting him know he was all right. "Find a place to park Odin's Revenge and I'll find my way up there."
The wagon rumbled forward toward the gatehouse, people passing by on foot and on horses, but Erynn kept her eyes down and tried not to think about anything but getting through the gate. Soon the shadow of the gatehouse loomed ahead. Then she was through it and into the outer ward. And finally, minutes later, she was through the main gatehouse and out on the road, making her way down the long winding hill towards the village.
In many cases the criminal justice system used the police to enhance charges on Blacks for alcohol, and marijuana (the least detrimental substance to health in this society). The modern day conspiracies are better known as today's Jim Crow Laws, which are being connected to lives to continually undermine people by use of criminal charges. Other plots (attachment of felonies to minor offenses) are also being used to eliminate black college prospects from being considered for employment.
"What's that?"
36:11 - "My experience has been that no ghost can get past a seashell holding rosemary if those two objects are bound together by a red thread." I said. "There's a huge rosemary bush growing in the front yard! Those of us without bags can arm ourselves with it."
Monty slowly frowned. "But what about you, Googie?"
"Now it's switched off," Lian replied after she had pressed something on her wristwatch.
#2 Southern California routed Texas Christian, 51-0. #3 Oklahoma met #4 Ohio State in Columbus, with the Sooners edging the Buckeyes in a close game, 29-28. #5 Penn State beat Maryland, 27-9. #6 Texas A&M won on the road against #7 Texas Tech, 33-17.
But not this time.
"You could have just asked!" I rubbed the spot on my chest, wincing slightly.
"What?"
Men cleared, making way for her. Noriko looked up at her. The Commander gave pause, looked at Masaru. "We have to go."
Slowly, Kellen was forming the words to reply to him. But before she could utter a single syllable, an unfamiliar face approached their booth. A tall woman, brunette, dressed well and impeccably put together.
Meanwhile the gunship had landed, and the remaining rebels disposed of. No quarter being shown to those who surrendered or were wounded during the battle. Happier than ever to see the welcome sight of the ship that would transport them out of there, the other commandos made a beeline for the ship while the gunners left the ship and went to Grim's aid, hauling a handcuffed Caskar on board.
22 That ye put off concerning the former conversation the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; 23 And be renewed in the spirit of your mind;24 And that ye put on the new man, which after God is created in righteousness and true holiness. (Ef. 4:22).
"No, what? What no? All I'm saying...." Ruiz stopped at the duffel bag by the front door, slowly lifting the center flap. Resting on top was Beth's case file and a large spiral-bound notebook dogged by years of travel and scribblings. The past that refused to stay where it belonged. Loren moved away from the mantel, stepped beside the man he had called friend, and closed the bag once more.
"You know it," she replied, allowing him to pull her to her feet.
Erynn hated his tone, but was almost too hungry to care. The men left behind to watch them had given them some stale biscuits and water—untying their hands for several minutes each so they could eat. But it hadn't done much to curb her hunger and she was starving. As she tore into the roll, Briggs started pacing back and forth in front of them.
Lancaster saw a rather intriguing door with the artwork of a serpentine dragon drawn on it, though rather than looking fierce, the dragon's face drooped almost as though it was sad. Lancaster reached for the button on the door to slide it open and Little Jack stopped him suddenly. The emotion in his voice caused him to be louder than usual.
Compared to information available about criteria and DRI, often discussion of the choice of evidence is missing in reports addressing dietary guidelines. Both the WHO/FAO and NHMRC have issued useful rankings of the criteria describing the strength of evidence (Tables 4.3 and 4.4). However, these rankings of evidence do not provide clear guidance for setting dietary recommendations, but rather discuss the general strength of evidence.
• When Samuel L. Clemens was 11, his father died. Young Sam dropped out of school, then began work as an apprentice in a printer's shop to help support his family. Then he worked under his older brother, Orion, at the newspaper called the Hannibal Journal.

"Orel, please forgive him," Enriki asked. "He'll buy two 'royal' slaves for you. He promises."
Little does she know that the emotional, physical, and most of all, spiritual, challenges she faces on the tour, are only a type of rehearsal for what is to follow upon her return to her 'normal' life.
"Maybe you were right, and we should just go home. We should just let things follow their course..." But I can't. I can't after all I've been through. I can't after my awareness.
When that was done, I jogged back to the street in front of the facility, checking it again for any sightseers.
16 | Analysis of food consumption survey data for developing countries, 1980 (E F S)
She halted in front of him, right in his personal space, the toe of her shoe practically bumping the toe of his boot and Ethan felt his blood pressure rise fifty points.
"Thank you, Miss Dessande! We'll start next Sunday at eleven. Come to the beach in front of Academy."
"I fear our food supply has just about run out," she informed him. "Had I known I would be accompanying you on this journey, I would have packed more."
"Hm, yes," said Ulrike. "Well, I guess it mostly comes from the chemical factories in Bitterfeld, and I don't think those have all been closed or modernised yet."
Downtown at a bus stop. Nameless waited. She was not sure where to go. Lots of things were bothering her. She felt jumbled up inside. How can someone who has nothing still go on losing things? she wondered. How can someone who has nothing still have things to lose? The number Fourteen bus arrived, people got off, and people got on, and Nameless stood there waiting. She couldn't take that bus. She didn't have any money. She couldn't take the number Sixteen either. She couldn't take the Twenty-Two. All these buses came and went and Nameless, still there waiting.
Marcus pedaled up to the grand front gates of MGM and got off his bicycle. He approached the graying guard at the pedestrian entrance and held up the sealed envelope. "I'm from Western Union," he said. "I have a hand delivery for Mr. Ramon Novarro."
The exact score of the game has been long forgotten, but the _1978 Howitzer_ said "the Goat-Engineer game was closer than ever, but the Goats of '78 pulled it out (as usual.) Everyone had a good time, except for those Goats that failed to meet the Engineer cheerleaders." Meanwhile, several Cadets captured Billy XX, the Navy mascot, from the Navy dairy farm and paraded the goat thru the Cadet Mess Hall. The goat was returned safely to Annapolis amid calls for the kitchen staff to clean and prepare it properly for human consumption.
"OK Cheese."

"There is no way 215 groups of people signed up before us," Travis insisted. "That has to be a mistake."
She lost track of who was talking, who was screeching, and who was commanding before a bucket of water sloshed against her back and over her thigh. Sakura did her best to ignore the distraction as she finished the purge, her healing energies now seeking their way into the man, unhindered by the taint of infection.
He would follow me to UT and would be there until I left. I never needed him, and I actually didn't want him. He was more of a burden to me and at the worst possible time, but he was there. He always had an excuse for staying and not returning to El Paso. My duty as son was to not abandon him and I wasn't going to turn him away. For 5 years of being at UT our most frequent conversation over breakfast would be me advising him on finances, or consoling him, telling him that my mom was hating on him for some reason that wasn't his fault. She hated him. But, just to make him forget it and feel a little hope I fed him the BS. It only got worse. One Christmas I drove back home to El Paso immediately after having passed my Calculus Based Physics final - to find my mother bawling. Father had returned home for Christmas early that year and had left a few days ahead of me. Driving into El Paso, I felt so relieved. I had finished my Physics final an hour before everyone else and still did fucking great on it. "I got this shit!" Well, I pulled into our drive way. I noticed that the Christmas lights were up and felt happy. I got out of the car and stepped inside the house; only to find mother bawling. Dad was in the kitchen. I calmed her down enough to ask what was wrong. She told me that dad had left two ropes under her pillow and that he had said he was going to hang her with one, and then hang himself.
She laughs, revealing dimples, and a blush comes her cheeks. As soon as I turn into the cove; we see dolphin fins coming up out of the water.
"Ssh. You'll wake them."
"Yeah. Not easy. What have you got planned?"
Puddle waded right in. The river came up just below his knees. I stood on the bank.

'Of course not,' snapped his friend. 'She wormed it out of me, the little fiend.'
Kat nodded and headed for a serving hatch in the room's rear, her sidearm up just in case. After a moment she stuck her head back through the hatch and said, "Water's turned off, but there's two crates of bottled water. I'll pass them through." As the bottles appeared on the counter, Heimo pointed. For a moment, no one moved, then they surged. For the next few minutes the only sounds were twisting caps, tortured plastic and gurgles.
Chapter Seven Importance of Sports (war on the battlefield)
"Bart, Daron. Can you come down to the studio tonight?"
Most of the men assumed such airs and graces when they spoke to women especially to those younger than them. I wanted to ask him how he had learnt about classical music while looking down on his philistine family. As long as he kept his word I was willing to listen to his inane comments.
Ellie has spent her whole life covering for her irresponsible twin sister, Eve. This time Eve has really done it. After breaking up with yet another boyfriend, Eve talks Ellie into taking over her job while Eve "finds herself" at a yoga camp. How will Ellie keep Eve's boss from finding out what they've done?
"Well, you're wrong. And for the record, I'm 100% behind seeing you left belly up on some foreign balletfield."
But he was done with the conversation, having turned away to button and tuck in his shirt.

24:4 - That's when I heard the most unappetizing slurping sound and across the room and saw the fattest vampire; ever. She was sitting in the corner with her own lacy skirt hem pulled up to expose her very thick and smooth milky-white thighs.
When the old beggar tells Penelope that yes, he saw Odysseus, but that was 20 years, ago, Penelope cries. Why does she cry? If she does not recognize Odysseus, she is crying out of disappointment that the old beggar does not have more recent news of her husband.
She in no way reminded him of a Dickensian character. She was a prim woman in her fifties with neat short hair, severe black glasses and an air of competence unexpected in any friend of Elaine's. He knew this unbidden and unexpected thought was uncharitable and instantly resolved that tomorrow when he was settling accounts with Elaine he would give her two weeks of severance pay, perhaps a month.
Scott reached forward to shake his hand, but James pretended not to notice, so he transitioned into rubbing the back of his own hair. He looked at the walls and then to the back room. The Russian construction worker was glaring at him.
"Go, Tom!" Terry shouted and turned to Dylan for a high-five.
Regina stood before the girl and began to cry. A tear fell down her cheek, though she didn't change her expression.
To say it felt awkward climbing the stairs together was an understatement. The air felt weighted, even though we were both trying to be adult about the situation. I walked into my bedroom first and Dominic followed, lingering by the door. I quickly tidied my bra away that was hanging off the wardrobe door handle and was relieved that I'd changed my bed covers earlier that day. Dominic seemed amused at my frantic tidying and walked in, unbuttoning his shirt.
Walls are blackened, there's a refrigerator
Writers on visual art would be innocents if they believe that silence is a young devil that can be defeated only by heart-felt writing. On the contrary, much more is needed to shake it. Silence is not just a serial killer of artists, it has commanded diabolic armies since a long time ago, and most importantly, it has a plan: victory can only be obtained by destroying the cultural heritage of countries. Serious research and meticulous documentation on the provenance of every artwork is the first line of defence against silence's attacks and its consequences. Results of investigations on the provenance gaps from 1933-1945 (Nazi era) are notable evidences of the damage that silence may cause over extensive territories in a short period of time without being noticed by the art world.
Sarah tugs her back a bit, onto the porch steps. "Give them some space."
Had we been just two people gazing at each other? From the edge of misery, was there yet hope? Could something be salvaged? Could a way be found? Whilst Inch was AFK I thought about it. I tried to visualise all of the possibilities. I tried to piece plans together. I thought to myself, 'maybe Inch can't bear the thought of leaving Step and what that might do to him. That's ok. We could create alts and keep our regular AVs going too. We could lead a double life.' I wanted Inch all to myself, of course, but the opportunity to conduct the very lifestyle right under Step's nose that he himself professed to be an expert in detecting seemed just too good an opportunity to pass up on. I loaded up the Second Life website whilst I waited for Inch's return. I started looking through the current batch of surnames. I decided I liked the look of 'Shostakovich.' Too bad Dimitri was already taken.
I'll take you right back where you started
Robert looks stern. Cassandra likes this.
Joey and I had another exhausting workout. This gave me a good excuse to spend more time in my room with Evelyn due to my apparent fatigue. I entered the room and locked the door. Evelyn was sitting on the bed, and she was obviously very upset. "I can't do this, Adriel! So help me God, if I had a knife on me this morning, I would have plunged it into Joey's heart without hesitation."
Colum turned with an " _I don't know what you are talking about"_ look.
But come again, she never will.
"We're going back to the palace," her father informed her. "I need to make sure my kingdom is still alive. From there, I'll commission search parties to find Augustus. I'll imprison him if I have to, if that's what it takes for him to lift the curse."
Ressmann nodded, looking guilty. "Once I had to stop in a truck park overnight. I got curious, so around three in the morning, I opened her up. The cartons in back was just boxes of paper forms. But the front of the trailer had maybe ten wooden crates. I jimmied one open, and it was full of electronic stuff. Manifest said office supplies and flat-pack furniture."
"You are so full of garbage." He moved to stand, and I instantly tensed, ready for the first blow. "Don't worry about me. We owe you one for your help. You are safe here."

"What happened to the originals?" Lancaster asked.
"Something troubling you, Miss?" Roger asked, startling her. When Rosalind jumped at the sound of his voice, he shook his head and frowned. "You sure are a nervous little thing, aren't you!"
Ruthie, too young to understand politics or law, was old enough to recognize the hurt displayed on her parent's face. She rose from the floor where she had been eating and hugged her father, then her mother. If Matt understood the president's proposals, government goons could come to his door and take Ruthie away. He would never let that happen. Never.

Now, one thing I learned while living in Sanderson County is that you don't mess with John Westly Fergusson. He owned just about everything in the county, even the law. They said he was the nephew of Arthur Fergusson, a mafia boss from northern Atlanta. John Westly had been in prison for murder, bid rigging and running moonshine from Tennessee to Georgia. The Trading Post, they say, was a front for gambling, prostitution, drugs and moonshine. The Fergusson's ran moonshine from the mountains north of Chattanooga, Tennessee and resold it throughout the south. They called it Smokie Mountain Fire. It was crystal clear with sparkling white bubbles. I heard once that they took in runaway girls from big cities, cleaned them up and then put them back out on the street. Arthur's daddy had come to Atlanta from Chicago after the depression. His daddy was pressured out of Chicago by the police and FBI. Later on his daddy was sent to prison for life, where he died, and Arthur took over the family business. They ran and owned most of northern Georgia from north of Atlanta to the Tennessee state line.
"They aren't strong, they are fat," Carmen muttered.
Terry arrived at the hospital in full clerical dress. He was always amazed at the nearly unlimited access his priestly uniform afforded him in such places. As long as he was wearing his priest's collar, no one questioned him, no one stopped him, and nearly everyone gave him a deferential nod whenever he caught their eye. Only occasionally did someone look close enough to notice his earrings, and he always enjoyed the double take that precipitated.
Marcus felt a convenient sweat break out across his forehead and he made a big play of wiping it away. "I'm already an hour late. I gotta get —"

Joey began, "I don't usually know when I have offended someone. You have told me Evelyn has been offended by me, and I have seen her get upset. I suppose that any offense I have caused her should be mended."
He jigged over to Bart and said something in his ear. I couldn't hear what, but I saw Bart shrug. The stranger pointed to the amp on the ground and said something more, a wicked smile on his face, and Bart looked bemused. Bart shared a look with me then and started the chorus again.
"Very well. I need a car and I thought of you straight away."
That would be bad news. Sim did not appear immediately as he usually did, so Hartle assumed he was in the doghouse yet. That suited him just fine. A guy could only do so much. He could only take so much.
Masozi looked at the menu and hardly knew where to begin. It was filled with delicacies which made the Casa Mia pasta she had shared with Jericho and Benton seem like street-side takeout by comparison. She actually had to double-take at several of the listed items before shaking her head. "I wouldn't know where to begin," she admitted before handing the menu back to the woman.
"Ballet."
Then I hear his doorbell ring and he goes inside.
"I want precise strikes against that destroyer's engines, Tactical," Captain Charles instructed as he steepled his fingers before his face while his eyes snapped back and forth between the multiple tactical readouts flanking the main viewer, which was now filled with a magnified image of what Masozi assumed was the _Kathryn Janeway_. The image on the screen adjusted its heading until it was driving directly toward the view screen's pickup.
"That used to be my name, but it was legally changed to Nicholas Keller six years ago, so you may call me Nicholas or Mr. Keller if you'd like."
The two friends had made Giselle's bedroom a serene and beautiful haven. They'd washed the existing bedspread, but sewed up some bright and beautiful new throw pillows to throw across that vicinity to perk up the room, but also to give Giselle plenty of comfort. Awsty had brought enough of one of the fabrics used for the pillows to quickly sew up some new curtains to put at the one-and-only bedroom window. Granted, that window looked out on the parking garage, but they were hoping they could camouflage that fact by hanging the curtains from halfway down the window and closing them, so that it would give Giselle privacy, but she could still look out the upper half of the window to see sky and trees.
In light of all that we have learned so far, and in light of the original prophecy, it is simply not credible or possible that Daniel meant that Jerusalem lay devastated without an inhabitant for seventy years following Jerusalem's destruction. It could not have.
Vienna ran to the window, flung it open and then paused. It was a ludicrously long way down. The fall would surely kill her. Was this really a choice between life and death?
I drained my drink and stood, Nickolai's eyes never leaving me as I gathered my stuff and just left him sitting there.
_G: Pops says they're arriving in 20?_
Nodding, she says, "I think so. I _hope_ so." She gnaws on her bottom lip.
"Just this way, sir," one of the women said as she jammed a thumb backward toward a tall building behind them.

Keep this in mind when deciding whether to enter into an agreement with a FSBO seller without agent or attorney representation. If you are equally as confused about these two critical elements of the home purchase, your best bet is to either pay for your own representation or find another FSBO home with a seller who is willing to pay for these services for you.
Regina grabbed Dawn by the shoulders and spun her back around to the front, casting an apologetic look at the lady behind her just as the crowd exploded into another scream. Dawn and Regina looked up to see what had happened, but they'd missed the action.
49:37 - "I don't just mean out of this car. I want completely out of this lair!"
"For what?" asked Diana.
"Ahh, come on. You're not scared, are you?"
Zane steps closer, too close for comfort.
'Fucking shut up,' she says. I can't decide if she will hurl over the table, or hurl herself over the table at me.

"I don't see any reason to postpone the search," he says.
"Well, I'm not trying to get you into any tonight. I'm going to take care of myself and I want you to watch me. I'd love it if you did the same." Leon's hand worked that slim cock, and Nick stroked himself one handed and stretched the other out to Leon, hoping that he'd like to hold hands while they did this. "Yeah, babe, that's fine. We can do that."
*PROMETHEUS
He watched Aron's loping hands out of the corner of his eye but they didn't tell him much. He switched with Aron, just briefly, and felt a satisfied fear in his friend—a copacetic unease. But Ravno also sensed muted excitement, though he may have constructed that from his own imagination.
I attract to me only those who have attained this sacred balance.
"Touch them," he repeats, smirking lustfully.
Billy Wilkerson introduced her to his reporters like she was the prodigal daughter, then delivered her to an alcove on the eastern side of the building. It wasn't quite an office, but it was separate enough from the reporting floor's clattering typewriters, jangling telephones and thick smoky haze. He pulled her chair out for her. "I had this reupholstered for you." Kathryn could smell the fresh leather. "You'll need a quiet corner in which to gather your gossip."
"Looks like the media finally uncovered some skeletons in Senator Sherbrooke's closet," she heard the laptop's owner say to his friend. "According to this article, he has an illegitimate daughter floating around."

The herbalist handed Erynn the small package of tea, and she forgot all about the two strange men and turned for the road. But she hadn't gone more than a few steps when she felt a tug on her arm.
"I don't ever see you again?" A trace of belligerence shaded his voice but it was forced.
"Fine," Dizzy said as he reluctantly threw back his covers and sat up to face his sister.

"Hello, Madam Nifemi. You just said what? What happened to Sergeant?" Her husband asked the woman on the other end.
Her eyes squinted behind her glasses. "I don't know... I wouldn't daresay a book that just fell off the shelf in the library could possibly be anything but. Yet, a reproduction of what?"
"I really—" Grace said, obviously about to say she really didn't want a man like Jarrak indebted to her.
The Monastero Santa Margherita perched on a rocky clifftop somewhere between the pretty villages of Positano and Amalfi. The winding road that led there, with its sharp hairpin bends, made Liv slightly dizzy but the view from the car window told her that it would all be worth it once they got to the top. The road steadily climbed the huge craggy hill over the bay of Salerno, skirting past steep terraced gardens with neat vegetable patches and tidy rows of lemon trees. Liv wondered how the hell people managed to get up to their allotments on such a sheer cliff face let alone drag up spades and bags of compost. Saint Margherita, Liv thought, must have been closely related to a mountain goat.
"Thank you, my friend," came the sarcastic retort. "I just wish I could figure out what they are planning."
"Tanzania?!" Evelyn was now wide awake. "Where are my clothes?" Evelyn was looking left and right in the seat of the limousine.

This time Sam held on tightly with both hands and crept carefully from the edge towards the safety of the Rollagon. As he approached the AI backed slowly away. "This is unsafe."
Mike Hargis kicked off to the Crusaders three-yard line and Holy Cross returned it 28 yards (Hargis). Holy Cross opened in a Wishbone offense. On first down (H31), a pitch play went around the right end for seven yards (D'Amico). Another pitch play lost two yards around the left end as the runner fumbled the ball, but recovered it (Hilliard, Fuller). Holy Cross ran around the right end for no gain (Smith). On fourth down, the Crusaders punted 49 yards where it rolled dead at 10:29.
Jinks frowned as he walked into the room to pay attention to Leader Lave's orders he figured to himself "I might as well see if I can help him out."
"So you're actually admitting it? I knew you loved me," he said cockily but I could tell from the emotion in his eyes just how much it meant to hear the words. Before I could say anything else, he picked me up in his arms. I squealed in surprise and held on to his neck as he lifted me like a bride being carried to her honeymoon suite.

There was renewed movement in the nest and Darsey finally looked around to see crew from every shift surging from the link and jostling to claim consoles. Jileea seemed to be ignoring them, with her gaze fixed on a gold circle floating toward her. The bracelet opened like a hungry mouth, then lunged for her wrist to snap tight. Jileea arched back in response, before settling deeper into the leader's seat. She lifted a hand to beckon the nearest crewmember and the others began to queue before her.
"You're welcome," Susan said. She removed her glasses and smiled at Kat with real feeling and sincerity. "It's part of what we are called to do, you know? We were all strangers once, and God makes of us a family. Hospitality is part of religious life. The guys here would hardly be good friars if they didn't welcome the stranger as if he or she were Jesus himself." She stretched. "My eyes are getting crossed, staring at that screen. I need a break. How's about we get some tea?"
The station was dizzy with people. A large board hung in the center of the second floor with names written down one column and case numbers along the top row. Red and black were the standard colors throughout the board to signify the status of the case. Everyone hated the sight of red on the board, hence the flutter of movement throughout the halls. The detective bureau held tight to the second floor of the Rath Building; most of the other departments were located on the first and third with administrative, and higher political offices took up the top three floors. Loren was sure everyone that could be in the building at that moment was located on the second floor.
"Why didn't I listen when they said to bring the extra submachine gun?" she came close, and saw the dark wooden door. She saw few footsteps marked around the door. Sharine smiled shrewdly.
Darsey had always been a loner, but abruptly realized that she had never been truly alone before. Even on solo shift, far from the sun's warmth, she had always known that she could and would return to her own species. That home was simply a flight away. She looked into this alien's hawk-like eyes and understood that this time there was no easy return. Perhaps no return at all.
"He passed out again." Josh climbed onto the seat and shined the flashlight toward the pilot's feet. The left shin, wedged between the side of the cabin and the rudder pedal, looked bent.
It was amazing to me that this totally studious and scientific woman could suddenly become so personable.

Pat's expression didn't change but the words felt like the first stab of Caesar's men. Hurt and anger swirled in him. He felt chastised, but more than that, he felt deserted by those who once promised to be his defenders and friends forever.
"But you said I should guide Tok and L."
"How do you like our transport over there?"
When he came to her room, she either asked any attending nurse to please close the door before he entered, or she would simply turn over in bed and lie in the opposite direction with her eyes closed, refusing to acknowledge his presence.
_"_ Here, _"_ Jamie said, stalking behind Allison's chair and trying to poke the nipple of a bottle into Samantha's pulsing mouth. _"_ Maybe she's hungry. _"_
"Hey, baby girl. I've missed you."
The lieutenant nodded.
It was an understandably awkward position to be in. How much of this would Brendan pass on in subsequent conversations? It always comes back to you, doesn't it? Teasing Sim was getting to be a bad habit, but it would do well to keep Sim and Trent and all the others guessing. Especially the Princess. It might be best to ignore her for a while. Not much of a plan, but it was better than nothing. To forget about her would be the best thing, but clearly that was impossible in the short term.
"Everything okay?" Laura asks, frowning with concern.
C. Smile sweetly and act supportive because now you can eat all the fried foods that she won't let you have when she's at home.
"That is not for me to answer. I only came to wake you up for a second. You may choose to go back to floating."
I let my mouth drop open. As soon as my computer was up and running I'd have to email Sean. He'd fix this. He'd back me up. Carl tolerated Sean. His word meant more than mine.
Hartle pointed his ship in the direction of the centre of the system and the planet in question, knowing it was a gamble.
"I thought you were just another—."
"You need to know something," Heimo said after a while. "In the past nine months my life has turned into something that I literally never could have imagined. Out of nowhere, I have you, I have a family I didn't know about, I have a family that was almost lost to me, and my old directions disappeared. I've been a bit punch-drunk most of the time."
An UMass pass attempt was knocked down by Chuck D'Amico, but Army was penalized half the distance to the goal for roughing the passer. On first down (A08), a pass attempt was broken up by Joe LeGasse. Another pass attempt was defended by Dave Charest and incomplete. The Minutemen went up the middle for no gain (Fuller). On fourth down, Massachusetts' Croasdale converted a 25-yard field goal at 6:59. The scoring drive of ten plays for 51 yards led to a 20-10 score.
The smell of the leaves and the loam of the dirt beneath them wafted up into his nostrils, a fresh wild smell that invigorated him. He wiped his brow.
"Uh, okay. If you're sure." While she appreciated the offer, she already felt as if she was taking advantage of the situation by accepting his invitation to hide out there.
"Yeah, that'll be fine," I say, accepting the proffered key and placing my credit card on the counter.
That was wonderful. I am the voyeur to your defeat. If only your pain was mine.
"See you later," he says, heading for the door.
24. José Martí. Nude in the salon. The Hour. New York, July 31st, 1880.
"Yeah."
C. So we can take over the countries that have oil so we can keep driving our gas guzzling American-made trucks.
"This is our right," the driver said harshly, silencing the boy. "This is what the shifters have a right to do to our women who run free."
"We're all villagers here, but every one of us comes from the camps, " began Alba. "All of us were taken by the Clacamash when we were children and made to work in the mines."
"Where do you live normally then?"
She stretched up and kissed him on the lips. He held her gaze for a moment and then wrapped his arms gently around her, pulling her close. Her body felt good to him. It was like a dam broke in him and he kissed her back passionately.
As we turned, I said, "Do you want to hear something funny?"
"Hang on, babe. It's going to get a bit bumpier. But don't worry, no one needs to know you're there."
"No, I'm moving in with my girlfriend, Michelle."
"Oh! Oh, now I see..." she stammered self-consciously, adding, "My goodness, I had no idea..."
"It was a time of war!" Fremont said leaping to his friend's defense.
"Go ahead. I'll be right back."

"After Nick rescues your soldiers, we're going to take you down to campus health services and get you an appointment to talk to somebody. That was one nasty-ass way to break up with someone. He can't have been much of a prize as a boyfriend."
"Novelist? Playwright?"
A double-hung door, barely three feet from my elbow, swung abruptly toward me. Eliot emerged, carrying a lacquer serving tray on which he'd arranged silver bowls of potato chips and nuts. As he walked, he stared at the bowls as if daring them to spill their contents.
"I just have to stop by my place; I'm at the YMCA, at the end of the road."
"I've got things under control," Dr. Worthen said.

Agencja podróży była jeszcze otwarta. Ten sam agent, który sprzedał mi bilet na corridę siedział za biurkiem. Powiedział że do Tulum jest niedaleko ale trzeba wynająć samochód. I że jeżeli już jadę w tamtą stronę, to żebym zabrał ze sobą sprzęt do "snorklingu", bo tam niedaleko są wspaniałe zatoczki do nurkowania. On może mi wynająć Volkswagena garbusa już dzisiaj, rano wsiadam w pojazd i w drogę. Zgodziłem się. Podczas gdy agent wypełniał papiery, ja oglądałem kolorowe broszury na półkach. Wpadł mi w oko cienki album, na okładce widniało zdjęcie dużej budowli z kamienia w kształcie schodkowej piramidy a powyżej napisane było "TULUM". Zakupiłem ten album, mapę samochodową półwyspu Jukatan i z kluczykami od auta w kieszeni wyszedłem z agencji. Na parkingu stały dwa nowiutkie Volkswageny garbusy, biały i czerwony. Ten czerwony czekał już teraz na mnie. Pogładziłem ręką lśniący lakier na dachu, mocno mnie korciło żeby usiąść za kierownicę i przejechać się kawałek, ale zrezygnowałem. Piłem niedawno wino, jeszcze czułem przyjemny szum w głowie, a nie miałem pojęcia na ile tutejsza policja tolerancyjna jest wobec kierowców po alkoholu, wolałem nie sprawdzać na własnej skórze.
First Fruits (Yom Habikkurim) — And the LORD spoke unto Moses saying: Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them: When ye are come into the land which I give unto you, and shall reap the harvest thereof, then ye shall bring the sheaf of the first-fruits of your harvest unto the priest. And he shall wave the sheaf before the LORD, to be accepted for you; on the morrow after the Sabbath the priest shall wave it.
"How exciting to be able to experience a forest Festival," I added. "What an honor."

Not wanting to appear like a fool before this heavenly creature, I quickly fall back on procedure and ask her, "Can I get your name, address, and a number where you can be reached?"
"What did he say?"
All of the dead had been drained of blood.
\--"I like your ideas Madam President. But in my country the medical costs increase throughout life and through retirement. Doctors' fees are up, hospital costs are up, prescription drugs costs are up."
Usher dates the seventy years desolation eighteen years earlier than shown above—i.e., before the dethronement of Zedekiah, Judah's last king—because the king of Babylon took many of the people captive at that time. (2 Chron. 36:9, 10, 17, 21; 2 Kings 24:8-16.) He evidently makes the not uncommon mistake of regarding those seventy years as the period of captivity, whereas the Lord expressly declares them to be seventy years of desolation of the land, that the land should lie "desolate, without an inhabitant." Such was not the case prior to Zedekiah's dethronement. (2 Kings 24:14.) But the desolation which followed Zedekiah's overthrow was complete; for, though some of the poor of the land were left to be vine-dressers and husbandmen (2 Kings 25:12), shortly even these—"all people, both small and great"—fled to Egypt for fear of the Chaldees. (Verse 26.) There can be no doubt here; and therefore in reckoning the time to the desolation of the land, all periods up to the close of Zedekiah's reign should be counted in, as we have done.
39:7 - The forest rats were so much smaller than the nutria but their little eyes were just as adorable and black. I marveled to think how they seemed to plead: "What's my mission?" while gazing up at me.
So I took a walk around Homicide as ordered.

If you're hard to convince, remember the day you drank nothing all day until you were overwhelmed by thirst and the water was so good the lack of taste was momentarily forgotten. The water quenched your throat and the cooling sensation of water relieved your entire body from head-to-toe. And although most of the time the vibrate feeling can't be felt, just know replenishing the body with water does a body good. And this explains why water is a great wonder of our world!

The locals and were amassing in droves for this was a special event. Barn dances were rarely, if ever, held during the winter and no sane person from Brannaska was going to miss the dance or the great band that's for sure.
Ach, cóż to był za dzień. Siedziałem w podcieniu tarasu popijając wzmocnioną kawę, od strony basenu dochodziły aż tutaj dźwięki samby a na jednej z czterech ogromnych palm królewskich przed głównym wejściem siedział dzięcioł (one nawet tutaj mają czerwone berety) i stukał zawzięcie.

Just couldn't resist, apparently. He studied the results, documents sent over from Federal Police Headquarters. Clive sat there with him in his office, ashen-faced but strangely unrepentant.
Adena seemed to realize what she was thinking because she tugged on her arm. "It's too risky, Erynn."

And here we discover what creative writing means to me and my interest in the course you offer.
When I got back with the coffee, Betty met me with a loving smile, a vision of loveliness indeed for these tired eyes. You could tell she was worried about me, thinking I was wearing myself out, but we all were overworked on this case and a vacation was probably on the minds of each and every one of us.
"I guess as a werebear you wouldn't really have to worry about getting too cold, huh?" I asked.
Cooper, p 98.
"You could try to understand me, just a little." She watched him take a seat beside her, not too close. "After all, I came all this way to find you."
"But, he isn't allowed to eat or drink before his — "
"Hello, Madam Nifemi. You just said what? What happened to Sergeant?" Her husband asked the woman on the other end.
"Thank you." She sits down across the table from me. "I could tell from your expression today that you didn't know my son was an author."
We assume that physical processes are solely driven by information use.
He crawled back onto the bottom bunk and lay down his head. Shifting slightly, he next reached around under his back and pulled Esau's short story out from where it had become twisted in the bedclothes.
A lot of years had passed. Maybe Levi had been having tons of sex with guys during that time. Maybe this was really no big deal for him. "Have you ever—"
"Sure, but you have to do all the songs," Dizzy replied. He knew Ana's favorite part was getting to sing the songs, and since he wasn't going to let down his "too cool for Disney" persona, he wouldn't be caught dead singing "I Just Can't Wait to Be King."
The closest that British actress Julie Walters has ever come to dying is during a trip to Corfu. She swam out to a rock, but while she was swimming a storm sprang up and made the water choppy and difficult to swim in. She arrived at the rock so exhausted that she couldn't climb out of the water. Fortunately, a man saw her and pulled her up on the rock so she could rest and breathe. By the way, Ms. Walters tells this joke: "An elephant met a mouse in the jungle and the mouse said, 'Bloody hell, you're absolutely enormous.' And the elephant said, 'Well, you're really, really little.' And the mouse said, 'Yes, but I haven't been well.'" (128)
"How did _that_ happen?" I asked. Christa's relationship with her mother was, if nothing else, fraught. Almost since the day I'd met Christa, she'd been vowing to cut all ties. Routinely she referred to her mother as "the shrewish harpy" or "the raging bitch."
I am speaking now with some wonder, and astonishment, of the clothing Moody Santo, the hero of this story, was found in after his death. A detailed analysis of the clothing revealed that the fibers it was made of were neither natural nor manufactured. In short, they could not have been said conclusively to have come from or been made on Earth. This fact presented the major stumbling block to my simply dismissing this entire tale as either simply science fiction or an elaborate hoax. I have seen the fiber analysis with my own eyes.
Annabelle and Victoria's blood pressure was low, yet their brain activity was high and erratic. While Katherine's blood pressure was high and her brain activity was almost completely gone, as if she were brain dead. It was if they were asleep and dreaming, but there was no rapid eye movement. None of the doctors could explain it. Dr. Cline thought it would be best if they put off telling the parents for a few days of the complications of the catatonic sleep and the third girl, in hopes that they would soon awake.
I stood there with the package in my hand, and watched her silhouette turn distant and small, and finally disappear behind a group of trees. I suddenly realized it was bitterly cold, and I shivered in the white loneliness of the sad winter.

Matters came to a head when I was told that the prospective groom's family were coming the next day to visit us. My parents considered it a good match. Their approval would put the final stamp on the proposal.

"Damn, is there anything that eye can't do?"
His lighter sparked and he inhaled the sweet smoke into his lungs. The girl looked at him, by now the water had only risen a foot deep again. As it splashed in, he realized that with wet hands she would probably get the joint wet. Kneeling beside the bath, he offered her a hit. Her lips, red like raspberry wine, parted and he saw the way the muscles moved over the bones when she inhaled. She was such a skinny kid. It was scary. She seemed to like it, took another and waved him off.
I spent about a year in the Marshall Islands, teaching children at a mission school. I loved it there, but I was forced to leave by the board of directors after an infection in my foot almost cost me my life. My best friend, Janet, had died just weeks earlier in a shipwreck. Both experiences caused me a lot of emotional pain.
A smile came to his eyes, and I could see how different it was from the one he had held on his lips.
The fridge door was wide open. On the floor lay the broken plate Momma threw earlier. He stepped over the ceramic, making sure not cut himself and heard a buzz. He turned and saw the fly from earlier trekking across the floor. Brody chuckled and knelt. The fly had no wings left, but it kept buzzing as if it had them. He leaned close enough to kiss it; he wanted to see if the fly had any hair on its head. "You look hurt." He pinned the fly down with his finger. "Where you running to, friend?" The fly stopped moving. Was it dead? He released his finger. The fly's tiny legs jumped into overdrive and pushed itself forward. "Knew you weren't dead."
Flack's fast beating heart suddenly beat faster as the human came into view. The human was approaching the dog, and seemingly, looking directly at Flack but, obviously due to the thickness of the bushes around him and the darkness caused by the leaves obscuring the sun from above, the human found it harder to see into the thicket than it was for Flack to see out of.
Rosalind's eyebrows arched. "Then you have decided to stow away aboard the _Conway_?"

"We are so fucked," Orel said.
The reader may or not be surprised ... that the Hebrew word Torah comes from the Hebrew root word yarah. Yarah means "to throw, to shoot (as an arrow for example), to aim at." Yarah then is the directional process taken by a propelled object aimed at a particular target or end point. Yarah certainly implies: a shooter, a starting point, a traveling process, and an ending point. As a derivative of the word yarah ... Torah in a Hebraic understanding means much more than a "legal code" or set of rules. Torah implies a starting point, a progression in a specific direction, and a final ending point.
"It seems I'm the only one who is attempting to prevent you from continuing to behave like a hoyden."
Adam studied her face, desperately wishing he could find the right words to make her stay. "You are certain this is what you want?" was all he managed.
On the drive home, my mind felt overwhelmed with questions. I thought about my past, the present, and future. Unknown questions worried me but at the same time fueled my excitement. Chance and I drove into the night and I enjoyed the time we shared. We laughed and joked with one another and reminisced about the back in the day, days. Time flew, and it seemed like none had passed when we arrived home.
Verse 1:
Army opened the scoring against Washington State early in the second quarter with a five yard touchdown run on a 47-yard nine play drive due to a nifty 18-yard punt return by Phil Macklin. Heisman Trophy candidate Jack Thompson then led the Cougars to three straight touchdowns and a 7-21 halftime lead.
"And just where have you been sleeping?" Nickolai asked in a tone that demanded I answer him.

The roller made it a few meters across the flat surface, and behind it the sand was being shaped into patterns. Lancaster continued to twist the crank, and the roller continued across the surface. He didn't look back until he had made it all the way to the end, at which point the roller had come full circle.
"Yes," I said. "I have reached that point. I need change."
I had no idea what a group of alternative means meant, but I understood brigands.

Remaining motionless, with his eyes closed but his ears searching for sounds, he allowed the sun's rays to seep into him and recharge him, giving him newfound strength.

Any rational person can easily see that irreligion prevails wherever there is wickedness. Reasonable Muslims who abide by the Koran and have faith in God would never hold Christians responsible for the killings in question. This is not something that a person who sincerely believes in God could ever do.
The cage that the guards had thrown Charles in was nearly a perfect cube. Perfect in the sense that all the edges were the same size; in all other ways the accommodations were far from ideal. The four walls, roof, and floor were all made of thick bars spaced two inches apart. It was suspended on the edge of a cliff so the open sea was directly below Charles. The only bedding that was provided was some hay, much of which had fallen between the bars. Otherwise, Charles was directly exposed to all of the elements.
The hurg changed his course, attempting to cut him off. To keep him from doing so, Lawrence hurled a small fireball in his opponent's direction.

Then Regina reached into her briefcase again and pulled out two more prints, one for the host and the other one to show on camera for the audience. The photograph showed a woman with broad shoulders, breasts, and small hips, but with a penis and scrotum in her crotch.

Kolay'sha's mind was upon the thought of young dragons being so involved using DragonBreath upon each other and not seeing any dangers until it was too late.

There were three exit doors. The one nearest to her, which must lead to the library. The one through which she had come and Gosse had entered behind her. A third that joined this to the chambers at the front of the house. The man could put a bullet through her before she could hope to reach any one of them. Eh bien, she must use her tongue against him.
They were backed up by a second wave of human-driven ships which finished off the satellites. The Koneraad losses were minimal, and no living crew or soldiers were yet lost. This was going even easier than expected. Once they had boots on the ground upon the planet, the surviving ships would be able to rain down support bombardment from above; that is, should the fight be far enough away from the fort so they would not destroy the target they hoped to capture.
"Is there any way of getting there by boat?" Daniel asked her.
"We're friars, not monks. And this is Berkeley," Richard said. "Our sex lives are tame by comparison to most of the people in here."
"But your memory hasn't come back, has it?"
"My number will be at the bottom of your release form. I won't be on tomorrow to see you out. Eleven days in a row with three double shifts thrown in for good measure are about all I can handle. Tomorrow, Robert and I are going shopping, probably get him those new bearings he's been harping on for his skate board, and then the day after, I'll be right back here, picking up as though I've never left," she says nonchalantly, not looking for nor expecting any sympathy, just stating it as it is in her chirpy, upbeat way.
The thought of human monsters bolstered his speed a little, and he knew that it important that he kept his pace up until he was at least lost amongst the rocky hills and slopes. In the desert, it would be easy for him to be seen and tracked, but the rocks and slopes that he was heading toward gave him, and his wife, some protection from the prying eyes of the dreaded humans.
Martin approaches and I take the camera from him as he leans forward, panting. I fumble my way through turning it on and I take a photo of the pink flowers. I will ask Gus at the garden centre what it is and whether it would survive a Yorkshire winter.

Ana was now crying. Dizzy bent down and was face to face with her.
Many thanks, and a happy new year to you and yours.
I was starting to feel better and made a note to pack some lunch tomorrow. Obviously, the chocolate was not enough.

Forty-five minutes later Hart was greeting the Marquess of Preston and his goddaughter in the receiving line at Preston's home in fashionable Mayfair. He pasted on a smile for the sake of the lady and hoped he didn't look as bored as he knew he was about to feel.

"The night Jonathan died," she began, her voice but a hoarse whisper, "sleep eluded me because I was so distressed about all that had occurred. The heat of the night also was unbearable, so I finally left my chamber and went down to the kitchen for some cider, thinking it might help calm me. When I entered, I heard a noise behind me. It was...the savage...lurking in the shadows. Before I even could comprehend who he was or why he was there, he grabbed me and put one of Grace's carving knives to my throat, warning me not to make a sound."
He laughed. "It'll be fine. Honest. They're great people and won't do anything to make you uncomfortable."
"CLASS," THE FEMALE professor at Regina's old university said loudly enough to be heard. "This is Dr. Isler, professor emeritus in psych right here at this university, who is here today to give you a presentation she calls 'The Transgender Paradigm.'" The students murmured; some liked the topic, and some didn't. "I know, I know. You've all heard it before, but Dr. Isler used to be a west-coast leader with some standing in the movement, and she may have something of significance to share." Then to set the tone, she added, "Give her your full attention."
"No. I missed you." I hugged her again, and then we stood momentarily confused. I wanted to talk with her alone, but it was polite to say at least a few words to father Jacques, and maybe some others. In the end, Elise handled it well. She took my hand and went to say hello to Father Jacques, and then she went with the two of us to be introduced by the Father to most of the other people in the room. Two or three eons passed while we met every person and heard how each knew some person in government or had met some other DuPry. Elise kept sliding her hand back into mine, and I practiced patience. Eventually she had spoken with everyone, hugged Father Jacques (I wasn't sure you could do that, but he didn't seem to mind), and she led me outside.
"What do you think of our king, Nik?" Enriki asked.
"Beautiful, isn't it?" the man who had invited her into the lift said after nearly a minute of Masozi's silent gaping at the awe-inspiring sight. "The station is currently at its northern zenith relative to the ring-plane—this is the best view we'll get for the next two months until we pass to the southern zenith. Please, the Director is waiting," he gestured toward a nearby staircase, which led up to a platform in the center of the chamber, before proceeding to climb those stairs himself.

"Is that why you ordered the nine-ounce filet instead of the seven-ounce?"
Today women consistently tempt to compare themselves to a man on a daily basis, so the respect for them has been reduced. A woman can be truly defined when one knows what it means to be a lady versus being a man in today's society. But those experiences of women observing the actions of a man may have influenced their decision to imitate men. Although the facts are that normally a man's mental capacity gives him the edge. Nevertheless the status of men and women must be examined.
It was still unbearably hot outside and the crowd seemed to be thinning as the noon hour ended and folks went back to work, or maybe just got bored and went home. I listened to the current speaker who was earnest enough, but really had nothing fresh to say, and had no special magic in his words. He might have been a college professor speaking to bored students. If this was the main event to unite all Louisiana, it was not going all that well.
When Flack heard a rustling sound he turned and saw the figure of Brand vanishing amongst the leaves of the bushes that surrounded them.

Tintinnabulation (I) is the sound of ringing bells. As a child I grew up in Monmouthshire (now Gwent) and not so far away from Tintern Abbey. A favorite haunt of the classic writer William Wordsworth (RCHS: 2017). Wordsworth penned his poem, 'On Revisiting the Banks of The Wye during a Tour (July 13, 1798)' from the hillside above the abbey, but of focus here is the mnemonic of associating Tintern Abbey with bell towers. Tintin (Tintern) & nabulation (Abbey). It's just a phonic-phrase that works for me and always has. Since first discovering the word Tintinnabulation during my music technology diploma many years ago, the association has never failed me. Forget trying to remember the spelling, Google can do that, but I highly recommend this system as personalized ( I can remember the word I seek now but yet again my spelling of mnenphonic appears in angry red to suggest I use monophonic, so again I re-scroll up the text) mnemonic as an memory aid to dyslexics. Yes; my memory and difficulty is really that bad.

Ben Simpson sat at his bedroom window. It was 11.00pm. He was taking a break after three hours of Warhammer. He was surveying the street and the houses opposite with a pair of night vision binoculars. It was amazing what you could see in an ordinary street and in ordinary houses if you were patient enough. At the moment nothing was happening but that was all right. The night was young. There was a bright quarter moon and you could see quite well without the binos. The binos were for close-ups. Ben looked at the Mannings' house opposite. Nothing much happened there. Their car was parked outside so that they were probably in. Ben had once hoped that Mrs Manning would provide material for upload to milfwatch.com, but had so far been disappointed. The Mannings might even have gone to bed, preparing for a long day in the bank or wherever they worked. The place was very quiet. Ben had a look through the binos at the ground floor. Nothing. He had another look at the bedroom curtains. Nothing. But wait a minute – what was that? He thought he saw something move in the path that went up the side of the house and into the garden. Something small, dark and furry. Maybe a squirrel or a small dog, or a cat. But who knows it could be something more exotic. Maybe a mink.

However, before joining we had to get medically evaluated. I have a heart condition, WPW, Wolf-Parkinson-White Syndrome. It's an extra piece of nerve tissue running between the chambers of my heart and distracts the electrical flow. It can cause palpitations and at worse sudden death. I decided not to lie about it fearing it would bite me in the ass bigtime later on. I couldn't see failure as an option especially with the physical shape I was in. What heart condition? I completed the medical evaluation and was asked to wait to hear back. I was so fucking excited.

He was the first of Gama's captains to reach Mozambique, and establish contact with the sultan of Quiloa. He was also the first of Gama's armada to arrive in Lisbon, on 10 July 1499 where King Manuel I of Portugal bestowed to him a pension of 50,000 reis per year, 30,000 in interest for his lands and his descendants and a new coat of arms. He was made Knight of the Royal House (Cavaleiro da Casa Real) that same year.

The inks used in digital printing on glass mimic the CMYK color model and are made of ceramic frit and inorganic pigments and elements. The development of inks is a highly controlled production process to remove any variability in the final product. The consistency in a replication of the inks results in high compatibility with the entire color palette of inks. The inks can therefore be digitally mixed and designers will know the precise outcome of the color every time. Printed glass panels can also be replaced when necessary without the risk of the new panels not matching the colors of the existing panels. The inks are also fully integrated with the machine and the image processing software meaning the development and the application of the inks required innovations both in science and technology.

There has been no commonly-used definition of the term "abstract photography". Books and articles on the subject include everything from a completely representational image of an abstract subject matter, such as Aaron Siskind's photographs of peeling paint, to entirely non-representational imagery created without a camera or film, such as Marco Breuer's fabricated prints and books. The term is both inclusive of a wide range of visual representations and explicit in its categorization of a type of photography that is visibly ambiguous by its very nature.

The PS/2 port is a 6-pin mini-DIN connector used for connecting keyboards and mice to a PC compatible computer system. Its name comes from the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older DE-9 RS-232 "serial mouse" connector, while the PS/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pin/180° DIN connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. The PS/2 keyboard port is electrically and logically identical to the IBM AT keyboard port, differing only in the type of electrical connector used. The PS/2 platform introduced a second port with the same design as the keyboard port for use to connect a mouse; thus the PS/2-style keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike the otherwise similar Apple Desktop Bus connector used by Apple, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may not be interchangeable since the two devices use different sets of commands and the device drivers generally are hard-coded to communicate with each device at the address of the port that is conventionally assigned to that device. (That is, keyboard drivers are written to use the first port, and mouse drivers are written to use the second port.)

Since the 1955 renumbering, the route of LA 14 has generally remained the same. Improvements to the route began with a minor re-alignment bypassing Rossignol in Calcasieu Parish around 1959. In 1963, the western terminus in Lake Charles was moved several blocks north from Broad Street to Fruge Street when US 90 was moved onto I-10 through the downtown area. Around 1964, the route southeast of the Mermentau River bridge at Lake Arthur was smoothed out. In about 1966, the four-lane bypass of Abbeville was opened, allowing truck and other through traffic to avoid having to navigate around both the Magdalen and Courthouse Squares as well as a narrow lift bridge across the Vermilion River. Around 1990, the portion of LA 14 between Delcambre and New Iberia was widened to four lanes. The portion of the route through Lake Charles followed soon afterward.<ref name="DOTD 1991/92"></ref> In the late 1990s, the route between Abbeville and Delcambre was four-laned, necessitating a bypass of the main road through Erath. The original alignment has since been retained as a business route.

the Ion rapid transit. The first phase would run from Conestoga Mall in the north of Waterloo, to Fairview Park Mall in the south of Kitchener, while the second phase of the line would run from Fairview Mall to the Galt area of Cambridge. Mayor Doug Craig was a determined opponent of the plan, arguing that an expanded express bus system would be just as effective but much less expensive. By late February 2017, the Kitchener-Waterloo portion was well into the final phase of construction, but plans for the Cambridge section of the LRT were still in the very early stage. Public consultations were just getting started at the time. Three routes had been agreed on in 2011, with eight "endorsed" stops: at Fairway, Sportsworld, Preston, Pinebush, Cambridge Centre Mall, Can-Amera, Delta and Ainslie Street Terminal. Three others were still being considered.

Ferns, mushrooms and other plants which require tree cover and a lot of humus started appearing after just a few years in the forest. At first only a few species were found flourishing but more species are now appearing, some on branches, trunks of dead wood and on the rock cliff faces. Leaf shedding ants are useful in cutting leaves into small pieces. The ants work day and night. Their leaf shredding habit and their fungal cultivation are beneficial to the forest. These types of ants are many, an example being the weaver ants. The termites are also in large numbers in our forest. The termites feed on soft timber trunks, thus they are usually considered as pests, but they play a great role in reducing the dead wood in forests to humus.

On rare occasions, "Colpoda" have been observed to divide into 4 individuals without producing a cyst wall. It has been suggested that cystless reproduction was the normal mode of reproduction for "Colpoda" under optimum conditions and that the formation of cysts was a reaction to adverse environmental conditions. However, the knowledge gained by many years of culturing "Colpoda" in hay infusions has shown that this mode of reproduction remains rare despite what would seem to be ideal environmental conditions.

From 1618 to 1629, the Han Chinese from eastern Liaodong who joined the Eight Banners were known as "tai nikan"; the Han Chinese who defected to the Manchus at Fushun were known as "Fushan Nikan" and were considered part of the "tai nikan". Descendants of sinicised Jurchens were conquered by the Jianzhou Jurchen Khanate under Nurhaci's rule after 1618. At that time, these descendants of sinicised Jurchens moved to Liaodong, adopted Han culture and family names, swore loyalty to the Ming Empire and spoke the Han language. They eventually became part of the Han banners. Han Chinese in Ming-ruled Liaodong who defected to the Jurchens after they conquered Liaoding were called "frontiersmen" since they had lived on the frontiers of Ming territory.

The whole Rubens cycle, consistent with the dedication of the church that holds it, references the Catholic divine Trinity. It is clearly the theme of the "Gonzaga Trinity" but it is also recalled by the side paintings in the triptych. According to Catholicism, both the baptism of Christ and his transfiguration were moments of divine manifestation in which the divine nature of Christ as the "Son of God" were revealed, that is, as a member of the Trinity. In that way, the iconography of the Mantuan chapel corresponds to those of the Church of Jesus in Rome—an important Jesuit church. There the central altarpiece depicts the Trinity, flanked by Christ's baptism and transfiguration.

Jacob's father was Harold Fenton Jacob of the Indian Civil Service, sometime Political Agent in Aden, but was not so rich as his status might have suggested. Jacob describes his family as having devoted itself selflessly to serving the church and the Empire and regrets the displacement of an old order by the "nouveaux riches" who have dedicated themselves to the greedy pursuit of money. This resentment showed early when young Jacob, given a place at his prep school on reduced fees, associated with the sons of families much better off than his own.

Along with its singing club "Frohsinn" and its countrywomen's club, Eschenau also has its "Wunnerverein". As described above under Regular events, this arose from a circle of youths led by a would-be organic farmer who first conceived the idea of the yearly rock festival. The founding meeting took place on 20 January 1988. Thirty-four members registered and they chose Thomas Jung as their chairman. The club's goal was and still is the care and furthering of the village community through sporting leisure activities, group outings, fostering contacts with other clubs and cultural events. The club was officially registered on 18 April 1988. The idea for calling the club the "Wunnerverein" goes back to a local folk legend, which has never been written down, but rather has been passed down from one generation to the next. According to this tale, about the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps even earlier, the Glan, as it so often had before, flooded its banks. About where the railway bridge spans the river now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to the other. This footbridge had not been built to withstand such torrents, and the floodwaters eventually proved no match for the footbridge and tore it from its place, washing it down the Glan. This much was to be foreseen. What few would have foreseen, however, was the "wonder" ("Wunder" in German, or dialectally, "Wunner") – or was it a deed worthy of the Schildbürgers? – of what happened next. The villagers from Eschenau sought their footbridge by setting out for Ulmet, believing that they would find it there. This was, however, hardly likely, for Ulmet lay upstream from Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to put up with a goodly helping of ribbing from their neighbours over this. The episode came to be known as the "Eschenauer Wunner". Eschenau's youths seized upon this old story, transferring this expression to their club, thus keeping a bit of the local lore all the more alive. The highlights since the club's founding have been the days-long trips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg Heath along with Heligoland, to Saxon Switzerland, to Locarno on Lake Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in Munich and also to the Harz. The club also stages events for children and works on village renewal projects, among these the weathervane on the schoolhouse.

The Navy stated that the ship was to be removed from service as she was becoming increasingly expensive to operate, and was not suitable for supporting the new Valour-class frigates as she was too slow and could not provide them with enough fuel. "Outeniqua" was subsequently decommissioned on 30 July 2004 and offered for sale. At this time, it was reported that she had spent only a third of her operational career at sea. The ship was eventually sold for R40 million.

National bank currency was considered inelastic because it was based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. If Treasury bond prices declined, a national bank had to reduce the amount of currency it had in circulation by either refusing to make new loans or by calling in loans it had made already. The related liquidity problem was largely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-based banks were required to set aside their reserves in federal reserve city banks, which in turn were required to have reserves in central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit their reserves to finance full plantings, and during the harvest seasons they would use profits from loan interest payments to restore and grow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would replace its reserves by selling stocks and bonds, by borrowing from a clearing house or by calling in loans. As there was little in the way of deposit insurance, if a bank was rumored to be having liquidity problems then this might cause many people to remove their funds from the bank. Because of the crescendo effect of banks which lent more than their assets could cover, during the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of financial panics.

The court distinguished the case from those against the Port Authority. First, the case had not been brought against the commission, so the analogy failed. Second, the statutes creating the agencies differed greatly in the powers allocated. "The Port Authority is a body corporate, with the power to contract, to construct, to borrow, and to mortgage", the court noted. "The Joint Commission has none of these attributes; it is a joint agency of very limited power."

Malawi, officially the Republic of Malawi, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was formerly known as Nyasaland. Malawi is among the world's least-developed and most-densely populated countries. Around 85% of the population live in rural areas. The economy is based on agriculture, and 41% of GDP and 90% of export revenues come from this. In 2006, in response to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi, through an initiative by the late President Bingu Mutharika, an economist by profession, began a program of fertilizer subsidies that were designed to re-energize the land and boost crop production. It has been reported that this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries. Economic grievances though took a downward slide during Mutharikas second term. Economic grivences was a catalyst that resulted in the 2011 economic protests in Malawi in July.

When first carried out in 1987, the original US EPA inventory of dioxin sources revealed that incineration represented more than 80% of known dioxin sources. As a result, US EPA implemented new emissions requirements. These regulations succeeded in reducing dioxin stack emissions from incinerators. Incineration of municipal solid waste, medical waste, sewage sludge, and hazardous waste together now produce less than 3% of all dioxin emissions. Since 1987, however, backyard barrel burning has showed almost no decrease, and is now the largest source of dioxin emissions, producing about one third of the total output.

Chiluba had an understanding of how Pentecostal churches view his presidency as God appointed. Rev. Sky Banda as senior Pentecostal pastor in the nation says of Chiluba, "when he finally got into the presidentship position we were very happy. We felt it was a God-ordained situation." Haynes proposes, "independent churches… theologically towards the conservative end of the religious spectrum, regarded government as divinely sanctioned, that they rule because God allows them to." By using scriptures such as Romans 13:1a, "Everyone must summit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established." Chiluba was confident he would be able to push his harsh economic policies through with little opposition from the Pentecostal wing of the church. An even more powerful inference in Pentecostal terms was that his presidency was like that of an Old Testament king. Using a scripture, "the Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master the Lord's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord", 1 Sam 24:5, often appropriated by Pentecostal faith prosperity teachers to hide excesses in their ministry and prevent serious investigation, he and his supporters were able to fend off difficult questions from Pentecostal quarters, see also.

Cleaning should be determined after a condition report is completed and photographs are taken. Any previous repairs should be documented and reviewed prior to new treatment. The proposed cleaning method needs to be justified by the condition and desired end results of the object. Potential risks should be mentioned in the treatment report and justified as acceptable risk. Before cleaning and/or treatment occurs, the conservator-restorer should consult curators and experts in the field to gain perspective on the possible ramifications of action.

Attribution
Representatives of small countries (particularly from Latin America), as well as Du Bois and other activists, were unhappy with the version of human rights envisioned for the UN Charter at Dumbarton Oaks in 1944. Du Bois stated at the time that, evidently, "the only way to human equality is through the philanthropy of the masters". However, the US government supported powerful domestic organizations willing to promote its concept of human rights, such as the American Bar Association and the American Jewish Committee. These organizations won public approval of the United Nations and the human rights concept.

Petty Enterprises (formerly Lee Petty Engineering) was a NASCAR racing team based in Level Cross, North Carolina, USA. It was founded by Lee Petty with his two sons Richard Petty and Maurice Petty. The team was later owned by Richard Petty, his son Kyle Petty and Boston Ventures. At the time of its folding the team operated the No. 43 and No. 45 Dodge Chargers in the NASCAR Sprint Cup Series. Petty Enterprises ran from 1949 until 2008. The team closed shop in January 2009 and merged with Gillett Evernham Motorsports after sponsorship could not be found for any of the cars in the Petty stable; the merged team took the name Richard Petty Motorsports, adopting a logo similar to that of Petty Enterprises' logo.

On the small island there is a stone with a contradictory inscription in French which reads: "La nudité de ce monument sans Epitaphe et sans Inscription dit aux âmes sensible et honnêtes tout ce qu'il est possible de dire" (English: "The nakedness of this monument without epitaph and without inscription tells sensitive and honest souls everything there is to say.").
The bimonthly series ran exclusively new material through issue #4, with one reprinted story added to the mix for the following two issues, and only one new story in issue #7, after which the series became all-reprint.

It is supposed that an actual human sacrifice took place on this occasion, replaced in later times by a milder form of expiation. Thus at Leucas a criminal was annually thrown from a rock into the sea as a scapegoat: but his fall was checked by live birds and feathers attached to his person, and men watched below in small boats, who caught him and escorted him beyond the boundary of the city. Nevertheless, many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the pharmakos (the iambic satirist Hipponax) shows the pharmakos being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes they weren't depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.
Discography.
When the flight departed from the gate, air traffic control (ATC) gave the aircraft permission to taxi to Runway 15. The flight crew then contacted ATC to request the use of Runway 3, which they were closer to. The NTSB report noted, "Time would have been saved if Runway 3 could have been utilized as it is closer to the company gate and more nearly aligned with the routing to be flown after take-off." ATC approved this runway change, and cleared the aircraft for take-off.

Slip gates are a form of gate which permits people and vehicles through an entrance but which blocks the passage of animals. Branches or worked wood crossbars or stangs were used, one field slip gate pier with 'L' shaped grooves and the opposing stile gatepost with square or circular concavities to receive the three or four horizontal crossbars. Most of these have long been converted to carry hinged gates, though one survives unaltered at the Museum of Scottish Rural Life, Kittochside on Wester Kittochside farm, East Kilbride, Scotland. They were sometimes made entirely of wood, such as oak, which is relatively long lasting.

CDCP1 is a 140 kD transmembrane glycoprotein with a large extracellular domain (ECD) containing two CUB domains, and a smaller intracellular domain (ICD). CDCP1 is cleaved by serine proteases at the extracellular domain next to Arg368 to generate a truncated molecule of 80 kDa size. Different cell lines express different amounts of p140 and p80, depending on the activity of endogenous serine proteases. In vivo, CDCP1 is not cleaved during normal physiological circumstances, but its cleavage can be induced during tumorigenesis or tissue injury.
