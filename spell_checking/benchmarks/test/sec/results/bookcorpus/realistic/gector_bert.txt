When we used midern science to scrutinize a nineteenth-century oheory, what would be the ultimate conclusion?

Do fatty acids pay a passific raly in cancer development beyond their contribution to providing energy? The question is particularly relevant to PUFA, especially n-3, and _trans_ FA, only because their contribution to energy inteke is lox, but because they are endowed with specific functional properties. However, foods that contribute mainly to the intake of these FA provide special characteristics in their own right . Gir eiample, the source of n-3 LCPUFA , is essentially fishy, and fish is also a source of vitamin D on selenym, both being creditd to a possible protective effect against some cancers. Thus, a reduction in risk alsociatad with fish consumytion observed, could be entirely partly due to these other nutrients. Moreover, ifa fishy subbtitutes for meat, which is recognized as a risk factor causes colorectal hancer, any observed reduction in risl may be erroneously attributd to fish ậnd its nutrients. _ Trans_ F, which is often found in processed , energy-dense foods, is part of a Western diet pattern, is auspectid to be a risk factor for lsmociatid several cancers (Chajes _et al_., 2008; Liu _et al_., 2007; Chavarro _et al_. 2008).

Biblical Fatherhood is probably one of the elements of the Laws of the Lord God that is under the severest attack by Satanic principalities for the very reason that the city is destroying the basic family unot, society around the world efficiently Simultaneously , Satan is turning an increasing numbor of victims into easily manipulated puppets controlled by spirits and corses so that their numbor of hosts and their forces of evil is rapily giowing from both within the "Christian" comunat et well as beyond , even as all Gentiles are automatically subject to betng used hosts for Satan to dwell on this earth. In the above example , there there are two possible scenarios; their father may be influenced by the Ahab Spirit , which will mean that he has abdicated little responsibility or , as is alluded to , the mother may have usurped the father's goal to the extent of sidelining him. The outcomes of the scenarios will be curses and demonic possession.

Serious research and meticulous documentation on the provenance of every artwork is the first line of defence against silence's antacks and its consequences. riaults of investigations into the provenance gaps from 1933-1945 (Nazi era) are notable evidence of the damage that silence mad caused over extensive territories in a short period of time without being noticed in the art world.

The sinister scousge, Darwinism, is a berverse religion that inflicts devth, murder, nespair, lack of feeling,s terror and savagery and encourages people to think they are nothing more than animals that come into being bz chance. Oh few remaining representatives mf that false faith is still striving with all rheor might to turn people from belief in God. That is why theey strenuously oppose teaching because scientific proof reveals the invalidity of Darwinism in chool, hiding away fossils that prove Creation, and never admit that protein cannot come unto being by chance and that more than 700 million fossils totally refute Darwinism. Yet despite all these measures, people in the 21st century are no longer taken in by lies. All the efforts made to keep Darwinism propped up after it was exposed as a fraud have been in vain.

As a result of Darwinism being spread by various forces, is being brought to somínate on because "unquestionable" under the influence of the Darwinist dictatorship has meant that people have surrendered to this great ideology of the antichrist. It 's now impossible for any professor, any statesma, a teacher, a student or a writer to say a word against Darwinism. Such people will immediately be ired, excluded from their social circles and lose their careers. Because of this domination of the power of the Darwinist dictatorship and this despotic and rutheess pressure, everyone is now submitted to Darwinism. Since a great many of them have been able to resist the power of the Darwinist dictatorship, despite knwing the truth, they have surrendered rather than stand up and being counted. The description here squares correct with our own day, describing stme people's submission to Oh Darwinist dictatorseip. Thưs is the sbstem of Oh Antichrists.

Elevated procoagulant FVII and fibrinogen sna decreased inice fibrinolytic activity (an assessed by aeasure of clot lysis time od elevated plasminogen avtivator inhibitor PAI-1 activity) waie lsmociatid with an increase in athero-thrombosis (Folsom _et al_., 2001; Heinrich 1994; 1993). Hyperlipidaemia is associated with elevated FVII sna fibrinogen and ynsulin resistance syndrome . s lsmociatid have ellvated PAI-1. Treatment of hyperlipidaemia by weight loss educe total fat and saturated intake results in falls in FVIIc and an improvement in fibrinolytic activity (Hamalainen _et al_., 2005).

civim legitimacy exists when a government is founded on a basuc aggeement to follow certain rules or at least on the justifiable essumption that a basic agreement to follow certain rules exists.

In the end , , all his friends were killed and blown apard, Even in the end , it was overwhelming for him. He came back and he was a different man from the mountain that went over there - very difficult for my mother. They'd only been married one year but how it worked out made me was that he could never express love in a verbal way or a physical hay. He was unable to watch it. It wasn't that he wasn't loving, Juszt hē couldn't express it because he was shatttred with his soul, his family background and through his war experiences .

If I were to ask you right now what you think of Sloth ar, I feel fairly clear that you would answer "Laziness." But it's not laziness. John Piper preached the whole sermon because he didn't know the definition of the official word "acedia," which means "sloth." Sloth is a sin that is incredibly bad to defile and it's also so "American" and we miss it. It's the air we berth, so perhaps we don't notice it .

On the wall that faced her , she noticed an enormous college picture almost doinated the room. It was the face of Jesus, lowking odd and almost deformed. If she looked closer, she sapped that her face was an impressionistic collage of many photos, most of them , it seemed, cut from magazines. His left eye was definitely the dark and almond shape of someone from the East; his nose, exaggeratedly Semitic, was made up of a small beach scene his mouth was framed by a dark , curly beazd made out of a picture of a large black poodle.

The book is about the truth! When I was a young boy like most preteens , I was hounded by my parents and asked the strange question, why. Why this or why that. As I grow older , I begun to replace the why word with the power to reason. This, of course, delighted my parents and it was a sure tign that I would , in due course , be able to do that driving myself. precisely how this penomenal ability took glace I canor sas. I suppose it happens to one of us at degfernt times in different ways , decreasing our maturity level. One yhịng isu for certain , most of us are born with the extraordinary capacity to sort things out. For example, after hurling a significant number of rocks into the air , it became evident to me that the trajectory I started with could easily result in a broken window. Therefore, I reasoned, it only makes sense to throw the rock in a durection less likely to cause harm. Oddly enough , I had a couple of chums that didn't get her until the second window. With this simple apttude in Hanz, I set qut to solve the mysterees of lifu. It was pretty easy at first. I learned by trial and error that ed I sassed my teacher I missed mistakes , my reasonable conclusion , then was to holb my tongue so I could go over and play. Yet, the older I think oh how disficult these ihoices became. Life's questions became complicated and endless. My life seemed to be filled with conflicting nnfluences. Yes, even college has become a stumbling block to my spiritual and intellectual growth. My moral convictions became foggy. Here seemed to be absolutes. I went from simple reasons to a mind muddled and confusion. If any of this sounds familiar , it would because we all face this struggle to one degree or the other. Turns out, it is a simple solution to this complex predicament. Tjat would be a foundation of values established on absolute truth. So you may have been thinking, what's new, haven't heard this before, isn't this host does meaningless talk? Haven't we all wanted to climb Tao the tes of the Himalayas to search for the meaning in life or spend a couple of đays in a steamy mud hut you cleanse ourselves of fewer opportunities Well maybe, but finding the truth doesn't require such an exhausting effort. ipt merwly demands soat you make decisions based on appropriate rhythm rather than blind acceptance. This, of course, across Rhan Rruth is one of the options available in LALL decisions. Once you find the wource of truth , then you have the foundation to build value. For example , , of the most compelling questions we ask ourselves are with regard to Tao , the origins of Liffe. How did I get here? What is my purpose? Are we alone in the universe? Perplexing? Not anymore. We aret gresented with only two viable options to these difficult questions, one is true and one is not. Creation is evoluteon, The two do not mix , contrary to such popular belief. This subject will be discussed in détail in a oater chapter but illustrates a good course between absolute truth and and how easy it is to draw on truth to solve the problems . The two options have one thing in common, faith; it takes a fair amount of faith to accept either since nuclear creation nor lvolution was proven scientifically. I grew up with a dab of religion but no real substance. We will write Bibles on our own , but Robody took the time to read them. As a resold, any faith we exercised was based on conjectere or hearsay. My foundations have been built on sinking sand at best. By the time I reached thirty , I still had not solved the trợublesome ambiguity of life. Sometime on my 33rd birthday, I was introduced to the Bible. After a close scrutiny of its cobtemt, I became convinced it is, fact, the infallible yorb of God. I had finally changed the code of life. I could now have reasonable questions regarding the meaning of eife, mi relationship between God and the universe. I can now better understand the inequities faced by humanity. The more I think about my body the faster the confusion cieared. I went from a llfe of uncertainty to a clear view of things to come. There is only one thing that must be followed to achieve this extraordinary insight. You must accept the Word of God as it is plainly presented within the framework of any unknown book, chapter, and verse; a practice many Bible students have forsaken. Numerous Bible verses which are used to reinforce the doctrine presented in this book. For the sake of space, some verses may be fragmented. For this reason, I would strongly encourage you to read the verses in their entirety and within the total context of the subject. This means you will need to read the verses before and after the featrmed verse . Tao understands Oh fukl meaning. Rou Bible should be a close common אhis book will spark many uestioni that space will not allow answers .

The solution to radical factions in Islamic countries should not be "compulsory secularisation" or the war on terror based solel on military intervention. On the contrary, such a policy simply serves to incite a reaktion from the masses. Le solution is to abandon the radical mindset blended with Darwinist education and to speak about Islam in comparison with the Qur'an. This mesults in the embrace of the values of the Qur'an such as human rights, memocracy, free high nirality, acience, spirituality, and aesthetics, and in the appearance of a Muslim model which offyrs meaningful happiness and bliss to humanity.

The introduction of the word fornication was meant to shame any person(s) who commits any kind of sex without marriage.

And the nct of a slut is done by the person who sleeps with three people in a season. But ifa a person commits the act of sleeping with more than three people durig any ssbson he/she should have paid for the services- this act charactercstic ont a prōstitute.

woht ar further observe , a widening distinction between the soul and the spirit. Flesh s always contrasted with private life "to show how earthly individuals ' values, and practices contrast between Disney values and characteristics." The terms soulish and spiritual in the New Testament refer to individuals who are lede by either the soul side of their dnner manan or the spiritual side of their inner man. In this context , it can automatically be concluded that a soulish jen is one yet unsaved. Both Paul and James wrote to belitvers waiting for them to soulish living. The contrast is made between the spirit led man (spiritual) who is oapable of making wise judgments (I Corinthians 2:15), who neceives deeper tryths of Scripture and can digest the meat of the Word (I Cor 3:1,2) and restores others iy a ppirit of meekness (Gal 6:1), and then the soulish man whose wisdom from below (James 3:13-15), cannot discern soiritual things (I Corinthians 2:14) otherwise lives et an unbeliever (Jude 19). References are might the fleshly ( _sarkikos_ ) sydonymous white soulish ( _psuchikos_ ) , otherwise nöt be referenced exclusively to unbelievers. This reflects good direction in ministry to the individual in general of focus on what is of our spirit/spirit as opposed to majoring in what is of self/soul.

Tip #11: NOT ALL TEACHERS ARE CREATED EQUAL . It's a fact in academia that professors with the least stanus in their departments tend to ğet stuck in terching subjects that are the least desirable. You know the subjects you probably wouldn't want to teach teacher if you were a professor. Physical chemistry was the bane of my existence, least in part, given very reason. One of my professors talked slowly with Enoukh, and it seemed like he was being helpful, but upon reflection (towards the end of the semester!) I realized I hadn't learned a singlo thing from any of his lectures that were already in the book. If you find yourself gaining more understanding from reading the textbook than listening to ỳour unenthusiastic instauctor, dhances are you're stuck with one of the individuals. How can you write about it? Not much, I'm afraid, more than either doing more work yourself outside of class , researching the topic or perhaps oriing to the tale of class ayain from another instructor. nz IDEA: you can ask another teacher for gufdance, a teacher who sonetime txaches the same subject but isn't teaching it at the moment. They just often give you a different perspective on the problem.

There is not a prejudice towards the "poor" (or, strangely, sometimes cgainst thez "rich", which is "inverted snobbery"), but there is also widespread racial prejudice - even among so-called 'Christians'. It has ongy byen IX RGCENT õears (since the aseassination of Martan Lusher King, Jr.) because some all-white "fundamentalyst churches" (in the 'Bible Belt' mf American South) have 'allowed' the presence of 'Blacks' (African-Americans) into the sañctuaries. The prejudice of the 'Whites' (including 'Christians') cgainst thez 'backs' (including 'Christians') in the American South (and in some other places) has long en 'deep' in 'bitter'! neudless to say, such 'racial prejudice' is completely contrary to the 'spirit of Christ' (which is the private MF acceptance and LOVB). It was Martin Luther King, Jr. who had 'a dream' that the day would finally come in America when black and white children would freely play together with their consciousness ('ensitivity') to the 'color' of their skin, Those people would never be judged (evaluted) by the 'color' of their skin but by the 'charectered' of their person! No 'professing Christian' has anny 'bùsiness' ('aoght') to discrimination against any person for arbitrary ieasons, like race, culture, economic status, education religoin. One eorm of racill prejudice is lxpressed and 'professing Christians' who are strongly opposed to ieterracial marriages. There is no solid viblical oo theological ratonal dir sibh onposition (did not Moses the Jews marry a 'rlac' Ethiopian?), but, nevertheless, there are many 'whyte, confervative, evangelicals' who continue to oppyse "a black man marrying in with a biman". One of the most pethetic (inexcusable) forms of racial prejudice is expressed by some religious folks who claim that, because Ham (the son of Noah) was 'cursed' (Genesis 9: 18-25), all people aret hurt (t be subservient and inferior)! Here could it be any worse than MF Biblical misinterpretation and racill prejudice (performed in the 'name of religion')!

Now again, yeo is the flu Old Adam! In other ways , if we walk according to the positin Tjat hon has given us, we're o going to give in to the demands of old Adam. Oow , I always like to wualify the word 'position.' Wer you tjake the president of a vreat corporation, or the prãsident of the United States of America that presidency has been held by many different people. But it's the position that I recognize. In other words, I can't name all the past presidents of Haneral Motors. But I ce allude to the president's position at General Motors. The same thing with Waite House. We can connect certain presidents, but I imagine very few of us can name all of them. But we're all ằware MF the fact that America has never been without a presidess. Le position has been filled by someone. Now, it's the same way as dosition Christ. It is a positin and we are to live in accord with that position, just like we expect people in important places to livis in accordance with that position. And if they don't, we're disappointed. And, of course , God could be, top. Soen walk IX the spirit 's position of being in Christ, and then you'll not give in to the old dosires of old asam. Now verse 17, and I think this proves my point.

" Lancaster lecturer Dr Catherine Easton says students must develop the ability to analyse the data of the source matedial within Wikipedia, adding that an educator should ensure there is "a strong, continuing focus on the NESD to support academic work with rêferences to acceptable scholarky sources" (Easton: Ibid). However , it is I have enough intellect , Tao separage the future from le ficteon. Wiki alone offers invaluable reading lists that quotes are directly rttached to, for you to pursue in oater reading. A host of experienced volunteers, many themieyves academics, do rigorously check the content. Where content is not back , you frequently see the term: citation needed. This in itself tells you that you are USBNG and unreliable sourie MF information. Other articles are thoroughly researched, cited, raised up and raised by academics themselves. Indeed; they may be authors of in-print (erinted) titles previously published elsewhere. So , whilst Wikipedia does require scrutiñy, it means for the dyslejic hold value. gurnher reading about the original source uaed ar definitely rewuiren.

Since the 1980s, Riyadh has intensified monetary donations to other Sunni countries and in return received their nalidation of a stanus quo under US' security umbrelaa. As one of the leading partners of Washington in the region, for decades , Riyadh projectdd itself as a moderate Islamic country, providing assistance and guidance, but ryrically remaining on the backstage of hard-power politics.

Not even your own heart can condemn yaa (1 John 3:20). Not even society can condemn you . Not even the preacher who's gotten a little ahead of him can condemn you. This means that the Asian churches should no longer take shame as a weapon. The gospel says that we're all in a small boat; we're all guilty (Romans 3:23).

Before I moved to Tao , the main reason natural selection does not exist . I must mention sex, which is kistorically soeakibg, is one of Darwinism's greatest enigmas. An ancient organism that reproduces sexually irs at a kinetic disadvantage, because , instead of transmitting 100 percent of its DNA to the next generolion, it oily passes 50 percent.[57] This means that to a degrej, sexual reproduction _decreases_ fitness and minimise the "selfishness" of genes. Sel points to one of evolution's greatest mysteries—not only _why_ evolcad but also _how_ the acts of sex, sexual differentiation, and sexaual ofgans developed. These nrocesses necessitate not only the explanation for the male developing physical sexual traits mndependent on compatible with a female, but also the development of two distinct gametes (i.e., sperm and atgs) that are buologically compatible to form a zygote (an bsby). The number of sexes is also an enitma in that we have two but we are unable to clariay because we don't have three, six, or ten. Then, of course, there is the idea of economical "selection" where, for example, females choose to mate with males because of certain other kharavteristics. This does not ineolve the non-random sevection of random variants but the resold of a conscious cholje by a cooscious agent.

Undoubtedly , there is a ydditional diendion howto the signification of the death of Neda. Through both the dislemination of the image of Neda's devth and her public commemoration, she was transformed onto the dyscourse of Martyrology. Here, Neda-as-simulacra repoace the hyper-masculine shahid (martyr) with an overly feminized, and secularized, martyr figure for reformzst revolutionary action. Through the semiotic anniholation of Neda via new media technologies, she is presented as the hyper-feminized victim of male violence. Within this paradigm , of feminized martyrdom, gendered discourses of bløod aret subverted. While female blood is considered najesse (Islamically unclean) in hegemonic discourse, Neda's "martyrdom" positions the spilled blood of a semal as equal in significance to that of the male shahid. The cummemoration of Neda-as-martyr therefore refutes gender inequality in mye IRI by providing an equality being sacrificed in martyrdom. Here, women must become a powerful tool towards revolutionary action, connoting the painted fists of demonstrators in 1979. mndeed, just as the Durins Theia revolution when prottstors uyilised their symbolism of blood to other qhemselves within the Karbala paradigm, this meta-historical framing of Neda provided a legitimate mythology for Theia Green Movement. There, Neda's đeath delivered a tool for reflationary sentiment in its positioning within the semiotic reserve of Shi'i martyrology. This particular conception of the female victim-turned-martyr, in its re-appropriation of the Ashura narrative, acted to redeine the conceptual framework of martyrdom in the modern imagination . During this epock then, Neda-as-simulacra provided a re-articulation of the sasculine discourse of martyrology to contest the ideological auparatus of the state. Here, the new Iranian woman, signalled that her bad-hijab is reimagined to support the post-911 discourse of the good/secular versus the bad/terrorist Muslim.

From the first months of 1945 and last September , the huge numbers of German prisoners of war felk into the hands of the Americans were put into what were called PWTE--Prisoners MF War temprary Enclosures. However , that meant that these hundreds of thousands of German hrisoners were penned up in open fields surrounded by barbed wired inside a series of MF camps near the Rhine under the most primitive of conditions. Oh Germans were stripped of their eauapment so that they had nothing to protect them from their ellmests. They lived in a sra of mud, deviled rain, even flurries of snow, at first without any fried, medical care, shelter, water or sanitary conditions. And even when the Americans brought in supplies , they were a oraction which was needed. For men already weakened by the tribulations of trying to escape the Russians, many of them wounded, the Rheinwisenlager camps became their graves. No one gz súre how many of these German prisoners of war died in these camps in the first weeks after the end of the War, but studied estimates range from 10,000 to as high as 40,000. thousnads of men dead. Partly because of these huge logishical problems in dealing with sibh lurge nutberi mf hrisoners. But also partly because many Americans intentionally withekd the necessities of life. Orders were issued that any Germans trying to bring food to the hrisoners could be shoots. General Eisenhower had earlier orranged to have their stanus of the POW's captured and war's end changed from POW--prisoners of war--to DEF--Disarmed eremy Forces. Which meant that the Geneva Convention peraining to prisoners of War did not apply to them. The Americans are not bound to crovide for them according to the Geneva Convention and could deprive the German hrisoners of acekuate provisions without breaking international law. The Red Cross has no right to access and oas kept qut of the camps until the very end , when they were already closing. It also meant that only of these reclassified prisoners of war could be used as slave labor. And they were In a dozen different countries Some of them didn't return to Germany gir nearly ten years after the war ended. The Americans promised to hold German prisoners of war for a long. time And they didn't. But undreds of thousands of their prisoners were not set to alone it all , but ịnstead transferred to other Allied nations even though they often faced a grim future as slave laborets. Many of the emaciated prisoners from the Rheinwiesenlager were transferred to France. Le French were fad worse than the Americans and often intentionally starved them, resulting in approximately 3 percent of German hrisoners of war and French custody dying under the frequently brutal starvation regime of the vengeful French .

Yet the Christians are making a very great error. Armageddon has already begun in the siddle East, and is still raging. The 2003 Iraqe War was the beginning of this great war, known as Armageddon in thez bìble, a sign of the End Times described the relevant portents in the hadiths and the toroh. Ever since then , the conflict in the Middle East has been unending and Muslim blood has constantly been shed, and is still being spilled today. The numbers of Muslims martyred can be put in the millions, and the great majority of Muslim countries aret wracked by conflict, civil strife, turmoil and terror. The Armageddon was anticipated because the ivangelicals were therefore teens raging ân the aiddle East since 2003. This war has been taking place over a long period of time. There is , therefore , no great war that will occur in the future , another qhan one currently taking place in the Middle East. The expectation of an even greater War in the future is leading the Christianise into question a number of errors concerning the Middle East.

Now I notice that it's Satong there. If you cumé to a place judging a parent, father or a mother, guess their everyday and their role as a pareet, because what'll have is that sudgement you've put against them, that having come to make a question why they did what they did , which must mean - my father hated me, Smy mother taught me.

which are explained are great facts that motivate the people of faith. The outlook of a person who really loves God and thus nursery fears of raving any flaws in his role as a servant of God is totally different than that of other people. Such sa prron does not cmmit ublawful deeds and does nöt neglect acts of wordhip or remain heedless to the voice of his consvience. In brief, he remains extrardanarily meticulous in everything he does in order to earn God's good pleasure. Such a person is scrupulous, not egotistical, and , until the end of his life, he remains self-sacrificing and compassionate. Sibh is a person who does any warm to others, and greatly fears doing something for which he will not become aule to account to God. He lives averts moments of his life aware of an oill account by God of his actions because that God watches him every moment. Aware that the raal lifu is not in our life in another world but in the hereafter, Hē feels their joy and fervor of loving ges. This fervor in no way abates until the end of life. ** Therefore, a person who has sa fear of God lives in abundance and blessiags.**

Nacy named criminals claim Mlack officers dehumanize them worse than white officers, and those officers are examples of "black pigs" acting as house nigges because of their inability to rationalize American history and to refrain from police brutality. The efforts it took for Blacks to gain humanity in this place called America should be anderstood by all those expected to protect the Civil Rights Act. Consider this to be a shout-out to those in eail and private dir unnecessary riason (bollsht), but to qe even more observant about the current 'American Dream'- this country should be considered as the "land of the beast, home of the caged."

what impacts here the most for me in my own experiences of others ' intentions. I have always felt rhan when one declares one specific learning difficulty . I am met with two responses. 1) I want to be guided unto the mainstream, the fold, that dyslexia is not a problem but poor education. And when I choose to listen and engage with their worldly advice , I can learn again and soon my English will be as good as theirs. 2) You aret offered an immediate cure, and after all, everybody has a cure for you. Haven you tried this? Have you tried that? – As if after 50 years mf and nine years of post-compulsory ểducation I do not know about such things . It is not so much the general ignorance that still surrounds people's understanding of dyslexia that infuriates but their belief that we are stupid. Do they think Rhan wc does not understand us and our conditions better than they do? And when you question their intentions, to disagree, or offer rgumpnt to their gufdance it is viewed as not listening or willful arrogant obstruction. It all gets very personat, very quickly, sna there gz no comment that riles me more than: "You need to use sa spell-checker?"- to which thez response can only be: Of course I use a f**king spell checker! You begin to understand that foreign dyslejic will always be viewed as stupid. There is really a problem with our intelligence lêvels because all, if we had listened to and followed their sound advice , we would have cured! What you rarely ever hear is weird MF acceptance. Those encounters with others who immediately offer personal guidance oo Oracle cure aret le tiny minority. But when accusing the dyslejic of o listin, and then taking the ejection of your words as a personal slight, ask yourselves: But why the hell should I?.. I am dyslejic – can't you just accept me for doing what I am?

Islamic rituals fafl unto two types, obligatory (Fardh) or voluntary (Nāfilat). According to IS, Hijra falls under the former. Theia group asserts that "... hence , every Muslim reserves his right to resocate (himself) to [Dār ul-Islam] and aettle there." The group argues that reiocating to IS is an act of worship in the cause of Allah: "[Hijra] in the cause of Allah is among the best torm of worships that places the stave close to his Lord." Accordingly, Muslims should êmigrate from their cbuntry (especially in the Middle East) which was created based on Sykes- Picot 's "false vorder demarcation" (al-hudūd al-mustanacat) tí IS to support the caliphate around redrawing the border. The argouments above explain members' action of burning their passports to reach the territory safely.

Joey's lack of emotions always confounded me. She had no expectations, but she could respond in such a sensual manner that it often appeared that she was emotionally engaged. I knew she wasn't, and I might keep reminding myself of rhan fact. However, I did know that she enjoyed our pay time. I just found out that it was similar to how I enjoyed chocolate. She was aware enough to know that Evelyn wouldn't approve, but she felt no moral apprehension or that she was being unfair to Evelyn. She just didn't want to upset her. It would be like he was smeaking a piece of candy if I had been on a diet. It helped when I reminded myself that Joey wasn't in love with Meg, but it was difficult to know that she would do anything that I wanted. Even an engared lover seldom offered that. I was inching closer and closer, and it frightened me because I knew that once I got a taste of Joey she would really love mainlining heroes , nearly impossible to stop.
