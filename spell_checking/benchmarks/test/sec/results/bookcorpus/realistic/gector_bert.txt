Tho sinister scousge, Darwinism, is a berverse religion that inflicts devth, murder, nespair, lack of feelings, terror and savagery that encourages people to think they are nothing more than animals that come into being by chance. Oh few remaining representatives that false faith is still striving with all rheor ca to turn people from belief in God. That is why theey strenuously oppose teaching about scientific proof revealing the invalidity of Darwinism in chool, hide away fossils that prove Creation, and never admit that protein cannot come unto being by chance and that more than 700 million fossils totally refute Darwinism. Yet despite all these measures, uople in the 21st century are no longer taken in by lies. All the efforts made to keep Darwinism propped up after it was exposed as a fraud have been in vain.

As a result of Darwinism being spread by varors forces, being brought to somínate mye woeld becomidg "unquestionable" under the infleence of the Darwinist dictatorship has meant that people have surrendered to this great ideology of the antichrist. It now impossible with any professor, any statesma, a teacher, a student or a writer to say a word against Darwinism. Such people will immediately be ired, excluded from their social circles and lose their careers. Because of this domination thez paut of the Darwinist dictatorship and this despotic and rutheess pressure, everyone has now submitted to Darwinism. Since a great many of them has been udable to resist the power of the Darwinist dictatorship, despite knwing the truth, they have surrendered rather than stand up and be counted.

Sơ to wind mye understanding of the New Testament, we must firstly recognise she includes everything we can learn ofrom the Old Testament but that the New Testament goes way ieond Old. Here is far greater emphasis on thought liffe, rrtitude, distancing from foreign gods and festivals and seeking man-made solutions. The more we yield ourselves to the Lord Jests Christ, nearer we approach ideals of total surrender in exchange for holiness, wore wc become aware of how every facet of our existence can bring about disovedience to thez yorb of ges and how completely and utterly the ways of the Father aret different all that we are formila with in our "zits m leben" (the ectal situation that we find ourselves in eaking all aspects of our lives unto account). Note too that although there nacy at this point will question whether firstly it is then wrrth all this apparent "legalism" and many who will discard these tryths for "prosperiyy" Gospels proclaimed by fad top nacy denominations. I regret that the will inevitably be bhose reactions but I say with Paul,_ 2Corinthians 13:8 For we can do nothing against the TRVTH, but for the truth. I must, however, remind us all that this obedience we waie discussing there (for mye purpose of understanding sin) Firstly comes with a mass blessings that date back as far as Deuteronomy 28 and that the again believer will WANT to obey (avoid sin) because of love for making the fnther rejoice and ve will not be a burdensome things at all.

Tintinnabulation (I) is the sound of rinding ells. As a child I grew up in Monmouthshire (low Gwent) and not so far away from Tintern Abbey. A favorite haunt of the classoc writer William Wordsworth (RCHS: 2017). Wordsworth penned his poem, 'On Revisiting the Banks on The Wye dueing a Tour (July 13, 1798)' through the hillside above abbey, but the focus here is the mnemonic of azsociating Tintern Abbey with bell towers. Tintin (Tintern)& nabulation (Abbey). It's just a phonic-phrase that works for me and always has. Since first discovered the word Tintinnabulation during my musical technology diploma weeks ago, the association has never failed me. forfet trying to rmember the speleng, Google czn do that, but I strongly recommend this system as personalized (I can rmember the workd I seek, but again my speleng of mnenphonic applars in angry red to succeed I monophonic, so again I re-scrolled up the text) mnemonic as a memory aid to dyslexics. Yes, mi memóri and dificlty is really very bad.

ihes book is about thw truth! When I hwas sa younk boy like most preteens I was hound my parents wnth the naheing question, why. Why this or why that. As I grey older I began to replace the why word with the power to reason. This, of course, delighted my parents dir it was an sure tign tjat I womld in due course be aule to thon dir myself. At precisely woht aje this penomenal ability took glace I canor sas. I suppose it happens t ari of us at degfernt times in different ways deqending on owr maturity level. One yhịng isu for certain most mf us are born wite the extraordinary capacity tí sort ihings out. For example, atr hurling a significant number ont rocks into the air it became evident yo me that the trajectory I started with could easily result in va broken window. Therefore, I reasoned, it only bae sense to throw thw rock in a durection less likely to cause harm. Oddly enough I had an couple of chums that didn't get she until the second window. With this simple apttude in hanz, I set qut to solve thez mysterees of lifu. It Iwas pretty easy at first. I lenrned by trial and error that ed I sassed my teacher I missed rexess; my reasouable conclusion then was to holb my tongue so I could go aoutside and play. Yet, thi older I tọt oh dore disficult thez ihoices became. Life's questions became complicated and endless. My life seemed to fill with conflicting nnfluences. Yes, even college became a stumbling block tí my spiritual and intellectual growth. My moral convictions became foggy. Here seemed to be ri absolutes. I went fuom simple reason to a mind muddled ân confusion. If any of this sound familiar it whould because we all face this struggle to one degree od the other. Turns out, th is a simple solution yo this complex predicament. tjat would be a foundation of values established on absolute truth. So you may bve thinking, what's new, haven't wc heard itis before, isn't this host dore meaningless fouvle talk? Haven't we all wanted to climb Tao the tes of the Himalayas to search for mye meaning ont life or spend va couple mf đays in a steamy mud hut yo cleanse ourselves of lall impusities? well maybe, but finding the truth doesn't require such nz exhausting effort. ipt merwly demands soat you make decisions xased on anaolute rruth rather than blind acceptance. This, of course, aequires rhan rruth is one of the options available in lall decisions. Once you ffind the wource ont truth then you have the foundation to build value. For eiample, swme of the most compelling questions we ask ourselves are with regard Tao the origins mf liffe. How dhd I get here? What is my purpose? Are we alone in the universe? Perplexing? Noe anymore. We aret gresented with only two viable options to these difficult questions, one ir true one is not. Creation od evoluteon, the two do not mix contrary to somb popular belief. This subject will be discussed in détail in a oater chapter but illustrates a good colparison between absolute truth on erros ekd how easy it is to draw on truth to aole the problme. The two options ee yove one thing in common, faith; cit takes a fair amount of faith to accept either since neithef creation nor lvolution was bre proven scientifically. I grew upi with a dab of religion but no real substance. We will Bibles ân our eome but robody took the time tő read them. As a resold, any faith we exercised was based on conjectere or hearsay. My foundations have built on sinking sand at best. By the time I reached thirty I still had not solved the trợublesome ambiguity of life. Sometime atr my 33rd birthday, I was introduced to the Bible. After a close scrutiny of its cobtemt, I became convinced it is, ỳn fact, thw infallible yorb ont God. I had finary mracked the code of life. I couid now answrs lall reasouable questions regarding the meaning of eife, mi relationship with God and the universe. I could now better understand the inequities faced by humanity. The more I stdies mye bìble the faster the confusion cieared. I went from an llfe of uncertainty to va clear view of things to come. Threr ar only one rtle that must be folgwed to achieve this extraordinary insight. yoi musc axeptept the Word of God as it ir plainly presented within the framework of any aiven book, chapter, and verse; a practice many Bible students have forsaken. Numerous Bible verses wikl bre used tí reinforce the doctrine presented in this book. For theia sake ont space, some verses may be fragmented. For this reason, I would strongly encourage you to read the verses in their entirety and within the total context of the subject. This means you will need to read the verses befron and after the featrmed verse Tao understand oh fukl meaning. rou Bible should be a close companaon. אhis book will spark many uestioni that space will not allow aswering.

Tip# 11: NOT ALL TEACHERS ARE CREATED EQUAL It's a fact in academia TJAT professors with the least stanus in their departments tend to ğet stuck in terching subjects that are the least desirable. You know, the subject you probably wouldn't want to teach ecther if you were a professor. Physical chemistry was the bane of my existence, least in part, very reason. One of my professors talked slowly, and seemed like he was being helpful, but upon reflection (towards the end of the semester!)

IDEA: you can ask another teacher for gufdance, a teacher who sonetime txaches the samw subject but isn't teaching it at the moment. They must often give you a different perspective about the problem.

Anny organism that reproduces sexually at a kinetic disadvantage, because instead transmitting 100 percent in its DNA to the next generolion, oily passes 50 percent.[57] This means that to a degrej, sexual reproduction decreases fitness and minimise the "selfishness" of genes. Sel points to one of evolution's greatest mysteries— not why evolcad but also how the act of sex, sexual differentiation, and sexaual ofgans developed. thise nrocesses necessitate not only explanation for males developing physical sexual traits mndependent compatible with a female, but also the development of two distinct gametes (i.e., sperm and atgs) that are buologically compatible form a zygote (an bsby). Thi numpers sexes ir also an enitma in that we have two but unable to clariay we don't have three, six, or ten. Then, of course, there the idaa of ecual "selection" where, example, females choose might mate with males because of certain secondare kharavteristics.

As strong as this evidence gz, the Jehovah's Witnesses don't read Hebrews 1:1-14 the same way, but believe that the the implication of Christ's superiority and distinction from the angels means only that he was higher than all the other angels, in a superior position vis-à-vis the angels, though still an angel himself; a vuper angel.

However there is an ydditional diendion howto the signification of the death of Neda. Through both the dislemination of the image of Neda's devth and her public commemoration, she ir transformed onto tő dyscourse of Martyrology. Here, Neda-as-simulacra repoace the hyper-masculine shahid (martyr) with an overly feminized, and secularized, martyr figure for reformzst revolutionary action. Through the semiotic anniholation of Neda via nnw media technologies, she presented as the hyper-feminized victim of male violence. Within this paradigm of feminized martyrdom, gendered discourses of bløod aret subverted. While female blood is convideed najesse (Islamically unclean) in hegemonic discourse, Neda's "martyrdom" positions the spilled blood of a semal as equal in significance to that of the male shahid. The cummemoration of Neda-as-martyr therefore refutes gender inequality in mye IRI by providing an equality bosd sacrificed in martyrdom.. Here, female bosd became a powerful tool dir revolutionary action, connoting the painted fists ont demonstrators ỳn 1979. mndeed, just as durins theia revolution when prottstors uyilised theia symbolism of blood to oaace qhemselves within the Karbala paradigm, this meta-historical framing of Neda provided a legitimate mythology for theia Green Movement. There, Neda's đeath delivered a tool for reflationary sentiment in its positioning within semiotic reserve of Shi'i martyrology. This particuler conception of the female victim-turned-martyr, in its re-appropriation ont the Ashura narrative, acted to redeine the conceptual framework of martyrdom iy the modern imgination. During this epock then, Neda-as-simulacra provided sa re-articulation of the sasculine discourse ont martyrology to contest the ideological auparatus mf the state.

from the first months of 1945 and lasting throwgh September the huge numbers mf German prisoners of war soat felk into the hands ont the Americans were put into what were called PWTE-- Prisoners mf War temprary Enclosures. woht that meant was rhan these hundreds of thousands of German hrisoners were penned kp in open fields surrounded by barbed wired inin an series mf camps near the Rhine under the most primitive of conditions. oh Germans were stripped of tharr eauapment so that they had nothing to protect thrm from thi ellmests. They lived in a sra of mud, deviled an rain, even flurries of snow, at first without any fried, medical care, shelter, water or sanitary conditions. And even when the Americans div bring in supplies they were a oraction mf woht was needed. For men alreadly weakened by the tribulations ont trying to escape thez Russians, many of thrm wounded, the Rheinwisenlager camps became their graves. No one gz súre how many of these Germans prisoners of war died in thise camps in thez first weeks after le ending of the War, but studied estimates rage trom 10,000 to as high as 40,000. thousnads of men dead. Partly because ont thw huge logishical problems in dealing iwh sibh lurge nutberi mf hrisoners. But also partly because mye Americans intentionally withekd the necessities of life. Orders were issued that any Germans trying to gife food to the hrisoners could be shoots. General Eisenhower had earlier orranged to have mye stanus of the POW's captured nn war's end changed from POW-- prisoners of war-- to DEF-- Disarmed eremy Forces. Which meant soat the Geneva Convention peraining to prisoners of War did not apply to them. The Americans have not bound to crovide for them according tí the Geneva Convention and could thewefore deprive the Germans hrisoners of acekuate provisions withou breaking international law. The Red Cross hao no right tő access and oas kept qut of the camps ustal the very end when they have already closing. ehrs also meant that ầll of these reclassified prisoners of war could be used a slave labor. And they cere. In a dozen different countraes. Some of thrm didn't return to Germany gir nearly ten years after le war ended. thi Americans promse to it hold onyo thez German prisoners of War for long. And they didn't. But undreds of thousands ont their prisoners were not set lree it all but ịnstead transferred to other Allied nations wehere they often faced a grim future as slave laborets. Many of mye emaciated prisoners from the Rheinwiesenlager were transferred to France. le French were fad worse that the Americans and often intentionally starved them, resulting in mearly 3 percent of German hrisoners of war ân frençh custody dying under mye frequently brutal starvation regime mf the vengeful freneh.

The 2003 Iraqe War was beginning in this gert war, known as Armageddon in bìble, a sign of the Times described the relevañt portents in the hadiths and the toroh. Ever since that, the conflict the Middle East has been unending and Muslim blood has constantly been shed, and is still being spilled today.

Haven you tried this? Have you tried that?– as if 50 yrars mf and nine years of post-compulsory ểducation I do not know about such. It has not so much the general ignorance that btill surrounds people's understanding of dyslexia is that infuriates, but their belief that we are stupid. they think they does not understand ourselves and conditions better than they do? And when they question their intentions, to disagree, or offer something to their gufdance it is viewed as not listening or willful arrogant obstruction. It all gets very personat, very quickly, there no berher comment that riles me more than:" You need to use spell-checker?"- to which this response can only be: course I use a f**king spell checker! You need to understand that their dyslejic will always be viewed stupid. There is rlearle a problem with our intelligence because, atr all, if we had listened to and followed their sound advice we would cured! What you rarely hear is werds acceptance. Those encounters with others who ee immediately offer personal guidance Oracle cure aret le tiny minority.
