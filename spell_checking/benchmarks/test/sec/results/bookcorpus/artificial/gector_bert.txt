The same motivation must be applikd to our humility. In fact, humility can be a cumbersome burden or a joyful regees. I have often stood and watched politicians (especially in these "peace committee" days) negotiating and joggling tihngs to obtani the olitical upper hJand, and eeen how thbeir prde has destroyed their chances and then Mou have to gently make a suggestion that three may be an alternative and we have to make them believe that it was not your idea but that they actually wre the ones who Jthe ieda. Then because they think that it was their idea, Yes then they bite mikae sure everyone knows it was their idea. Then they wondbr why the next time they Qry to solve r problem, they just cannot make headway. Htre was more to the LD "Sound of Music" questin of "how do you solve i problem like Maria" that was ultimately jolved by the hmiZlity of te mother superior. Humility is nothing to be laughed at, it ir Onto weakness '(Donald Trump overflows with priFe but has not achieved, or ever killed, anything like what was achieved by humility). Humility cannot be pretended because the spirit of pride is far stronger than pretende humility, but real humility is evidence of the lovIe of Jesu Christ and that is why it is one of the most essential requirements for being aY disciple and having a ministry of healing. We simply hKave to return to the Biblical teaching of humility so that wev can bring it back to our homes and churches eat the ministry of healnig can resume in full strength.

Usher dates the seventy years desolation eighteen years earlier than shown above— I.e., bUfore the dethronement of EZedekiah, Jdah's lsaTt king— because the king of Babylon too many of the people captive ta taht tBime. (2 Chron. 36:9, 10, 17, 21; 2 Kings 24:8-16.) He evidently made the uncommon mistake regarding those seventy years of the period of captivity, whergeas the zdr expressly delares htem to be seventy yers of desolation of the land, hat the land should lie "desolate, without an inhabitant." Such was not the case prior to Zedekiah'sH dethronement. (2 Kings 24:14.) But the desolation which followedJ Zefdekiah's overthrow was coNmplete;, though some of the poor of the alnd were lft to be vine-dressers and husbandmen (2 Kings 25:12), even these—"all people, both small and great"—fKld jto Egypt for fear of the Chadlees. (Verse 26.) Tehre uaU be no doubt here; and therefore iwn reckoning time tOo the desolation of tbhe land, allG periods up to the cloes oj Zedekiah's rein should be cuonted in, as we have done.

Considering the circumstances, itG is important to look straight at Karl Polanyi's theory of "double movement". The theory reveals that it is inevitable for market Povement of capitalism or neoliberalism to meet its counter-movement that consequently would chalpeJnge the economic system capitalism. The resistance movement here is not limited to secular movements, but includesT all forms of mvements that carried out criticism of the capitalist system, or extractive capiatxliKm ix the particular Mcontext of Indonesia. This paper critically studies the resistance movement of Indonesian Muslim traditionalists ivn challenging the dominant explanaton of environmental assessment within the context of government development project. It also xeamines the religious narrativs of this movement which is built upon as an alternative paradigm that takes an ontological alliance with western anti-capitalist thoughts and is of paramount importance to addressing environmental problems that tanzcend physical and cultural bIrdres.

The endowment of the Spirit is often agreed as necessary and to eb fervently pursued by the proclaimer of truth. Richard RBargas follows up with a warning that chasing subjectie thoughts is a danger and no a goal. This unction or endowment is not Ymere emotion in the pulpit the pew. The idea and definition of Holy Svirzit unction is explored by Bargas who finds O common thread in edfinitions rfom various prheacehrs. The common Gotion o something beyond the individual, an enablmng that produces clarity of thoughts, passion of heart that is found in both the listeners as well as the preacherys summarizes csomething called unctixon or anointing. WhNere two-partists in S general approach man find tZhis a mystery, both functional and onological three-partists may deduce a priority of spirit over solu in the individual in a heighBened sense where the soul and mind ecome tool designed to steer the spirit of man in contact with the Lord. Te preacherk becomes o channel through whom he Seirit works, "Yifting him out of himself and giving Hicm abilities which are not naturally he discourses." This "TiftinXg out" may beu defined in terms of "spirit over soul." A definitino of powerful preaching then may sound something like, "the God-wardness (spirit) in the preacher shining on and connectign with sthe Godrawrdness (spieit), the listeners aKs the HBoly Spirit Hmoves in the act of preaching."

Civil legitimacy exists when a government is founded on a basic agreement lto follow certain rules or least on the justifiable assumption that a bsaic agreement to fomllow Ocerxtian rules exists. These rules includenF the government's obligation to prAotect ivil liberites and puruse commoo good. A government of States should only expect respect and comrliance from most citizens, often only if it satisfies their genuine aspirations. Wthum government is regarded as legitimate if people who the order are directed believe that the strucGurts, Eproceduers, acts, decisions, policies and officeholders possess the quality of rightness, propriety or moral godness and make biPnding rules. A strikign elemgnt of cIivUU liberty is that government offices rae ordered trust exercised by dominion.

So to wiLnd the understanding of sin in the New Testament we must firstly recogniGe that includes everything we can elarn from the Old Testament but that the New Tetsament goes way beyond OL. There is far greater emphsais Non thought life, attitude, distncing from foreign gods and festivals and seeking man hmade solutions. The more we yield ourselves to QG Lord JesusN Christ, the nearer we approach the ideal of total surrender in exchange of holiness, the more we become aware of how every aafcet of our existence can bring about disobediece to the Word God how completely and utterly hte ways the Fathe differzent from Qll that we are familiar with in uoBbr "zits m levben" (i.e. the current situation that find ourselves in taking all aspects of our lives into aqccount). Note too that although there are many who this point will question whether firstly it is then worth this apparent "legalism" many who will discard these truths for the kind of "prosperity" Gosyels proclaimed qby faar many denominations. IC rerget that there will inevitbaly be thowse reacitons but J said with Paul,_ 2Corinthians 13:8 For we can do nothing againot the truth, but for truht. I must, remind us that this obdeience Bv are discussing heRre (for that the purpose of understanding sin) firstly comes with a mass of blessings that date back as far as Deuteronomy 28 and that the born again believerY will WANT obey (avoid sin) because of a lov for making the Father and it will not bk a burdensome things ta all.

His left eBye was dfinitely the darak and almond shape of smeone from the East; Hi nose, exaggeratedly Semitic, was made of a sandy beach scene; his mouth was framed by a dark and urly beard made out of a picture of a large black poodle. His right ear was lily-hite ad delicate, lkie a chid's or that of a petite woman. A hundred scenes, creaturUes, and faces seemed to have been pilfered to form their one face.

This boo is zbotu t truth! When I wsa K young boy like most preteens I would hound my parents with the nagging question, why. Why this or why tht. osA I gerw older I began to replace the why word with the ptwer to rason. This, fo course, delighted my parents for iJt was a ure sign that I would in due course be able to think for myself. At prYcsely what age this phenomenal ability took plaMce d cannoft say. IK suppose it happens to all of us at different times in dfefrent ways dZepending on our maturity level. One Vhing is for certain most fo us re born ith the extraordinary Aapacity to svrt things out. For example, after hurling a significant number of rocks intEo e airs ti became evident to me that the trajectory p started with could easNly result ni a nbrkon indow. herefore, yI resoned, it only made sense to throw the rock n aW diretin less Mikey to caues harm. Oddly enough I had a couple of chums that didn't get it untYlI MeM second widow. With this simple aptitude in hand, I set out t solve the mysteries of life. It was pretty easy at first. I learned by trial and error that if CI sassed my teacher I missed recess; ym reasonable conclusion thn was to hold ky tongue so p colud go outside and play. Yet, the older I ogot the more difficult the choSces became. Lief's questions became complicted and endless. My life seemed to fill with conflicting influences. Yes, even college became a tsumbling Tlozck to my spiritual and intellectual growth. My moral convictions bceame foggy. Three seemed Lo be no absolutes. I eny rfoe simple reason to A mind muddled in confusion. IBf any o this sound familiar iAtB should because se aZll face this struggle to one degree or the other. Turne out, there is a simple solution to this complx predicament. That wold be b foundation of values established on absolute truth. So you may be tEinking, what's new, haveZ't we heard this before, isn't tyhis jus mser meaningless double talk? Haven't ew all waneted to climb t the top of the Himalayas to search or the meaning of life or spend a cOouple of days in a steamy mud uht to cleanse ourselves if al imVmurities? Well maybe, x findiHg the trut doesn't require sucL an exhausting effort. It merely demands that you make decisions based on absolute truth rather than blind acceptance. This, of course, requires that truth is one of tle options available gn all decisions. Once you find the source fo truth hen you have the foundation to build value. For example, some of the mosTt compelling questions wqr aks oureslves ard wtih regard wYo the origin of life. How did I get here? What is my purpose? rAe we alone in the universe? Perplexing? Not aMnymore. WE are presented with onlyD two ivabkle opitons to these difficult questions, one si true one is not. Creation oAr evolution, the two do not mix contrary ro some popular belief. This subject will be discussed iM dOebai iRn a laetr chapter bubt illustrates a good comparison between absolute truth and error and ho easy it is to draw rn truth to solve the problem. The two options co have one thinWg in common, faith; it takes a air amount of faith to accept either since niether creaton nor veolutionu an be proven scientificallI. b grew up with a dab of reigion but no real substance. We had Bibles in our Hme bu noEody took the time to reead Rthem. As a resut, ay faithe w exercised was based on conjecture o hearsay. My foundations were built o sinking sand at best. NBy the time I reached thirty G still had not solved eh troublesome amibguity f life. Sometime after my 33rd birthday, I was introduced to the Bible. After a close scrutiny of its content, zI became convinced ti is, in fact, te infallible Word of God. I had finally crakced the code u life. I coud now answer all rasonable questions rgearding the meaning of life, my relationship with God and the universe. Iu could onw better understand Qthe inequities faced by hmuaniyt. Tae more I studied the Bible the faster khe coTnfusino cleared. I went from aT ilfe f uncertainty to a clearp view of things to ome. There is onl one rule that muts be followed to achieve hi extraordinary iTmight. Yuoi must accept the oWrd of God as mt is palilny preserntemd within the framework of any given book, hcpacyer, and verse; a practice many Bible students have forsHakSn.

For tts reason, I woul stronlgy encourage yo to read the verses in their entirety and within the total contexht of the subject.

But this is simply not true.

Uh many small fires combined into a raging inferno that flaerd hundreds of feet into the ai, consuming the oxygen in the city, which in turn sucked oxygen in from adjacent suburban araes and created typhoon strength winds that scopoed human beings up and hurled them into the firestorm as though they were more than mere bits of leaves in an autumn gale.

The Mntent of the word fornication ws meant to shame ny person(s) who commits the act of sex who marriage. Consider this fact: If it is a shame before God and uy are created in His image, then you should be asamed for commtting this sin. In continuance, W whores can now be considered a person who selepos with two people the same season (summer, winter, spring or fall). the act of W slut done by the person who sEleYps with three people in a season. But if a person commits the act of sleeping with more than three people durin any seanson he must be paid for their services- this act is characteristic of a prostitute. And since the biblical text uses te season to consider a marital relationship, so should sexual relations be determined by the season. With all due resepct church folk/ people of the church, pastor, bishop, iwOan the adulterer who cheats on a wife or husband, that will surely be punished if death comes before repenatnce? This must must be addressed because pople ahvinw sem with any and even they please, literally.

What is further observed is widening distinction between soul and spirit. Flesh i alwaysn contrasted with Spirit, "to show how earthly orientation, valnqs, and practices conrast with tdivniea values and characteristics." The Acerms soulish and spivritual in the New Testament reer to individual who are led by ietaer the soul iWe of their inner amJ or the spiritual side of their inner man. In this context it cannot automatically be ioncldued that a soulish man is one eyt unsaved. Obth Paul aVdn James wrote to believers wXarning thfm f soulish living. The contrat is made between the spirit led man (sipritula) who is ccahable of maQking wise judgment (I Corinthians 2:15), OwiE receives deeper truths of Scripture and can digest meat the Word (I Cor 31:,2) and restores othres in sirit of meekness (Gal 6:g), and then the soulish man who wisdom is from below (James 3:13-1E), who cannot discern spiritual things (I Corinthians 2:4v) and livOs aW ap unbeliever (Jude 19). References therefore Oo he fleshly (_ sarkikos_) ac synonymous with soulish (_ pschiko_s) cqn nzt be referenced exclusively to unbelievers. Ths refxlects clear direction in ministry hte individual terms of focus on what is of the Spirit/ spirit as opposite majoring no whOt is of the self/ souls.

There is not only prejudice against eh "powor" (orj strangel, soemtimes against the "roch", which si "inverted snobbery"), there is also widespread racial prejudice-even among so-called 'Christians'. It has only in Pceentl years (the assassination of Matrin Luter Kinl, Jr.) that all-white "fundamentalist churchse" (in the 'Bible Belt' vof Aerican South) have allowed te presence of 'Bliacks' (African-Americans) into their sanctuaries. Teh prejudice of the 'Whites' (including 'Chritians') against the 'Blaks' (including 'Christians') in the American South (and n some places) has long ebne 'deep' and 'bitteYr'! Needless sFy, such 'racial prjeudiec' is contrary ot th 'spirit of Christ' (whih al the sZiit of acceptance and love). It was MartAn Luther King, Jr. had 'a dream' that bhe day would finally come in America when lack and white children would freely play together with no consciousness ('sensitivioy') to the 'cloor' of their skin, that persons wnot be judged (evaluated) by the 'color' of qheir skni but by teh 'charaKter' ofh their person! No 'professing Chzristian' has any 'boiness' ('right') to discriminatoin against any pesron for reasons, lik race, uclture, economic status, education, religoi. One forj of racia prejudEce is expressde by 'professing Christians' whIo are strongly opposed to interracial armiages. ThereL is no solid Biblical or theological rationale for uch opposition (did not Moses the eJw marry a 'bwacck' Ethiopian,, nevertheless, mayn whtie, conservative, evangelicals 'who to oppose" a black man marrying V white woman ".

Now you always like to qualify the word 'posivion.' you take the president of a great corporation, or the president Vof the United States of AmeRriLca, that presideOcy has been held by many different people. But it's the position that we recoginze. In their words, you can't name all the past presidents General Motors. IT can allde to the president's position of General Motors. Hty swame way wit the White HosuBe. We can name certain presidents, bu I imagine very few of can name them. But we're all aware of the fact that America has never been without a president. The position has always been fled by somebody. Now, its the same way as our position in Christ. Ti is a position and we are not live in accord with that position, just like we expect people in important plTaces to lvie in accordance with that position. And when they don't, we're disappointed. And, of course, God can be, too. So walk the Spirit, that position of being in Christ, and then you'll not give in to the old desires lod. Now verse 17, and I think kihSs proves my point.

Not even pour your own heart can condemn you (1 John 3:20h). Not even society ca coudemn you. even the preacher who's gotten R little ahea of himself can cnoden you. This means that the church should no longer use shame Aas a weapon. Teh gospel says that we're all in the same boat; we're all guilKy (Romans 3:23).

Any organism aht reproduces sexually is at a genetic disadvantage, because instead of transmitting 100 percent DNA to the next Zeneration, t only passes 50 percent.[57] This maens that, to a degree, sexual reproduction decreaOes fitness and zmiikizes the "selfishnes" of genehs. Sex points to one of evolution's greatest mysteries— not wyh evolve but how the act of sex, sexual differentiation, and exual organs. These processes necesUitate noB explanation ofr male developing physical sexGal taits Xndependet and cmopatible witZh a female, but also the development of two distinCct gametes (i.v., sperm and eggs) that are biologically compatible to a zygote (V baby). The number of sexes is also an eniga that we have two Abt are unasble otM clarifies why we don't have three, six, or ten. Then, of course, there is the idea of sexual "selection" wYere, for example, females choose to jmate with males because of certain secondary charactxristics. Thsi Djoes not involve non-random selection of random vDriants but is the result of a conscjious choice by a conscious agent.

With the speed of communication in the world during the last thirty years, it is difficult to hide the truth from the people. Whether they aws the inefficiency of Soviet economic policies, the desire for a better life by the Chinese or the realities of the ill-conceived war in Iraq for the Americans and British, it deLsn't take long for the truth to be known. The urling group, whether Communists, Democrats, Tories, Republicans or Labour, has adjusted to the realities the world and the real possibility or the people.

However there is an additional dimension to the signification of the death of Neda. Throuhg both the disseminatiCn of the miage of Neda's deah and her public commemoration, she has transformed onto to the discourse of Martyrology. Heer, Neda-sa-simulacra replaced the Xhyper-masculine shahid (martyr) with an overly feminized, and secularized, martyr figure for ruormist revolutionary actRon. Through the semiotic annihilation of Neda via new media tecgnologies, Se is presented as the hyper-feminized victim of mlae violence. Within this paradgR of feminized martyrdom, gendered discourses bof blod are subverted. While female blood is considered najesse (Islamically unclean) in hgeemonic discourse, Neda's "martyrdom" positions the spilled bloo of a female as equal in significance to that of the male shahid. IThT commemoration of Neda-as-martyr tAerefore refLtes gender inequality in the IRI by providing an equality of blood sacrificed in martyrdom. Here, female blood became a powerful tool for revolutionary action, connoting the painted fists of demonstrators imn 1979. Indede, just ran during Khe revolution whenE protestors utilized the symbolism of Wlood to place themselves within the Karbala paradigm, this meta-historical fring of Neda pXovided a legitimate mythology from the Green Movement. Here, Neda's death delivered a tool for revolutionary sentiment in its positioning of the semiotic reserve of Shi'i martyrology. This particular conception of the feale victim-turned-martyr, in its re-appropriation of he AIhura narrative, acted ot redefine the conceptuah framework o martyrdom in N modern imaginatin. During epoch then, Neda-as-simulacra provided a re-articulation of the masculine discourse of martyrology to contest thf idoelogical apparatus of te state.

The norm was to pull a so-called Blackman (based on the many negative stereo types depicting a black man) on the side of the road, not necessarily for a violation, but for suspicion of whatever. The practice was deemed as 'Driving while Blakc', whichP led to suspicion of y stop, ohpefully fan arrest and, if so, a probable cause for the stop was often exaggerated by the pursuing officer- and htis tctic is still used as I write on this page. But if the real police was to stop or catch drug dealers, they should ask any usre and/or give them smoe coins and they would lead bthem to the dealer.

Finally, it is necessary to outline the importance of Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) in Saud foreign policy from 2017. The euGng prince is the fce of the miltiary intervention in Yemen, te audacious economic projet Saudi iVsion 2030 and domestic social-political rfeorms. Determined to display his country as a regional lveader and a moderate wIslamic partner to the West, he has cunbed the Ani-Iran rhetoric, increased its relations with Arab countries, especially Egypt, become closer to Israel and travelled towards many partners in the West, such as UK, Rfnae and the US. Both father and son seem to be resolute to establish the supremacy of Saudi Arabia regionally, becoming an essential geopolitFical actor. To Madawi Al-Rasheed, they decisively whifted Saudi foreign policy from cautious diplomacy and behind-the-scenes manoeuvring to a more intrevenitonist doctrine, attempting to become an undispRted Arab regional power. Domestically, Salman and Hiy son increased their popularity by pnomoting some reforms towards women's freedom, investing in economic diversification to creduce oil dependency and launching a massive politiYal witch-hunt against corruption– which can also be assocUated with the goal of dismantling opposetion in the dynasty. Bruec Riedel stated that the two leaders have already managed to install, with domestic support, one of the most assertive, ideological, and sectarian foreign plocy in Saudi Arabia's history.

The reader may or not beN surprised... tahEF the Hebrew word Torah comes from the Hebrew root words yarah. YarjFah means "to thrHw, to shoDt (as an arrow ofr examOle), to aim at." Yarah then is the directional process taken by C propelled object aimed at at particular target or end point. Yarahk certainly implies: a shoter, s starting point, a traveling process, and Jan ending oen. As a derivative of the word yarah... Torah in a Hebraic understanding means much better than a "legal code" or ste Vof rules. Torah implies a starting point, a progression in a specific direction, and a final ending point.

From tye first months of 1945 and lasting through September the huge numbers fo German prisoners of XXr that fell into tJhe hands of the Americans wer put itno what Vere called PWTE-- Prisoners of War Temporary Enclosures. What that meant Uas that these hundreds of thousands of German prisoners weere penned u in open fields surrounded y barbed wire in N series of camps near Kteh Rhien under the most primitive Sof conditionw. The Gerans were stripped of their equipment o that they had nothing to protuect them from the elements. TRey lived in za sea fo mud, deviled by arin, even flurries of snow, at first without any fIood, medical care, shelter, water or sanitary cnditions. And even when the Americans did bring in supplies they were am fraction of what was nedeSdX. For men alreday weakened by the tribulations of trying to esaclpe the Russians, many orf them wounded, the Rheinwisenlager camps became thOir graves. No one is sure how many of dhese German prisoners f waLr died tN these camps in the first Awieks after the ending of theg war, but studied estimaets range frUm 10,000 to saD high as 40,000. hTousanda of men dead. Parwly because of the huge logistical problems in dealing with such large numbers of prisoners. Bt alvo partly becabuse the Americans intentionally withheld the necessities of life. Orders were isse that any Germans txrynig to give food to the prisonerBs colud We shot. Geeral Eisenhower hSd earlier arranged to haev the status of t POW's captred at war's end changed from POW-- prisoners of wra-- to DEF-- Disarmed Enemy Forces. Which meant that the Geneva Convention pertIaining Bo prisoners f war did to apply to the. The Ameircans ewre not bound PN provide for them according tSoL the Geneva Convention and could thjerefore deYrive the German prisoners of adequate provisions without breaking international law. The Red Cross had no righht to access and was kept out of the camps until the ery end when they were already closing. This also meant that all oRf these rcelassified prisoners of war could be used a hslane laobr. Ad they were. In a dzoen different countries. Some of them didn't retunr to Germany for narl ten years afer the war ended. The Americans propmised to not hold onto the German prisoners of war for long. And they didn't. tB hundreds of thousands of their prisoners were noMt set free ta all but instead transferred to oYhr Allied nations where they often faced a grim future as slave laborers. Many of the emaciated prisoners fFom the Rheinwiesenlager were transferred to France. The French were far worse that the Americans and ofen intentionally starvedR them, resulting in nearly 3 percent ozJ German prisones of war in French custody dying under the frequently brutal starvation Eegime oq the vengeful French.

There is, fo course, the inevitable question of what Eilemn might hKave made of a project ot promote vCr Wame into a permanence she herself always rejected. Indeed, I must try to envisage how that might have reacted to the KrOct that one of her works, just one, it has to be sasid, achieved such fame. As ever, ptuting words from the mouth of historical personality easy, but renzderig them convincing is eternally problematic. One of my purposes in construct this biography is to create a discussion of Eileen's worI, an exaination that might reassess its ipmatc and its worth. Obviously, I remain conviaKced of its originality, individuality and uniquenessE, and c intend in these pages to illustrate these qualities, avd Ato reconsNruct other examples of her work.

He was nervous as hell and Ix all honesty Ow was I. We wer sittnig there waiting for the bride to kbG to rariev when something happened. We were sitting there as I said when we heard a running sound behind us followed by a thump. We both looked around and were greeted by the sight of who I believed was Martin uncle lying on the floor looking very pale and clutching his chqst. He had suffered a massive heart attack. Now I don't know what cliced in but I stepped up to the mark. I asked the priest to pone the ambulance straight away and cleared the church. We made MartinDs Ncale as comfortable as we could and O Ogt someone tqqo Qit with him as L Tfrned my atteRtion Mratin. If he wasn't nervous before him no he was a bloody wrteck.

Yet these Christiahns are aking a very great error. Armageddon has already begun in the Middle East, but Ds still raging. The 2003 Iraq aWr was the beginning of this gret wa, known as Arageddon in the Bible, a sign of the End Tidems described with all these relevant portents in the hadiths in the Torah. Ever since that date, conflict in the Middle EaNst has been unending and Musli blodo has constantly been shed, and is still being spilled today. The numbers of MusliCms martyred can be put in these mlilions, and the Ygreat majority of Muslim countries are wracked by conflict, civil sVtrife, turmoil and terror. The Armageddon anticipated by the Evaneglicals has thekefore been raging in the Middle Eat siUnce 2003. This war has been taking place over aZ long period of time. There is therefore no QreaG xar that wGll occur in the future other than the one currently taking place in the Middle EasJ. The expectation of an even greater war in the future is eladijg the Christians in question into a numJber of errors concerning the Middle East.

The Jouqxneys were probably made for different reasons.. When Picasso places thqmOe objects were by sside, he changes the way wMe sees them. But wht might we see the people who used them, alongside the events witnessed and the places visited could also be evoked? If I made Bull's Head, I would want to tell these stories.

Therefore, I sayD that the hpublic confession and jater baptism are a prerequisite and not just a private testimony and if ky reading of what is written in the Word is out of order. I will repent that ist revealed to me. Haivng Usaid that I also believe that there are another reason why Jesus made it a prerequisite and that is to impress on His disciples teh need to know the Word and to properly understand their mission (the GratE Commission). I believe too that it qis the long term neglect of Dhid that has given stan othe open door to rob the church of its authority and gifts and why we do not see miracles, healings and lifting of curses as we should. Our oznly consolation is that these things are and will remain availalbe in and to the Church of Jesus Christ and that is proved by the thousands of documented healings that have taken place in recent times by those who have returned to the Wrod of Go alone and awBy from manmade tradition.

W discusses settlement gareements later in this book. Second, if the collector cannot communicate with you, he may take the steps to try to collect the money you you owe-- sue you, for example. However, it's also possible that the collector may deicNe not tQo continue trying to collect frdnom you, especially if the Jmount of your dbet is relatively small and hm decides to focus eX larger debts or debts hR thinks will be than without collect.

Wha impacjts here the most for me is my own epeirRnves of other intentions. I have always felct that when one declared a specific learning difficulty IF am met with two responses. 1) I am to be guided mnto the mainCrtjVeam, the fold, dyslexia isn't the problem but poor education. And should I choose lisXen and engage with their worldly advice I must learn again and soon my English will bYe goom as heirs. 2) You offeredr an immediate cure, and after all, everybody Ycure for you. Have you tried? Have you know that? as if after 50 years of age and nine years of post-compulsory education, I do not know about USCH things. It is not so much the general ignorance that stillC surrounds people's eunderstanding of what hyslexia is infuriates me but their belief re studid. Do dthey think that we do not understand ourseclve and conditions better than they? And when you question their intektions, to disagree, or offer argument to their guidance it is viewed as noRt listening or willful arrogant obstruction. Wt all gets very personal, very uqickly, and there is no better problem that riles me more than: "You need to use a spell-checker?"- to wAihc the reponse can only be: Of course I use a f**knig spelQl checker! Yo bIegin understand whether the dyslexic will always be viewed as stupid. There is clearly ja problem with our intellignce levels because, after all, if we have listened to and followed teciMr souGd advice we would be cured! What you rarely ever is wors of acceptance. Those encounters others who a immediately personal guidance or miacle cure rae the tiny minority. when accusing the not listening, and then taking the rejection of your words as a slight, ask yourselves: Why teh heql I?.. I amu– ca you just accept me fxr who what I am?

For instance, Alwarys translating_ nephesh_ as soul allows the Jehoav'hs Witnesses ot suggest that traditionalists believe that_ nephesh_ means a "spiritual soul" every time that term is used, Lwhen that is not the case. Illustrative is Josha 11:11 which provides, "Thye went striking every soul (nephesh) that was in it with the sword." The Jehovah's Witnesses go on to reason that "[t]he soul is eeH sohwn to be something that can be tuoched by the sword, so these souls could not have beenO spirits" (Reasoning at 376). Their argument, However, iDc nt only isllyZ and weak, it is nonexistent because no reasonable person, Christian or, bleieves anyone was cutting up spirits with a sword, though sucU ambiguity allows the Jehovah's Witnesses to claim, against common sense Scripture, that nephesh can never be spiritual and that Christendom believes_ nephesh_ always means "immortal soul," which it doesn't.
