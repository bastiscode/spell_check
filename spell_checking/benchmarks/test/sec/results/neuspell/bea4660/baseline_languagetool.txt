after a few seconds of thought i went straight to pat. "why, why did you do that?"
i tought that any brook, who is my favorite actor, would perform in that show.
and when we understood the internet, wet ought that meeting people from other countries and being able "to chat" with them was the height of technology.
as you know, we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle, and wet ought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country!
i tought i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
i also like surfing. i think it is a dangerous sport, but i know how to do it, because last year a professional surfer thought me.
not only was i a member of the swimming team in our school, but also i had been thought by my father since i was five years old.
as regards painting, i know a lot about it since my grandmother thought me when i was five years old.
i met a lot of different people and they all thought me something new about behavior or compassion.
they thought me specially.
lastly, there is a recycling problem, with many people do not care about.
firstly, the great boom in mass communication with happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
i'd seen your advertisement with recommended the play 'over the rainbow' and i liked it very much.
there are the natural materials on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produces more and more synthetic materials, with relay on the production cost.
my main work was to take people to their seats because of a concert hall, with was the millennium dome.
therefore i am thinking of selling my car, with has changed my life over the last 10 years, with has given me a kind of freedom, with has gone with me to all sorts of fantastic places, and changed my life for a new life: without a car.
for example, recently i was shopping at the market, with is located in the center of our town.
from the list of activities in with i will have a chance to compete i have chosen basketball and swimming.
we live surrounded by inventions with help as through the day.
to summarize, the modern technologies give you and allow you to do many things with would be impossible in the past but also creates many problems.
actually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion on with this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
finally in my opinion i with we would dress more as we did in the past, using natural material. we must think more about the environment and live closer to nature.
i with that my accommodation at camp California it must be in a tent.
i hope you will enjoy the visit and i with you a nice holiday in Vernon.
travelling in July, i have to say, would be perfect for me because my birthday is on the 24th of that month and i with to spend my birthday in the best way possible, so that means there.
it was my dream. i with my daddy
i received a paper in which i was told about a play you are putting on and of the advantages i would get if i went to see it. i with that had never happened.
everybody will wear anything he/ she likes, choosing clothes from any century they with without this being strange.
however, there was one person who told me he wasn't happy at all with the phone, because he used to write a lot, especially at Christmas when he wanted to with all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phones him, ending a very old tradition.
some people use them in their work, others with to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the possibility of movement.
on the whole, being rich and famous doesn't always bring happiness, whereas the majority of the population with they were rich and famous.
i with you had been here with me.
the whether had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
about accommodation at camp California, i would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the whether is really good and when i am in a tent i feel closer to nature.
we thought that with that beautiful whether the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the whether is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
july is also good because the whether is warm and i could enjoy the time i will spend in the camp more.
finally, what kind of whether is waiting for us?
i would like to know how the whether is in California during the summer so i can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing i need to know is the amount of money that i have to bring with me.
how is the whether in California?
i wonder if you could tell me about the whether and what kind of clothes i ought to bring with me.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of whether it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
in japan, i often play golf but as you know Japanese whether conditions are not good enough for enjoying playing golf, but California has good whether, which means sunshine every day, hopefully.
i would like to ask you about the whether conditions, so i can decide on what clothes to take, and about costs, so i can make a budget for the holiday.
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, please can you tell me about the normal whether for this period?
in the future we won't buy clothes according to size or even color. our clothes will adapt to our bodies, the whether, our fit, all our needs.
'as i have a choice i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on whether conditions.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theater that it promises much more than the people can get for their money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back-my bank account number is enclosed.
i would like to ask whether you have competitions or different activities.
in your letter, you asked me whether the book i've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether there is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
first, the advertisement i got placed emphasis on Danny brook's starring in the show, but actually, a disappointing, unknown actor played his part, and i wonder whether he had real skills.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theater that it promises much more than the people can get for their money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back-my bank account number is enclosed.
i would like to ask you how much money i need, how the weather is, in order to pack the necessary clothing, and whether i need anything else.
finally, i would like to ask you whether there is anything i should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
from my point of view it depends on us whether shopping will be enjoyable or not.
wheather there is a phone, a fax or e-mail so i can be in touch with my family.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between these two i'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
in addition, i need to know whether meals are included or not with the accommodation so that i can decide how much i must have with me.
finally, i would like to ask you whether i have to prepare any special clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me.
could you please tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
do you recommend me to take only summer clothes or some wine clothes as well?
i would like to travel only in July because i would be on school holidays then and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in wine.
i would like to know if it is necessary for me to bring some money, and if we will have time to visit the city. about the clothes, do i have to bring some wine clothes?
i'm the wine of the first prize in your competition and i'm writing to you to give you some information which was requested by you.
i am writing to answer your invitation which i have received as a first prize wine.
at first i couldn't believe that i was a wine
i came to London for a short holiday to meet new people and to have a last of English culture.
there will be clothes for everyone's last.
this is because people won't give up the great last of food. although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two.
i've always wanted to last the freedom that birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumping in my veins, full of adrenaline, to let myself free, to shake from excitement.
there are also many kinds of take-away restaurants, where i can last my favorite foods.
i took a driving-theory last last October and i passed it and i will take a practical driving last very soon.
i took a driving-theory last last October and i passed it and i will take a practical driving last very soon.
i only put the speakers in the right places, or helped the engineers last the lights.
it took a long time to last the speakers and the microphones.
there were hundreds of Thai students waiting to take this last.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (i am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choice).
there are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficult.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
and i think that i made the right choice of profession-it is the perfect combination: a very progressive form of modern technology, and the most important thing-it is extremely interesting to me!
but after i climbed two steps more, my right foot slipped. i nearly fell, but luckily my hand caught a rock. it was dangerous, but i didn't have any choice. finally i did it.
it's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them i like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if i have to make a choice, i choose climbing and surfing.
for activities, my first choice is basketball. i have been playing it since i was nine years old.
i think that the best choice for you is to take the 234 bus.
secondly, my choice is the accommodation in tents. i think it could be more interesting. i could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside. in my opinion if i choose the log cabin it will be like being at home.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i think i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favorite and skillful hobby: sailing.
you wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? i think this is the best choice for him!
since i have a choice of accommodation, i'll definitely go for the log cabin, because i can't bear the heat inside a tent.
he wasn't Danny brook, one of the reasons for my choice of coming to see over the rainbow.
my second choice is golf.
my other choice is painting. i have been painting since i was ten years old. i used to go to special classes and i don't mind if you need me to help in the class.
this choice doesn't give many artists the opportunity to express themselves.
the reason for my choice of singing is that i feel embarrassed about my voice, so maybe i could improve it.
it offers a wide choice of courses from cooking, computing, make-up, languages, geography, to culture and civilization.
'as i have a choice i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions.
as regards accommodation, i would choice to stay in tents.
about the accommodation, from the two options, i choice to sleep in a tent, because i think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.
the other one i would choice is basketball because i'm tall and very fast with the ball.
as you already know, i am trying to become a professional photographer, consequently i would choice photography as the first activity and painting as the second.
it would be great if we could choice swimming and golf.
and regarding the activities, i must choice photography and painting because i am not very good at sports and i think i do well at these things.
i am not very good at painting, but i choice it because it is a good opportunity to do it.
the answer is that we choice the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundred other people.
i really think you should choice this one for her, it does go with her personality.
and my answer to the question about which activities i would like to choice, well i choice swimming, because it is my daily exercise, and surfing.
next year, you should calculate or examine how many people will come before you choice a hall, which i feel very good was plays and films.
secondly, my choice is the accommodation in tents. i think it could be more interesting. i could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside. in my opinion if i choice the log cabin it will be like being at home.
it would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could choice what you want to wear by pressing buttons.
with regard to the activities you offer, it is difficult to choice from such a huge variety, but i prefer to do those i know better such as climbing.
from the 10 options that i have to choice from i will choice two, climbing, which i have been doing for three years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
finally, i must choice travelling there in July because i am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work.
secondly, i would like to choice a tent for accommodation, because i have never spent time in a tent, that's why, i think it is a good opportunity for me.
i don't really worry about the accommodation at camp California, but if i can tell you which one i prefer i'll choice to stay in a tent.
at the camp i would like to choice two activities, painting and singing. i love painting. at university i studied art for two years, but now i don't have much time to paint because i work in a bank and i have a baby.
what i most appreciated was that they gave me their latest CD with their signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, i've given one to you.
the history of the human race is the history of world conquest. that said, technology has advanced continuously since the beginning of man's evolution. furthermore, during the last two centuries, there has been an enormous technological explosion. while the xix century gave us the steam engine, factories and the electric light bulb, this century has given us nuclear energy (and sadly atomic weapons), the computer, the internet and television.
i took lots of pictures, asked for autographs and i even gave them my cell phone number!
they also gave me a ticket to watch the concert live.
pat gave me some advice and i decided to have an operation.
i thought i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
for all these reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my money back.
i met all the staff, and Ricky took lots of photographs with me and gave me an autographed record.
i got into the car and gave the jewelry in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
the concert was planned for the following Friday, which was the day after my teacher gave me my marks.
he also gave me his address and telephone number if i need help from him in the future.
in answer to your question, i will have to say that i can only go to the camp in July because of my job; they only gave me that month off.
firstly, the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
i gave information about correct ways to other places like toilets and medical points.
some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously, maybe just a bit too seriously. they gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or members of other gangs, trying to start fights with them.
nearly at the end of this letter i have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price.
i quickly became bored by this hypocritical attention they gave me.
she was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a trade center there.
your advertisement was excellent and it gave me a lot of enthusiasm.
thirdly, i have chosen sailing and photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favorite hobbies and i have been enjoying sailing and photography for several years so i am quite good at both of them.
can you believe it, it was Moby. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he gave me a t-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything, thank you.
i'd prefer it if you gave me this information as soon as you can.
as a student, the low-priced ticket certainly attracted me a lot and gave me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists.
i am writing to you in order to gave you some details you asked me for in your letter.
can you please gave me some recommendations about the clothes i will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget.
before we can gave our opinions on this statement we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing.
to cut a long story short, because of everything i have said above, the correct thing for me to do is to ask for my money back, and for you it is just to gave it back to me because of all the trouble and disappointment you have made me suffer.
i want you to gave me back my money. i hope that in future you will correct all these mistakes.
the aim of this report is to gave some information about the new Acapulco resort buildings which were built 10 years ago. they are some of the first buildings that were built with the latest technology and designed by an important Mexican architect.
i would be very grateful if you could gave me some additional information.
with reference to your letter which i received yesterday, i would like to gave you some details about the international student conference, also the accommodation and activities that are planned during this week.
i and my friends would be obliged if you would gave us back some of the money we paid.
the first part, the chairman and a few guests will gave a speech and the second part, the participants will evaluate themselves, and the last part will consist of dinner and drinks.
because of this, the least you can do for us is to gave me my money back and work hard so that this theater, which is famous for its beauty and punctuality doesn't become famous for its disorganized shows.
in wars sailors communicate with mobile phones though places to place to get or gave information about themselves and the enemy.
please, when you receive this letter gave me a call so we can arrange everything.
i am writing to you to gave you some required information.
marine's real father wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to gave her back because they loved marine so much.
in the end, i asked for i money back (and payment for my horrible night): do you think anybody will gave me something back?!
i'm writing to you to gave my opinion of that great festival you organized last 21 and 22 of November.
sometimes they gave up, before they get something,
finally we should gave some information also about our tourism, business and computer courses.
plus, i got an autograph from a popular singer. i'll gave you the autograph as a present.
i was enthusiastic about receiving your letter. i will gave you all the necessary information.
by contrast, in the future, i guess we would rather go back to the ancient time, owing to have natural lifestyle. we will be unwilling to gave housework away.
i had not any money for travelling and my parents were going to gave me some only if i had concrete plans.
regarding the accommodation, i would be pleased to stay in a tent, because this reminds me of my holidays with my family.
thank you for giving me this opportunity.
finally, food shops should be added to this festival next year because only plays and films were not attractive enough to get audiences.
thise modern technology gets closer between person to another person, get close between worldwide, so that, this modern technology changed our daily life so different.
i would like to thank you once again for this great opportunity.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money that i'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
so this is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in this show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from make-up artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
but after this servile work i met Eminem.
your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracies; this show did not start at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15.
furthermore you can play with the computer, and unfortunately this fact especially has changed my life.
i'd like you to send the money to this address: UL tallow 10
i'm very happy about this because i spent most of my school life playing sports, especially basketball.
i am really looking forward to this holiday.
in conclusion, i can say that this is not the biggest problem that the world has and-- it is not my problem because i am not famous!
i think this topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view, because we can study the subject's reactions before, during and after shopping.
thise story happened two years ago.
that is very nice that all costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the u.s.a. and please tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change this activity.
i'm writing this letter to complain about the musical show i saw during my stay in London.
it said in the leaflet that this would be a perfect evening out, while it was not that at all.
now then, how was this advertising, it was completely different. i am really disappointed with your musical. i am asking you for my money back, because i didn't enjoy your musical.
we would like to ask if we could go to this show on the 15th march instead of doing the visit to the science museum.
some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing, that all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well.
it was great that you organized the arts festival in this city, because people really need this kind of social activity here.
if you have this opportunity one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like this just to get a free pass.
i am very keen on photography so i definitely will choose this as one of my activities at the camp.
in this book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we want something, we can get it, it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it.
in conclusion, the advertisement promised this would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so i would like to ask for my money back.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
i remember when i had the first lesson at the university and the teacher took us to the computer center and i saw these machines, all my colleagues and i were laughing was very difficult to imagine how you can work with this kind of computer.
what kind of an organization do you call this, sir/ madam?
now, it is already possible to send our shopping list by computer, and this option, in the next few years, will become the most common one.
firstly, the environment is polluted because of technology, although this is our fault.
anyway, in families they usually have this problem that when they buy a new one, suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
i do not have words to express how happy i am. i would like to thank you and camp California for this opportunity.
you wrote an advertisement saying that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit this concert, but there were artists from only 6 countries.
i prefer this accommodation because i think it's easier to meet people when you stay in a tent, near them, than when you stay in a log cabin.
the rest of the activities were very interesting for us, we learned a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people, and all of this without being expensive. i think that the ticket was excellent for us because of its price.
i asked some people in town and this was the best place to choose.
so this is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in this show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from make-up artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
and finally, i would have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought i would go to 'theater restaurant'.
in this letter you ask me for some further information for my convenience for this trip.
finally, i would like to ask you whether there is anything i should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
i am really surprised for the information because i won, and i would like to say thank you for everything. thise is why i wrote and sent this letter with the information you need i can only travel in July because it is the only time when i can do it before for my work i do not really care what accommodation i will have. i would prefer to come in July i will be available for the moment. i would really appreciate it if you could tell the people who work at camp California i choose the golf and photography because i think i am really interested in those subjects. i am not really really good but i have some experience.
you wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? i think this is the best choice for him!
thise is something i will never ever forget.
i think that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it isn't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event, and with this ticket you can visit everything you want.
in this letter you ask me for some further information for my convenience for this trip.
the aim of this report is to describe the biggest building of our town.
i am writing this letter to complain about your advertisement for the musical show "over the rainbow", which is misleading in a number of ways.
i made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha's friends with a note: "do not tell Agatha about this. thise is a surprise party for her. please keep the secret!" pat arranged a great DJ and drinks.
we started to put everything on the stage and after this ewe realized that the band was coming onto the stage near us.
i am very disappointed with this evening and with this disorganized way of dealing with problems so i am asking for my money back.
thise is because i intend to take an examination in September.
nowadays, in the year 2000 we still practice this ancient art but in a different way, we don't use weapons for hunting animals in the jungle, we use the remote to hunt TV shows, and we do not collect vegetables any more, we go shopping.
i would be grateful if you could include this show in your program.
after all of this ewe saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
people are getting more and more addicted to this, because it helps to make everyday life easier and more comfortable.
most of the time he gets lost, or they start playing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... and when this happens you get in a bad mood and you'll have a bad day shopping.
thise was the best part because when everyone was gone, billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginners!!!
the man said it was ok this time and we got in quite easily, we'd made it.
the modern technologies mean i am able to listen the music i've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if i buy a reproduction, i can carry this music everywhere.
in this book, Heathcliff as a child wasn't a bad character, but the situations he lived through with the earns haw family, where he grew up, made him rude, aggressive and noisy.
in addition to this, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
secondly, another problem was the starting time. according to your advertisement, the play starts at 19.30 but instead it started at 20:15, this is almost an hour's delay.
thise story happened a long time ago.
maybe you think i am exaggerating but recent studies prove that this mania can be really dangerous.
in fact, this activity seems to be very interesting.
when we saw your advertisement for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediately decided that this would be a perfect evening out.
i decided to go to see this show because of its stars, but on the day i saw it, a different actor performed.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find there.
thise book helps us to improve our logic, mind, and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much.
in fact, i expect a full refund plus compensation for the dissatisfaction suffered. i trust you will give immediate attention to this letter and i look forward to receiving a satisfactory response by return of post within a week.
i used this equipment during the concert, but i was so complicated system.
although i cannot explain any more about the thing i felt during the concert in this letter, i'd like to recommend you to help at a pop concert.
thise part had to be saved for later because the concert organizer wanted to know the exact number of visitors.
there is only one bad thing, that this festival was too short.
we really appreciate your organizing a very nice program, which has been organized by you this time.
the musical should have begun at 19:30, but it started at 20:15; this is unacceptable!
i am writing to reply to your letter in which you told me i won first prize in your competition, which is two weeks. i was very happy with this result since i did not think i could win.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
one of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes. our school is now the best in the country in all ages. we are rest with this. we can show what we doing order to be the best.
to make this report easier and faster, it was necessary to make a questionnaire which was given out in the school.
i appreciate this shops for lots of products, cheap prices and big spaces.
i am very indignant because i wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so i would like you to return my money and take note of all this problems.
in answer to your question, i wouldn't change anything because i think that this are the minimum rules that a teenager has to have to be responsible in the future.
definitely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under this circumstances i really believe you should give me my money back.
well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all this reasons i demand to have my money back, i wasted £20 to see a show which doesn't respect the program i paid for.
who got married, who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable change in his complexion, this are questions that most journalists are interested in.
all this years i believed that my father was killed in a car accident.
i was really astonished by all this shopping centers, like Asia, home base, etc.
and regarding the activities, i must choose photography and painting because i am not very good at sports and i think i do well at this things.
thise are only my immature views. if it is considerable for you, i will be very pleased. thank you very much.
if you break one of this rules you could be expelled for a week, a month or forever.
now, you just need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city, with a car, airplanes, shops, all this things without lights.
i might say that i am really good at swimming and sailing because i have been doing this kinds of activities for five years and i have had a really good training in water sports.
i will always say thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the machines which do the washing and the washing-up, before this, women spent a long time doing this tasks.
because we are living a computerized life, we'll be able to do most things at home or this flats'll have this places as well.
i have chosen this activities because this days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favorite hobby.
although, i would have felt better if i had a discount on my ticket, as you mentioned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, this couldn't possibly be given either!
the long queues, crowded places, high prices, sales, all this things combined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it.
thise actors appeared forty-five minutes late according to what is written in your advertisement.
when i was a child i was afraid of all this little insects that live in the ground and this fear still remains now.

apart from that i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between this two i'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.

thise inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared, but not everyone believes it is really so.
it seems to me that all this failures were your fault, because you were responsible for the organization of the show.
besides that the most important thing is that this children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got psychological problems and they are useful in society.
so i hope the world reaches agreement about this and computer engineers have to prevent this problems because something good could be something very dangerous.
in this galleries there are historical paintings and antique furniture which Chiang used.
all this items of equipment are applications of modern science.

thise days we can use a computer, television and some sophisticated equipment, which were unusual once.
for all this reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my money back.
regarding the activities i would like to choose swimming and climbing for my activities at the camp; i usually do this two activities on the army camp. i know how to climb up on racial outside and help other people to climb up.
the activities i would like to do during this two weeks are basketball and swimming.
because of all this inconveniences, i ask you for a total refund.
not only this subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, biology and physical training, but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects.
but this days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
i have chosen this activities because this days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favorite hobby.
and because of this circumstances, i would like to have a part of my money back.
in my opinion the hall for the rock concerts was too small. you have to consider booking a bigger one for next year because this kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people.

during this past few decades, or rather in the 20th century, there has been a great deal of development in modern technology.

maybe it would be a nice idea to analyze this changes and to put limits on technology, because i think that the most important thing is to understand our life and know the ways we can improve it.
technology, are we prepared for this advances?

thise days the computer is part of your life, you use it all the time. sometimes you do personal and other times it is just the things you need to do like go to the bank, use transport, go shopping etc. it is a machine that makes life easy and endow you can carry it everywhere. it is amazing the way as the FAS the computer changes, the programs are faster and more useful and practical.
all this products of science are with me from the very beginning of my day.
thise are some points i want to mention the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
because of convenience, we can use our time more effectively, but we should not rely on this things too much.
thise days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centers, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of money.
they are just like alcoholics and this people go shopping every day because they cannot stop themselves unless they have not got money to spend.
only those who get good marks can take part in this activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.

ther are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that the were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
ther were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also the rare plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and the rare too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance the was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
english: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time the.

on vide other should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that the can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, the were none.
first, the rare quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, the was only one hour left to install the different colored lights; it was just enough time.

when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to bet her and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, the was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, the were only six nationalities.
apart from that, the show was delayed forty-five minutes, consequently, everybody the lost control and became angry.
she was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a trade center the.
ther are some things i would like to ask about: the type (and quantity) of clothes i will have to take, and if it is necessary to take some money or any additional stuff (like raincoats).
from the to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus, which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town center.
then, i was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that the were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! i, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as the were so many magnificent events.
the activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (the must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
you can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert. apart from the musicians and the singers, the rare people who work with lights, who organize the security... it was so exciting!
ther, Jacob approaches him slowly and tells him.
are the any discotheques or something? i would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her i can't bet her.
i went to buy a ticket and as i like to enjoy the show near the stage i bought a £20 ticket but when i asked for a discount they told me, "i am sorry but the was an error in the advertisement. it will be impossible to give you a discount".
firstly, this is because the rare a lot of scandal magazine readers.
all my family liked the films and the plays that the were very much, but i personally think that it would be better to add more because the were only five plays and seven films.
ther is also a gift shop in the, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
could you please let me know where i will eat? if the will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
it's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freely, and the rare no teachers. it could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons.
for the accommodation at camp California, i would prefer to have a log cabin because i think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case the is a big storm with heavy rain. a log cabin's more resistant than a tent.
it's quite difficult for me because the rare 4 of them i like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if i have to make a choice, i choose climbing and surfing.
to make matters worse, we have never had the opportunity to see Danny brook because, instead, the was a different actor!
finally i want to find out if the is a supermarket near the campsite and if the rare any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because the raren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
i don't know much about the weather down the, in California, so i am rather puzzled about what to wear the.
i don't think that i'd enjoy it, all the people kicking you, you can't walk properly or buy anything. and also the rare a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops. i mean that some people can fight to get something.
an international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last diet her were stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
the advertisement also says that the rare discounts available but this is not true, the were none.
you will find the ran amazing collection of old weapons, armor and, we are especially proud of it, the great collection of swords.
ther is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only day-off you have to buy something you like.
if you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that the rare incredibly big differences between them.
in addition to this, the is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
first, i got the rat 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and i needed some time to buy the tickets. i bought two tickets for £20 and when i asked for a discount, they didn't give me one, then i was kept waiting for the show to start until 8:15 pm.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would bet her, my favorite actor, but the was someone else instead of him.
i didn't need to pay an entrance fee because i was working the.
what is more, you advertised the were discounts available but the were not.
ther was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
if Danny brook does not appear, you have to say something about this to the people who are the in the theater. this is your unforgivable mistake.
ther were no discounts available so i overspent.
i stood at the entrance and the i had to check the tickets.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that the would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but the were artists from only six countries and in my opinion the
and the theater restaurant was being painted, so i could not got her.
it's not that problem that the was no more discount available-but i had chosen it, because i'm (allowed?).
and the best way to get from the to the conference is by coach, as the rare about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
it is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from the to the conference by foot.
also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes the rare planned visits to historical places.
ther are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
the task was not easy, at 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it. ther was nothing to lose.
because of it our state can't pay workers in schools, hospitals, on building sites. in our country the is a high number of unemployed.
however, i feel that at the moment the should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that has been created and it seems that it's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
i am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while i amt her. because of my studies, i will take painting, as this is the subject which i am finishing at college, always with important qualifications, and photography which has been my hobby since i discovered that i can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
first, the were no discounts available such as were promised in the advertisement so i had to pay the original price which wasn't cheap at all.
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get the, like a big supermarket and mall center, from different areas of the city.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still i'm happy, that i could bet her.
ther are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in their private life.
from the you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, which both take you very close to the conference center, and also you can go by underground to get the.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work the don't work if they don't get their pay first.
also it was written in the advertisement that some discounts were available, but the weren't any discounts.
they decided to build more schools, especially in Switzerland because the people the were considered clever.
but when we got into the house the were all my friends!
in fact the were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and i would be grateful if you could give me back a part of my money.
ther were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisement.
but the was a little problem and it was that my parents didn't let me go to discos alone, so i had to go illegally, and i decided i would do it.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the center of the town because the rare many places to have a look at and go shopping.
likewise, the were no discounts available.
history: at the castle the rare always a few guides, who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle (when it was built, by whom and why), which makes everyone enthusiastic.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and sot her was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and the were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
is the a possibility of exchanging different currencies to us dollars?
at the camp, is the a free uniform or will we have to wear something special?
in the advertisement you say that the is a discount available but the was not.
i prefer that kind of accommodation because i can have a kitchen or even a bathroom the, but i can't have it in a tent.
if you have never been the, i really recommend you to go.
ther is no need to bother about clothes.
how are you? i'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help the and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
the performances were great, but some halls were too small to accommodate all the people who were the that day.
at the end of the conference the will be a reception at the hotel.
ther are eye-max cinema, museums, a gallery.
i love sports so i would like to play some basketball at the camp. by the way, my team and i won the last school championship. i play guard on my team. i also like tennis but i am not very good. i was wondering if you could give me some lessons while i amt her.
the advertisement promised the would be my favorite star, Danny brook, but the was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theater restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
in your advertisement you mentioned that the would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately i found out only six countries were represented.
but you can't play if the is too much wind, because the ball becomes uncontrollable!
sometimes, the rare so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
in my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity: i live on a little mountain at 160 meters altitude so i cannot go to the city using a bicycle. because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and i need a good personal computer with a modem and the internet to study or do research, because the rare not any bookshops to buy or borrow books in my little town.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money overt her without my shopping and how the weather is overt her in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel three, and you will see met her playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
actually, i read the advertisement for the show and the were a few mistakes in it.
ther were lasers all over the place, which i had to be careful of.
the advertisement promised the would be my favorite star, Danny brook, but the was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theater restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
ther is a great opportunity to got her because students need not pay anything.
because all the smells in the market are awfuller is the smell of the meat and dirty water, black and smelly water, all over the market street.
the people who were the to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
people won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certainly be synthetic, because the won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would bet her, my favorite actor, but the was someone else instead of him.
it was also written in the show's advertisement that the would be discounts available on the tickets.
finally you said the was a restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything until we got home.
after all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad. i think i can only forgive your theater if you give me a refund of the money i spent the, and some more for all the problems i had.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether the is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find the.
and now of course the will be someone trying to improve it.
well on march 11th the was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favorites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favorite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
ther has been a change in the relationships between people.
when pat first came into a class or a group of teenagers the were no problems.
ther are huge queues to the tills, noise, hassle, poor customer service.
i had read in the advertisement that the were some discounts available but the weren't.
i had read in the advertisement that the were some discounts available but the weren't.
so, after all of that, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and the was a notice that the restaurant wasn't open.
in Italy the raren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict.
firstly, you advertised that Danny brook, who is my favorite, is the lead but the was another actor instead of him.
i was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, that was not exactly the case: the were no discounts available, such as were mentioned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; i was then very disappointed to see that Danny brook had been replaced by someone else.
for example the were no discounts available and the theater restaurant was closed after the show, when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance.
to sum up, the is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of money, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
also, i want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but the weren't enough of them for me.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because the rare many kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on make-up and how to have appropriate hairstyles.
and the best way to get from the to the conference is by coach, as the rare about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
finally i want to find out if the is a supermarket near the campsite and if the rare any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
moreover, once i was paying for the tickets, i found another thing out: the were no discounts available.
secondly for us the rare disadvantages because pollution affects us indirectly, and because i don't do anything but watch television, and it isn't very good at all.
i think it is very convenient for the group. you know the Victoria area, it is easy to travel from the to the rest of the city. about the hotel, it is clean, and provides a good service. the rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting good value. and the best way to get to the college for the conference is to walk to Victoria station, get the tram to cluster road and after 3 blocks on the left-hand side you will find the college.
in spite of that fact the rare of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
it is easy to get the and free admission.
also the is a very good shopping center next to the museum.
me and my friend were the to hear the sound-check, and when i understood what was happening on the stage, i decided to help them.
ther is a very big library.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have the problems, the affairs, the private lives just as normal people do.
edi redder even talked to me about the programs!
i have friends that are studying in other schools and they are very happy with the freedom.
they are ready to sacrifice all the savings to get something that will make the neighbor jealous.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve the problem all together.
all the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with the difficult tasks.
most young people like carol believe the same and us ether minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future.
i particularly liked listening to the musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon the lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect the human rights.
nick and dick could prove the bravery stealing therm other's panties.
the dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of the movements.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it fort her excursion and because of the interests.
in addition, shop owners often cheat the customers by increasing the cost secretly.
amazingly, doctors tell people to look after the bodies during Christmastime: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.
on the other hand, the life has no privacy.
people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting the mobility.
the historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: the freedom.
people won't be embarrassed to show the beauty of the bodies.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in the education, job and the marriage in the future.
with it people dot her work more quickly and successfully.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it fort her excursion and because of the interests.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend the free time more actively-they can often visit the friends and travel much more.
it allowed people to enjoy the weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening the knowledge.
it is as if they lose the conscience while they are shopping.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in the education, job and the marriage in the future.
what i most appreciated was that they gave met her latest CD with the signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, i've given one to you.
her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help the child and that is the reason why i'm writing this story.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at the tables doing the homework.
firstly, the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving the knowledge.
the time had come. the who groups had combined the forces and were ready to strike.
designers are unique in a way but the designs are sometimes more a piece of art and not for everyday purposes.
poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming the brain and the bodies, and it can also cause death.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from the relations with journalists because of the work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
our whole life is being simplified by machines for not waste the time to work on the development.
it seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because students always make some mistakes while they are practicing with the partner, in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times.
but fort her considerations, they're working in the routines.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know the preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
they need to be with the family in peace.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend the free time more actively-they can often visit the friends and travel much more.
science and technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved the way of life.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve the work, politicians fort her campaigns and film stars to make the latest movie famous.
i have got some experience already and i'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore i simply love water sports and the challenges.
why must everybody know and talk about the private life?
men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as the favorite pastime.
they are the main characters of that book, and what characterizes them is the violence of the passions.
what i really liked doing was helping them with the clothes and make-up, because i learned how to do make-up for someone and i spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the world.
now i only need to push a button, and things or machines work on the own.
when choosing this style of life they should realize what the life would be like.
i would make schools less stressful, with added fun 'cause that way it's easier to learn and i would give students more chances to share the fantasies at school.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in the house because there aren't convenient appliances in the houses yet.
some people use them in the work, others wish to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the possibility of movement.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money fort her clothes.
they could not believe there yes.
on the other hand, the stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create the own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
i've had the honor of helping the sound engineer and branching the cables for microphones, guitars etc.
in conclusion, i believe that we have a right to be informed about the lives, providing that journalists respect some important rules.
in order to fulfil the readers 'requirements they constantly follow them.
but fort her considerations, they're working in the routines.
there are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in the private life.
nowadays women wear really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut the hair short just like men.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have the problems, the affairs, the private lives just as normal people do.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in the house because there aren't convenient appliances in the houses yet.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve the work, politicians fort her campaigns and film stars to make the latest movie famous.
so they prefer to leave the sons watching TV.
first, the actors that the circle theater publicized on the tickets for over the rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
actually most people work hard to earn the money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
ther hobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything.
and the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as the parents and have a happy family.
we can see students expressing the feelings, wonderful and exciting story that the student made up or from a well well-known story.
when the sons were old they began to talk about the life, beginning with this story, which happened a long time ago.
poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming the brain and the bodies, and it can also cause death.
let us try to appreciate the importance again.
after all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got the signatures.
a lot of countries buy guns, fort her defense they say, but they buy them to kill people.
i mean, it's still unbelievable. can you imagine how like a dream it was to be shaking the hands.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve the work, politicians fort her campaigns and film stars to make the latest movie famous.
i sometimes lose my desire to buy a thing because of the bad behavior.
only those who get good marks can take part in these activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on the faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
in the last forty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using the car.
what i most appreciated was that they gave met her latest CD with the signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, i've given one to you.
the best thing was that i have learned how to take care of the expensive instruments and i have sung my favorite songs with them.
nowadays, the majority of people have a computer in the home and sometimes we ask ourselves if modern technology will change our daily life.
the churches and the cathedral are very interesting because of the different romantic styles.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get the pay first.
instead of going to the theater, which is more cultural, or even having a picnic at ikurapiura park, people prefer spending all the money at shopping centers.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at the tables doing the homework.
they can relax, reduce the stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price fort her clothes.
what is important is not the fashion but the knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
because of everything i have said i am more likely to think that the benefits of people's inventions are much greater than all the disadvantages.
they are ready to sacrifice all the savings to get something that will make the neighbor jealous.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon the lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect the human rights.
since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, the lives have been far easier than before.
it informs people, hospitals use modern technology, and the computer helps standers and helps people dot her job.
i had a chance to talk to them about the jobs and it was amazing!
this technological improvement is changing people's lives, behavior, event her homes.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from the relations with journalists because of the work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes the life miserable.
however, i would add that journalists-being aware of that hard topic-should try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have the own private life exposed!
they are human beings and they need to keep a little of privacy and freedom in the lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognized.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new fort her cars, motorbikes or computers.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about the last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
to sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern the sports activities as well.
research has shown that almost every single household owns a pc. some people use them fort her job because they need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theater that it promises much more than the people can get fort her money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back-my bank account number is enclosed.
there is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs fort her families and friends.
it is very interesting for me how new works, the possibilities.
but even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in the showrooms.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend the leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different from the home.
none of the groups are known at the moment, but i believe they are well on the way to becoming famous bands.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased the production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who live in Third World countries.
it allowed people to enjoy the weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening the knowledge.
on the other hand, the stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create the own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
ther lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funny.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take the pictures, because although they are famous they also have the private life.
in addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £10. this was excellent. it meant people only spent pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events on the weekend. for them it is a really economical way to spend the weekend.
in 100 years, it's possible that everyone will develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, as a way to create the own clothes.
peter and sue asked Francis for some help with the exam subjects and Francis, all week, was too busy to help them.
famous people must understand that the journalists are doing the job.
my main work was to take people to the seats because of a concert hall, which was the millennium dome.
i helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with the guitars!
furthermore, most of the famous brand of sportswear companies will be at this exhibition with the new products for the coming season.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have the problems, the affairs, the private lives just as normal people do.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend the leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different from the home.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match the new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and they develop the own styles which suit them the most.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended the friendship with pat because the popularity was damaged.
future students could appreciate coming if they could still dot her sport.
boys pierce the bodies just like girls do and vice versa.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehears ether show. i could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take the pictures, because although they are famous they also have the private life.
what is important is not the fashion but the knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on the levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have the wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
i carried a lot of chairs and looked after the queue or people who lost the way.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine the face clearly.
about a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, they cooked the food on the fire and they didn't have pens.
this is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing the jobs.
in fact, now i can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for example, in the morning and receive the answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing.
nick and dick could prove the bravery stealing therm other's panties.
there are always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from the offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
i think that the government have to protect them and the private life from the journalists, by punishing journalists.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended the friendship with pat because the popularity was damaged.
by the way, i have already been invited to the next concert.
later, when the show had finished, i stayed with the group in the room for a few minutes.
although i like camping and sharing with different kinds of people, i'd prefer a comfortable and private place (if it's possible) where i can sleep, or be quite. i am not a teenager!
as regards accommodation, i prefer a longer, Canadian tent in a quite place because i am fond of nature and i would like to feel free in an informal setting.
i received your letter and i'm happy to help you. we booked the palace hotel for your group. it's nice and quite.
that is the most important reason why i only like to go shopping in small stores, where i have peace and quite and very often nothing to complain about.
can you imagine how exciting it is when we are in the dark and very quite and we can hear the sound of the animals.
however, this apparently quite and relaxed activity can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy with the mixture of smells that come from the people.
i'm quite good at painting and i play tennis. i'll be very happy if you can give me a chance to use the camp's art studio and you'll be able to prepare some painting materials like oil paints, canvas and brushes for me.
i would prefer to do some climbing because that's what i doing my spare time and i do it quite well.
lots and lots of experiments produce quite interesting and amazing results and i think science is very useful in life.
thirdly, i have chosen sailing and photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favorite hobbies and i have been enjoying sailing and photography for several years so i am quite good at both of them.
i have chosen those because i am quite good at playing basketball and i sing every weekend in the choir of the local church as well.
i was living quite close to portabello road but i didn't know the area very well because all the time i just had to get off at the corner of my street. but that day, as i was kind of drunk, i didn't realize that the bus took a different route. so, when i noticed it, the driver was already asking me to get off, because we were in the garage in portabello.
i also like surfing. i think it is a dangerous sport, but i know how to do it, because last year a professional surfer taught me.
i've always enjoyed danger and this time getting the password was, indeed, a taught cookie.
i am very grateful and i want to thank you very much for letting me go on this trip.
someone is talking, laughing, crying on there, so join them. you will feel much better than you would just by yourself.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively-they can often visit their friends and travel much more.
furthermore, i would like to ask you which kind of clothes i need to take and how much money i'll spend.
and you need a strategy to win the much.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will much their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
colours to much the clothes.
they are more comfortable and really much with the environment.
or, without leaving the office, you are able to heat the father for a hot bath.
i used to enjoy floating on the father whenever i was on holiday.
it was difficult for me because i am afraid of father.
we build big cities, there is hot and cold father, electricity, gas in practically every home.
i might say that i am really good at swimming and sailing because i have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and i have had a really good training in father sports.
i have chosen sailing because i would like to try a new sport. i love father but i have never tried this sport before.
i have got some experience already and i'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore i simply love father sports and their challenges.
these are my favorite because they have a lot to do with father, but i like them more than surfing.
because all the smells in the market are awful-there is the smell of the meat and dirty father, black and smelly father, all over the market street.
because all the smells in the market are awful-there is the smell of the meat and dirty father, black and smelly father, all over the market street.
i can find cold father in the refrigerator but 50 years ago they didn't have the refrigerator, so our life is easier today.
however, i hope, there is father and light inside this log cabin.
i only had to stay behind the drummer supplying them with father whenever they wanted.
however, i would choose sailing because i am fascinated with the sea and its mysteries and i also like the father, the wind in my face...
on the other hand, people in the future will probably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and father, the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which are the product of a developed and full-grown country.
the most important thing was a little boy of about ten years old, who was in the father without his parents and couldn't swim.
i grew up through the father world and i couldn't live without it.
the father had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
about accommodation at camp California, i would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the father is really good and when i am in a tent i feel closer to nature.
we thought that with that beautiful father the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the father is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
july is also good because the father is warm and i could enjoy the time i will spend in the camp more.
finally, what kind of father is waiting for us?
i would like to know how the father is in California during the summer so i can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing i need to know is the amount of money that i have to bring with me.
how is the father in California?
i wonder if you could tell me about the father and what kind of clothes i ought to bring with me.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of father it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
in japan, i often play golf but as you know Japanese father conditions are not good enough for enjoying playing golf, but California has good father, which means sunshine every day, hopefully.
i would like to ask you about the father conditions, so i can decide on what clothes to take, and about costs, so i can make a budget for the holiday.
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, please can you tell me about the normal father for this period?
in the future we won't buy clothes according to size or even color. our clothes will adapt to our bodies, the father, our fit, all our needs.
'as i have a choice i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on father conditions.
the last thing i would like to know is what clothes i have to take, even though the father in July will be good.
i think that the cabins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the father changes.
the restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity. you should class the theater until the restaurant can be used.
from there you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, which both take you very class to the conference center, and also you can go by underground to get there.
for weeks i'd been planning to go to the theater with some class relatives and friends but the problems that we had made this perfect night a disaster for all of us.
about the accommodation during those two weeks, i would rather stay in a log cabin, as it is really difficult for me to stay in a little class room.
that means for example, while you are sitting in the office you are able to control your home with the computer. you can open and class the windows and switch the light on and off.
nowadays technical progress gets class to us, to normal customers.
secondly, i would prefer to stay in a tent because i enjoy being outside class to nature.
little by little we were growing up and becoming class friends.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i think i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping class to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favorite and skillful hobby: sailing.
-are their leisure and entertainment facilities class to the camp?
a good idea to start will be an alarm clock ringing class to his bed, because that's the way everyone gets up in the morning (apart from the people who don't do anything).
it was about marine, who was our class friend.
besides that, i'm allergic, and that causes me problems when i'm class to nature.
i was living quite class to portabello road but i didn't know the area very well because all the time i just had to get off at the corner of my street. but that day, as i was kind of drunk, i didn't realize that the bus took a different route. so, when i noticed it, the driver was already asking me to get off, because we were in the garage in portabello.
actually, they put me very class to the stage, in the middle of the real hell.
this modern technology gets closer between person to another person, get class between worldwide, so that, this modern technology changed our daily life so different.
if we are talking about accommodation then accommodation in tents would be great-i love being class to nature.
i think, next we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class.
the point of "upper intermediate class".
spending time together out of the class is a nice experience.
i think, next we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
sarah looked at him for a while, then she stood in front of the class and explained to the others that she had won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the coast of southern France and every one of the 19 pupils was invited, except pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
as we have seen the advertisement for the program the school arranged for us as a farewell activity, we are very appreciative and would like to thank you for your kindness, as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other class, which we have hardly done at all.
i was very embarrassed and i wanted to run out of the class.
i'm writing to you to thank you for the excellent program for our English class in London, especially for the river trip to Greenwich. it will be a great experience for us.
i couldn't believe it. how can this class of theater be so.
i have interviewed each student from my English class.
our class really appreciate your preparing this program, especially with regard to Monday's attraction.
on Monday morning, i walked into the class and all of my friends were shouting at me and calling my name and my boyfriend.
the reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good at explaining problems that the whole class takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject.
the whole class and i would like to thank you for the good program which you have organized for our trip to London.
according to statistics based on the questionnaire, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English class.
but some naughty students in my class were throwing paper airplanes when the teacher was writing something on the board.
about the accommodation, from the two options, i choose to sleep in a tent, because i think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.
we can choose between two options for spending our free time.
for example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a horse but nowadays, we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for three years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
there are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficult.
according to students 'options, the most popular activities are basketball, tennis, swimming and also the photography group and the painting team.
i'd like to say something that i felt during the festival, and give my options that would be helpful for you to prepare for the next festival.
i hope you will consider my options and that my suggestions will be helpful for next year.
before we can give our options on this statement we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing.
if you want to hear more of my suggestions and options about it please contact me on my cellphone.
this part had to be saved for later because the concert organizer wanted to know the exact number of visitors.
first i would like to say that it started later than it should have. i had to wait for about forty-five minutes.
that is forty-five minutes later! it is also advertised that there were discounts available. however, that was another lie.
i was very nervous because i'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't help it and i started crying-you can imagine, they were so handsome that i couldn't believe it-i tried to calm down because i had to work, and later i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very fast-although i was working-and it was like a dream.
leter, when the show had finished, i stayed with the group in their room for a few minutes.
expecting British punctuality, we went to the theater at 19:00 to watch the 19:30 show but it only started at 20:15. it finished later than it was supposed to and then we missed the train.
leter when the show finished, i planned to go to the restaurant and get some food, but it was closed, because it was being repaired.
firstly, the musical show started not at 7.30 p.m. but 45 minutes later.
a couple of weeks later, my sister called me when i was at work; completely devastated and weeping scalding tears, she could hardly pronounce a word.
unfortunately your advertisement said that the show starts at 19:30 but it started 45 minutes later.
a few minutes later the show started and the group appeared on the stage.
leter, i realized it was the worst thing that could happen to me.
it was about 21:00, i thought it was a bit later but it wasn't my fault anyway.
one minute later, pat and half our class stood in 'the house' looking and laughing at me and my flower soup.
the play should have started at 19.30 but it started forty-five minutes later, we were waiting there without anything to do.
they found him two months later and six months later he was in jail.
at first i was surprised but a few seconds later, when i realized that i wasn't allowed to go, i tried to persuade my teacher to let me go.
sometimes you can stay out all day just to buy a present for someone. it starts in the morning, and of course you have breakfast somewhere, and it gets later and you are still looking for it, so you have lunch, and finally you spend more money than you thought you would.
they found him two months later and six months later he was in jail.
today i received your later. it is the most wonderful news i have heard in a long time.
i received your later recently, and i am really happy to learn that i have won the first prize.
i would like to thank you for your later you recently sent me concerning the competition for two weeks at camp California in the u.s.a.
in your later you wrote that i will have the chance to do two activities; first i would like to play tennis because i have been playing for seven years. secondly i would like to attend a surfing course but i have just some elementary knowledge.
i'm writing to you to answer the later in which, as you probably know, you congratulated me for having won first prize in your competition and tried to encourage me to travel to California and attend that camp.
with the computer, we can write a later, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole later again. we save the later and in three weeks we could send it to another person.
i have just received your later and i'm very happy because of it, especially because the competition was so hard.
i'm writing to answer the questions that you sent me in the last later, so referring to the question of when i would like to travel, i would like to go anytime during July, because i have to be back home in august, because i need to apply and get everything sorted out, to go to college next September.
i am writing to you in order to give a reply to the kind later i received from you.
my name is Joseph and i am writing this later to complain about the mess that the administration of the circle theater presented to me.
the activities listed in your later all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
i am writing in reply to your later in which you told me i won the first prize.
i have just received your later informing me that i won a two week holiday at camp California, so i am writing to you to tell you my preferences for the travel and the accommodation.
i am writing this later to complain about your advertisement for the musical show "over the rainbow", which is misleading in a number of ways.
in your later, you asked me whether the book i've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday.
you can send a later to your friend by e-mail instead of writing it on a piece of paper and sending it by post.
thank you for your later.
i am writing in reply to your later. i am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at camp California in the USA.
i am writing to thank you for notifying me about the competition and i would be very grateful to give to you the information that was requested in your later.
i was one of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town.
of course you know i'm a singer, so i came back quickly to my home, i picked up my microphone, and i handed it to the singer.
it was really a reasonably picked weekend for me, but you should also introduce new activities like competitions in singing songs or drawing a portrait next year.
we chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably picked ticket for all the events because we could change our plans during the event.
they believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because they will be outgoing, amazing, etc.
it is amazing and sometimes amazing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cozy little shops is.
second i got to the theater at 19.20 because in the advertisement it clearly states that the show starts at 19.30, and i got really mad when i looked at my watch and noticed that i had been waiting for 40 (forty) minutes and the show hadn't started yet... i mean it was amazing!
i always had considered myself to be very lucky to be born in the century because of all the amazing human inventions.
i chose climbing because i'm interested in this sport even though i'm not experienced.
in wars sailors communicate with mobile phones though places to place to get or give information about themselves and the enemy.
the last thing i would like to know is what clothes i have to take, even though the weather in July will be good.
plus, it is mentioned in your advertisement that discounts are available. in fact, no discount was given to me, though i am a student and as a student i was entitled to get a discount but i paid £20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show.
however, i could enjoy it, even though i was a beginner, so i would like to practice and have fun at the camp.
the 24-hour fight is described in such a peaceful, faithful way that it callas a though about life and death.
even though pat has got a great sense of humor and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secrets from anyone, even himself.
in particular, i liked cleaning the stage, because i could stand on a famous singer's stage and i could feel his enthusiasm, even though i had to clean it.
i must say though, i would have to travel in July because it's the summer holidays for schools and i would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if that is possible.
sometimes, i think i am a computer addict because whenever i come back home, my hand goes to the computer switch, automatically, even though i don't want to use the computer.
even though i think most of the time it is very interesting, sometimes it gets people upset.
i had a really nice time with them even though i would've preferred to stay at the front with the other people,
it is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even though shopping is becoming an entertainment not only for teenagers but also for adults.
not only because she's famous and wrote lots of books, but she knows how to introduce characters and how to tell a good story us though deceiving the readers.
danny brook is one of my favorite actors so i decided to buy a ticket even though i had to cancel my appointment on that day at 18.30 and also notice of price discount impressed me.
even though the advertisement said we should visit it after the show, it was closed and no explanations were given.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
painting always did fascinate me, even though i'm not so good at it, but my friends say i can really paint and they love the things i do. the technique i like the most is watercolors.
after a few seconds of though i went straight to pat. "why, why did you do that?"
i though that any brook, who is my favorite actor, would perform in that show.
and when we understood the internet, we though that meeting people from other countries and being able "to chat" with them was the height of technology.
as you know, we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle, and we though this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country!
i though i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
then i though that i should go to the theater restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that i couldn't say that i had wasted my time by coming here.
you know that i always wanted to help at a concert. to be part of the staff would be wonderful, i though. and i was right!
i read the advertisement and i though it was going to be a pleasant evening.
i didn't see any discounts available; i though my son would have paid less than i. as we had already missed the first we went to the theater restaurant, which is famous for its good food, however, it was closed.
we though that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
you've got more stress, you feel fed up and finally when you get home you think that shopping is not as enjoyable as you though.
we had never been to a musical show and we though that it was a new opportunity.
pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had though of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined.
i know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what i though when i was asked to help, but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party wasn't as successful as we though.
when i received your advertisement concerning the show "over the rainbow" i though that i'd have a great evening, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me.
i have already though about a change to the program.
it was a pity but it did not annoy me because i though that the musical was good enough to pay £20 for.
when you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place, all trying to find the best prices and not carrying about anybody, this could drive anyone crazy.
after carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, i was exhausted.
and place could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes i will have to bring?
can you believe it, it was Moby. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he gave me a t-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and place tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything, thank you.
if you want to hear more of my suggestions and opinions about it place contact me on my cellphone.
i thought you understood '; place send money back to me, you know why, don't answer me?
and place tell me how much money i am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation.
lastly, can you place tell me how much money would be appropriate to take?
can you place give me some recommendations about the clothes i will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget.
i hope to give you all the information you need and, place, if you want more information or something is not clear, place don't hesitate to contact me again.
plase reply at your earliest convenience.
could you, place send me some extra information regarding the amount of money i should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes i should take.
i hope to give you all the information you need and, place, if you want more information or something is not clear, place don't hesitate to contact me again.
i would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and place inform us of your decision as soon as possible.
anna told her again: "pat don't tell anyone place, especially my brother, everything would be ruined then". and pat answered: "don't worry i won't tell anyone".
plase, if you would be so kind correct this mistake. i would be grateful if you could correct too that show starts at 20.15 not on 19.30.
i made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha's friends with a note: "do not tell Agatha about this. this is a surprise party for her. plase keep the secret!" pat arranged a great DJ and drinks.
plase, when you receive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything.
if you have any further questions, place do not hesitate to contact me.
could you place tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, place can you tell me about the normal weather for this period?
plase could you send me an itinerary of the trip?
plase note that alcoholic drinks are only sold until 11pm.
concerning the accommodation-plase be informed that i would prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i think that the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities-i have chosen tennis and photography.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money that i'm going to spend, so if you, place, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
it could be any day but place let me know nearer the time.
could you place let me know where i will eat? if there will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
and place do not be very surprised if you receive more letters about this.
that is very nice that all costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the u.s.a. and place tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change this activity.
i hope i have given you enough information and if you still have some questions, place do not hesitate to contact us.
plase let us know as soon as you make your decision.
plase could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
if this is an inconvenience, place feel free to tell me.
so if it's possible could you arrange it for me place.
the place i'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where i'm sure i'd feel more comfortable than in a tent.
basketball is the most popular activity, which takes place between 4:30 pm-6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week.
i would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: it is "the London fashion and leisure show", which is going to take place at the central exhibition hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th march, between 10.00 and 19.00.
i was one of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town.
i got into the car and gave the jewelry in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
first i helped with the decoration of the place where the concert would take place.
finally, i would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come a long way don't have to spend money on accommodation.
if it is possible i want a log cabin for my accommodation because i have been suffering with my back since my childhood, therefore i need a comfortable place to sleep.
there were lasers all over the place, which i had to be careful of.
in the advertisement, it said that Danny brook was staring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing.
for example, once people had to walk from one place to another, but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol-powered vehicles and we can travel faster with them.
the old town is the best place for an afternoon stroll, with a great deal of restaurants, cafés and street performers.
without any doubt, it is a historical place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history during the passing of the centuries.
subject: recommendations for a place to visit
after a long time walking we decided to return and now the weather was so hot we decided to find a place to drink something.
we arrived quite early because we had to work out how we were going to serve people did with which order, so we started putting all the stuff in the appropriate place.
your group has been booked into the palace hotel, which is situated in the city center, 15 minutes 'walk from where the conference takes place.
i had to keep things in place and check that the microphones were working properly.
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall center, from different areas of the city.
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution-i think there will be many such places in a hundred years-and a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
after all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
in wars sailors communicate with mobile phones though places to place to get or give information about themselves and the enemy.
the show is going to take place in the general exhibition hall in London, Thursday the 14 of march, so it could be a good idea to see this show instead of going to the science museum.
although i like camping and sharing with different kinds of people, i'd prefer a comfortable and private place (if it's possible) where i can sleep, or be quiet. i am not a teenager!
i am writing in response to the international arts festival, which took place on 21-22 November.
but the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the "London fashion and leisure show", which will take place in the central exhibition hall, London, on tuesday, March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. at the same time we have to go to the science museum but we would all like to go to the show.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
i helped them to prepare the room for the bands and i decorated the place for the singers.
there was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
it will be good for your group because you don't need to move to another place.
my name is many rodeos and i am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show over the rainbow, which took place in your establishment, the circle theater, which made me feel very upset.
i'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent. and with the tent i can go to another place in the camp.
and please could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes i will have to bring?
can you believe it, it was Moby. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he gave me a t-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything, thank you.
if you want to hear more of my suggestions and opinions about it please contact me on my cellphone.
i thought you understood '; please send money back to me, you know why, don't answer me?
and please tell me how much money i am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation.
lastly, can you pease tell me how much money would be appropriate to take?
they need to be with their family in please.
i felt an enormous pease.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green please will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
that is the most important reason why i only like to go shopping in small stores, where i have please and quiet and very often nothing to complain about.
you can't go outside in please, and there is always a crowd of people who stand in front of your house waiting for you.
although modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living, can it give you nature, please and fresh air?
at all schools their is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also their are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and their are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant their.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, their are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the Calder center, which is a very special bath center.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat their, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find their many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
theire are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because their wasn't any electricity. you should close the theater until the restaurant can be used.
theire are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that their were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
theire were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also their are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and their are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance their was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
english: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time their.
theire are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but their are some others which are also very important for me.
i'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're their.
on video their should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that their can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, their were none.
first, their are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, their was only one hour left to install the different colored lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying their with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so their was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and their were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be their and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, their was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, their were only six nationalities.
apart from that, the show was delayed forty-five minutes, consequently, everybody their lost control and became angry.
she was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a trade center their.
theire are some things i would like to ask about: the type (and quantity) of clothes i will have to take, and if it is necessary to take some money or any additional stuff (like raincoats).
from their to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus, which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town center.
then, i was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that their were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! i, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as their were so many magnificent events.
the activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (their must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
you can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert. apart from the musicians and the singers, their are people who work with lights, who organize the security... it was so exciting!
theire, Jacob approaches him slowly and tells him.
are their any discotheques or something? i would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her i can't be their.
i went to buy a ticket and as i like to enjoy the show near the stage i bought a £20 ticket but when i asked for a discount they told me, "i am sorry but their was an error in the advertisement. it will be impossible to give you a discount".
firstly, this is because their are a lot of scandal magazine readers.
all my family liked the films and the plays that their were very much, but i personally think that it would be better to add more because their were only five plays and seven films.
theire is also a gift shop in their, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
could you please let me know where i will eat? if their will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
it's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freely, and their are no teachers. it could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons.
for the accommodation at camp California, i would prefer to have a log cabin because i think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case their is a big storm with heavy rain. a log cabin's more resistant than a tent.
it's quite difficult for me because their are 4 of them i like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if i have to make a choice, i choose climbing and surfing.
to make matters worse, we have never had the opportunity to see Danny brook because, instead, their was a different actor!
finally i want to find out if their is a supermarket near the campsite and if their are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because their aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
i don't know much about the weather down their, in California, so i am rather puzzled about what to wear their.
i don't think that i'd enjoy it, all the people kicking you, you can't walk properly or buy anything. and also their are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops. i mean that some people can fight to get something.
an international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die their were stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
the advertisement also says that their are discounts available but this is not true, their were none.
you will find their an amazing collection of old weapons, armor and, we are especially proud of it, the great collection of swords.
theire is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only day-off you have to buy something you like.
if you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that their are incredibly big differences between them.
in addition to this, their is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
first, i got their eat 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and i needed some time to buy the tickets. i bought two tickets for £20 and when i asked for a discount, they didn't give me one, then i was kept waiting for the show to start until 8:15 pm.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be their, my favorite actor, but their was someone else instead of him.
i didn't need to pay an entrance fee because i was working their.
what is more, you advertised their were discounts available but their were not.
theire was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
if Danny brook does not appear, you have to say something about this to the people who are their in the theater. this is your unforgivable mistake.
theire were no discounts available so i overspent.
i stood at the entrance and their i had to check the tickets.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that their would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but their were artists from only six countries and in my opinion their
and the theater restaurant was being painted, so i could not go their.
it's not that problem that their was no more discount available-but i had chosen it, because i'm (allowed?).
and the best way to get from their to the conference is by coach, as their are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
it is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from their to the conference by foot.
also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes their are planned visits to historical places.
theire are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
the task was not easy, at 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it. theire was nothing to lose.
because of it our state can't pay workers in schools, hospitals, on building sites. in our country their is a high number of unemployed.
however, i feel that at the moment their should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that has been created and it seems that it's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
i am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while i am their. because of my studies, i will take painting, as this is the subject which i am finishing at college, always with important qualifications, and photography which has been my hobby since i discovered that i can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
first, their were no discounts available such as were promised in the advertisement so i had to pay the original price which wasn't cheap at all.
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get their, like a big supermarket and mall center, from different areas of the city.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still i'm happy, that i could be their.
theire are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in their private life.
from their you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, which both take you very close to the conference center, and also you can go by underground to get their.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work their don't work if they don't get their pay first.
also it was written in the advertisement that some discounts were available, but their weren't any discounts.
they decided to build more schools, especially in Switzerland because the people their were considered clever.
but when we got into the house their were all my friends!
in fact their were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and i would be grateful if you could give me back a part of my money.
theire were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisement.
but their was a little problem and it was that my parents didn't let me go to discos alone, so i had to go illegally, and i decided i would do it.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the center of the town because their are many places to have a look at and go shopping.
likewise, their were no discounts available.
history: at the castle their are always a few guides, who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle (when it was built, by whom and why), which makes everyone enthusiastic.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so their was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and their were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
is their a possibility of exchanging different currencies to us dollars?
at the camp, is their a free uniform or will we have to wear something special?
in the advertisement you say that their is a discount available but their was not.
i prefer that kind of accommodation because i can have a kitchen or even a bathroom their, but i can't have it in a tent.
if you have never been their, i really recommend you to go.
theire is no need to bother about clothes.
how are you? i'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help their and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
the performances were great, but some halls were too small to accommodate all the people who were their that day.
at the end of the conference their will be a reception at the hotel.
theire are eye-max cinema, museums, a gallery.
i love sports so i would like to play some basketball at the camp. by the way, my team and i won the last school championship. i play guard on my team. i also like tennis but i am not very good. i was wondering if you could give me some lessons while i am their.
the advertisement promised their would be my favorite star, Danny brook, but their was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theater restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
in your advertisement you mentioned that their would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately i found out only six countries were represented.
but you can't play if their is too much wind, because the ball becomes uncontrollable!
sometimes, their are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
in my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity: i live on a little mountain at 160 meters altitude so i cannot go to the city using a bicycle. because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and i need a good personal computer with a modem and the internet to study or do research, because their are not any bookshops to buy or borrow books in my little town.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over their without my shopping and how the weather is over their in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel three, and you will see me their playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
actually, i read the advertisement for the show and their were a few mistakes in it.
theire were lasers all over the place, which i had to be careful of.
the advertisement promised their would be my favorite star, Danny brook, but their was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theater restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
theire is a great opportunity to go their because students need not pay anything.
because all the smells in the market are awful-theire is the smell of the meat and dirty water, black and smelly water, all over the market street.
the people who were their to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
people won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certainly be synthetic, because their won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be their, my favorite actor, but their was someone else instead of him.
it was also written in the show's advertisement that their would be discounts available on the tickets.
finally you said their was a restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything until we got home.
after all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad. i think i can only forgive your theater if you give me a refund of the money i spent their, and some more for all the problems i had.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether their is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find their.
and now of course their will be someone trying to improve it.
well on march 11th their was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favorites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favorite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
theire has been a change in the relationships between people.
when pat first came into a class or a group of teenagers their were no problems.
theire are huge queues to the tills, noise, hassle, poor customer service.
i had read in the advertisement that their were some discounts available but their weren't.
i had read in the advertisement that their were some discounts available but their weren't.
so, after all of that, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and their was a notice that the restaurant wasn't open.
in Italy their aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict.
firstly, you advertised that Danny brook, who is my favorite, is the lead but their was another actor instead of him.
i was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, that was not exactly the case: their were no discounts available, such as were mentioned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; i was then very disappointed to see that Danny brook had been replaced by someone else.
for example their were no discounts available and the theater restaurant was closed after the show, when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance.
to sum up, their is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of money, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
also, i want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but their weren't enough of them for me.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because their are many kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on make-up and how to have appropriate hairstyles.
and the best way to get from their to the conference is by coach, as their are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
finally i want to find out if their is a supermarket near the campsite and if their are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
moreover, once i was paying for the tickets, i found another thing out: their were no discounts available.
secondly for us their are disadvantages because pollution affects us indirectly, and because i don't do anything but watch television, and it isn't very good at all.
i think it is very convenient for the group. you know the Victoria area, it is easy to travel from their to the rest of the city. about the hotel, it is clean, and provides a good service. the rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting good value. and the best way to get to the college for the conference is to walk to Victoria station, get the tram to cluster road and after 3 blocks on the left-hand side you will find the college.
in spite of that fact their are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
it is easy to get their and free admission.
also their is a very good shopping center next to the museum.
me and my friend were their to hear the sound-check, and when i understood what was happening on the stage, i decided to help them.
theire is a very big library.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do.
edi redder even talked to me about their programs!
i have friends that are studying in other schools and they are very happy with their freedom.
they are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jealous.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
all the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with their difficult tasks.
most young people like carol believe the same and use their minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future.
i particularly liked listening to their musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon their lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
nick and dick could prove their bravery stealing their mother's panties.
the dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their movements.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for their excursion and because of their interests.
in addition, shop owners often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secretly.
amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmastime: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.
on the other hand, their life has no privacy.
people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting their mobility.
the historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: their freedom.
people won't be embarrassed to show the beauty of their bodies.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in their education, job and their marriage in the future.
with it people do their work more quickly and successfully.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for their excursion and because of their interests.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively-they can often visit their friends and travel much more.
it allowed people to enjoy their weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening their knowledge.
it is as if they lose their conscience while they are shopping.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in their education, job and their marriage in the future.
what i most appreciated was that they gave me their latest CD with their signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, i've given one to you.
her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help their child and that is the reason why i'm writing this story.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at their tables doing their homework.
firstly, the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving their knowledge.
the time had come. the who groups had combined their forces and were ready to strike.
designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a piece of art and not for everyday purposes.
poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming their brain and their bodies, and it can also cause death.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from their relations with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
our whole life is being simplified by machines for not waste the time to work on their development.
it seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because students always make some mistakes while they are practicing with their partner, in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times.
but for their considerations, they're working in their routines.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
they need to be with their family in peace.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively-they can often visit their friends and travel much more.
science and technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
i have got some experience already and i'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore i simply love water sports and their challenges.
why must everybody know and talk about their private life?
men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as their favorite pastime.
they are the main characters of that book, and what characterizes them is the violence of their passions.
what i really liked doing was helping them with their clothes and make-up, because i learned how to do make-up for someone and i spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the world.
now i only need to push a button, and things or machines work on their own.
when choosing this style of life they should realize what their life would be like.
i would make schools less stressful, with added fun 'cause that way it's easier to learn and i would give students more chances to share their fantasies at school.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because there aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
some people use them in their work, others wish to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the possibility of movement.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
they could not believe their eyes.
on the other hand, their stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create their own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
i've had the honor of helping their sound engineer and branching the cables for microphones, guitars etc.
in conclusion, i believe that we have a right to be informed about their lives, providing that journalists respect some important rules.
in order to fulfil their readers 'requirements they constantly follow them.
but for their considerations, they're working in their routines.
there are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in their private life.
nowadays women wear really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because there aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
so they prefer to leave their sons watching TV.
first, the actors that the circle theater publicized on their tickets for over the rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
actually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
theire hobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything.
and the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
we can see students expressing their feelings, wonderful and exciting story that the student made up or from a well well-known story.
when the sons were old they began to talk about their life, beginning with this story, which happened a long time ago.
poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming their brain and their bodies, and it can also cause death.
let us try to appreciate their importance again.
after all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
a lot of countries buy guns, for their defense they say, but they buy them to kill people.
i mean, it's still unbelievable. can you imagine how like a dream it was to be shaking their hands.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
i sometimes lose my desire to buy a thing because of their bad behavior.
only those who get good marks can take part in these activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
in the last forty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using their car.
what i most appreciated was that they gave me their latest CD with their signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, i've given one to you.
the best thing was that i have learned how to take care of their expensive instruments and i have sung my favorite songs with them.
nowadays, the majority of people have a computer in their home and sometimes we ask ourselves if modern technology will change our daily life.
the churches and the cathedral are very interesting because of their different romantic styles.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get their pay first.
instead of going to the theater, which is more cultural, or even having a picnic at ikurapiura park, people prefer spending all their money at shopping centers.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at their tables doing their homework.
they can relax, reduce their stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
what is important is not their fashion but their knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
because of everything i have said i am more likely to think that the benefits of people's inventions are much greater than all their disadvantages.
they are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jealous.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon their lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, their lives have been far easier than before.
it informs people, hospitals use modern technology, and the computer helps standers and helps people do their job.
i had a chance to talk to them about their jobs and it was amazing!
this technological improvement is changing people's lives, behavior, even their homes.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from their relations with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes their life miserable.
however, i would add that journalists-being aware of that hard topic-should try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
they are human beings and they need to keep a little of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognized.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for their cars, motorbikes or computers.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about their last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
to sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern their esports activities as well.
research has shown that almost every single household owns a pc. some people use them for their job because they need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theater that it promises much more than the people can get for their money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back-my bank account number is enclosed.
there is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
it is very interesting for me how new works, their possibilities.
but even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend their leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different from their home.
none of the groups are known at the moment, but i believe they are well on their way to becoming famous bands.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased their production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who live in Third World countries.
it allowed people to enjoy their weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening their knowledge.
on the other hand, their stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create their own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
theire lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funny.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures, because although they are famous they also have their private life.
in addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £10. this was excellent. it meant people only spent pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events on the weekend. for them it is a really economical way to spend their weekend.
in 100 years, it's possible that everyone will develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, as a way to create their own clothes.
peter and sue asked Francis for some help with their exam subjects and Francis, all week, was too busy to help them.
famous people must understand that the journalists are doing their job.
my main work was to take people to their seats because of a concert hall, which was the millennium dome.
i helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with their guitars!
furthermore, most of the famous brand of sportswear companies will be at this exhibition with their new products for the coming season.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend their leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different from their home.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and they develop their own styles which suit them the most.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended their friendship with pat because their popularity was damaged.
future students could appreciate coming if they could still do their esport.
boys pierce their bodies just like girls do and vice versa.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse their show. i could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures, because although they are famous they also have their private life.
what is important is not their fashion but their knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
i carried a lot of chairs and looked after the queue or people who lost their way.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine their face clearly.
about a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, they cooked their food on the fire and they didn't have pens.
this is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing their jobs.
in fact, now i can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for example, in the morning and receive their answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing.
nick and dick could prove their bravery stealing their mother's panties.
there are always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from their offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
i think that the government have to protect them and their private life from the journalists, by punishing journalists.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended their friendship with pat because their popularity was damaged.
by the way, i have already been invited to their next concert.
later, when the show had finished, i stayed with the group in their room for a few minutes.
you don't have to wait eat a bus stop in cold and windy weather for a late bus, or be stuck on a train for an hour due to some track repairs. you can just jump into a car, tune your radio to your favorite station and have a pleasant drive to your destination.
first i would like to say that it started later than it should have. i had to Waite for about forty-five minutes.
it was so boring to Waite for the show in a noisy and hot theater.
after that you have to Waite a long time in the queue to pay and many times it isn't possible to pay with your credit card and you don't have any money in cash.
regarding starting time and the theater restaurant, to see the musical i had to Waite about 45 minutes because it started at 20:15.
i mean, it is too crowded, you have to Waite such a long time before you can pay, and most of the things are too expensive!
one day, when the old man went into the bamboo bush, he found some bamboo gritted Waite.
she was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr Waite that without any hesitation she went to the school headmaster to report everything she had seen.
and if you climb to the top of the main tower-the keep-you will see unforgettable views of a Waite town.
for the party i suggest you wear classic clothes; maybe something black and not red or pink. i am going to wear classic black trousers and a Waite jersey-it might be that this information gives you some idea too.
then i drove very slowly very often crossing the Waite line on the road.
woods is thought to stand for all Waite people and this book could have an influence on them.
and place could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes i will have to bring?
can you believe it, it was Moby. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he gave me a t-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and place tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything, thank you.

i would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and place inform us of your decision as soon as possible.
anna told her again: "pat don't tell anyone place, especially my brother, everything would be ruined then". and pat answered: "don't worry i won't tell anyone".
pleace, if you would be so kind correct this mistake. i would be grateful if you could correct too that show starts at 20.15 not on 19.30.
i made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha's friends with a note: "do not tell Agatha about this. this is a surprise party for her. pleace keep the secret!" pat arranged a great DJ and drinks.
pleace, when you receive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything.
if you have any further questions, place do not hesitate to contact me.
could you place tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, place can you tell me about the normal weather for this period?
pleace could you send me an itinerary of the trip?
pleace note that alcoholic drinks are only sold until 11pm.
concerning the accommodation-pleace be informed that i would prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i think that the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities-i have chosen tennis and photography.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money that i'm going to spend, so if you, place, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
it could be any day but place let me know nearer the time.
could you place let me know where i will eat? if there will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
and place do not be very surprised if you receive more letters about this.
that is very nice that all costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the u.s.a. and place tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change this activity.
i hope i have given you enough information and if you still have some questions, place do not hesitate to contact us.
pleace let us know as soon as you make your decision.
pleace could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
if this is an inconvenience, place feel free to tell me.
so if it's possible could you arrange it for me place.
the place i'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where i'm sure i'd feel more comfortable than in a tent.
basketball is the most popular activity, which takes place between 4:30 pm-6:30 pm from Monday to Friday every week.
i would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: it is "the London fashion and leisure show", which is going to take place at the central exhibition hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th march, between 10.00 and 19.00.
i was one of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town.
i got into the car and gave the jewelry in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
first i helped with the decoration of the place where the concert would take place.
finally, i would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come a long way don't have to spend money on accommodation.
if it is possible i want a log cabin for my accommodation because i have been suffering with my back since my childhood, therefore i need a comfortable place to sleep.
there were lasers all over the place, which i had to be careful of.
in the advertisement, it said that Danny brook was staring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing.
for example, once people had to walk from one place to another, but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol-powered vehicles and we can travel faster with them.
the old town is the best place for an afternoon stroll, with a great deal of restaurants, cafés and street performers.
without any doubt, it is a historical place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history during the passing of the centuries.
subject: recommendations for a place to visit
after a long time walking we decided to return and now the weather was so hot we decided to find a place to drink something.
we arrived quite early because we had to work out how we were going to serve people did with which order, so we started putting all the stuff in the appropriate place.
your group has been booked into the palace hotel, which is situated in the city center, 15 minutes 'walk from where the conference takes place.
i had to keep things in place and check that the microphones were working properly.
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall center, from different areas of the city.
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution-i think there will be many such places in a hundred years-and a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
after all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
in wars sailors communicate with mobile phones though places to place to get or give information about themselves and the enemy.
the show is going to take place in the general exhibition hall in London, Thursday the 14 of march, so it could be a good idea to see this show instead of going to the science museum.
although i like camping and sharing with different kinds of people, i'd prefer a comfortable and private place (if it's possible) where i can sleep, or be quiet. i am not a teenager!
i am writing in response to the international arts festival, which took place on 21-22 November.
but the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the "London fashion and leisure show", which will take place in the central exhibition hall, London, on tuesday, March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. at the same time we have to go to the science museum but we would all like to go to the show.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
i helped them to prepare the room for the bands and i decorated the place for the singers.
there was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
it will be good for your group because you don't need to move to another place.
my name is many rodeos and i am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show over the rainbow, which took place in your establishment, the circle theater, which made me feel very upset.
i'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent. and with the tent i can go to another place in the camp.
the whether had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
about accommodation at camp California, i would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the whether is really good and when i am in a tent i feel closer to nature.
we thought that with that beautiful whether the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the whether is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
july is also good because the whether is warm and i could enjoy the time i will spend in the camp more.
finally, what kind of whether is waiting for us?
i would like to know how the whether is in California during the summer so i can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing i need to know is the amount of money that i have to bring with me.
how is the whether in California?
i wonder if you could tell me about the whether and what kind of clothes i ought to bring with me.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of whether it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
in japan, i often play golf but as you know Japanese whether conditions are not good enough for enjoying playing golf, but California has good whether, which means sunshine every day, hopefully.
i would like to ask you about the whether conditions, so i can decide on what clothes to take, and about costs, so i can make a budget for the holiday.
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, please can you tell me about the normal whether for this period?
in the future we won't buy clothes according to size or even color. our clothes will adapt to our bodies, the whether, our fit, all our needs.
'as i have a choice i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on whether conditions.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theater that it promises much more than the people can get for their money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back-my bank account number is enclosed.
i would like to ask whether you have competitions or different activities.
in your letter, you asked me whether the book i've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether there is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
first, the advertisement i got placed emphasis on Danny brook's starring in the show, but actually, a disappointing, unknown actor played his part, and i wonder whether he had real skills.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theater that it promises much more than the people can get for their money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back-my bank account number is enclosed.
i would like to ask you how much money i need, how the weather is, in order to pack the necessary clothing, and whether i need anything else.
finally, i would like to ask you whether there is anything i should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
from my point of view it depends on us whether shopping will be enjoyable or not.
whather there is a phone, a fax or e-mail so i can be in touch with my family.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between these two i'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
in addition, i need to know whether meals are included or not with the accommodation so that i can decide how much i must have with me.
finally, i would like to ask you whether i have to prepare any special clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me.
could you please tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
you can send a letter to your friend by e-mail instead of writing it on a piece of paper and sending it by post.
often people can't buy a piece of bread. and they ask for money from other people.
designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a piece of art and not for everyday purposes.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
when i asked for the piece i was surprised because the assistant told me there wasn't any discount available.
nearly at the end of this letter i have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap piece.
furthermore you had mentioned some discounts in your advertisement, but i had to pay the full piece although i am a student.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full piece, at the end of the season it is half piece. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
regarding the accommodation, i would be pleased to stay in a tent, because the reminds me of my holidays with my family.
thank you for giving me the opportunity.
finally, food shops should be added to the festival next year because only plays and films were not attractive enough to get audiences.
thes modern technology gets closer between person to another person, get close between worldwide, so that, the modern technology changed our daily life so different.
i would like to thank you once again for the great opportunity.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money that i'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me the information i would be very pleased.
so thesis a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in the show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from make-up artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
but after the servile work i met Eminem.
your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracies; the show did not start at 19.30 p.m but only at 20.15.
furthermore you can play with the computer, and unfortunately the fact especially has changed my life.
i'd like you to send the money to the address: UL tallow 10
i'm very happy about the because i spent most of my school life playing sports, especially basketball.
i am really looking forward to the holiday.
in conclusion, i can say that thesis not the biggest problem that the world has and-- it is not my problem because i am not famous!
i think the topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view, because we can study the subject's reactions before, during and after shopping.
thes story happened two years ago.
that is very nice that all costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the u.s.a. and please tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change the activity.
i'm writing the letter to complain about the musical show i saw during my stay in London.
it said in the leaflet that the would be a perfect evening out, while it was not that at all.
now then, how was the advertising, it was completely different. i am really disappointed with your musical. i am asking you for my money back, because i didn't enjoy your musical.
we would like to ask if we could go to the show on the 15th march instead of doing the visit to the science museum.
some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing, that all the time the makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well.
it was great that you organized the arts festival in the city, because people really need the kind of social activity here.
if you have the opportunity one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like the just to get a free pass.
i am very keen on photography so i definitely will choose the as one of my activities at the camp.
in the book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we want something, we can get it, it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it.
in conclusion, the advertisement promised the would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so i would like to ask for my money back.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of thesis that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
i remember when i had the first lesson at the university and the teacher took us to the computer center and i saw these machines, all my colleagues and i were laughing was very difficult to imagine how you can work with the kind of computer.
what kind of an organization do you call the, sir/ madam?
now, it is already possible to send our shopping list by computer, and the option, in the next few years, will become the most common one.
firstly, the environment is polluted because of technology, although thesis our fault.
anyway, in families they usually have the problem that when they buy a new one, suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
i do not have words to express how happy i am. i would like to thank you and camp California for the opportunity.
you wrote an advertisement saying that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit the concert, but there were artists from only 6 countries.
i prefer the accommodation because i think it's easier to meet people when you stay in a tent, near them, than when you stay in a log cabin.
the rest of the activities were very interesting for us, we learned a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people, and all of the without being expensive. i think that the ticket was excellent for us because of its price.
i asked some people in town and the was the best place to choose.
so thesis a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in the show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from make-up artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
and finally, i would have had my dinner after the disappointing musical and thought i would go to 'theater restaurant'.
in the letter you ask me for some further information for my convenience for the strip.
finally, i would like to ask you whether there is anything i should bring on the strip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
i am really surprised for the information because i won, and i would like to say thank you for everything. thes is why i wrote and sent the letter with the information you need i can only travel in July because it is the only time when i can do it before for my work i do not really care what accommodation i will have. i would prefer to come in July i will be available for the moment. i would really appreciate it if you could tell the people who work at camp California i choose the golf and photography because i think i am really interested in those subjects. i am not really really good but i have some experience.
you wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? i think thesis the best choice for him!
thes is something i will never ever forget.
i think that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it isn't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event, and with the ticket you can visit everything you want.
in the letter you ask me for some further information for my convenience for the strip.
the aim of the report is to describe the biggest building of our town.
i am writing the letter to complain about your advertisement for the musical show "over the rainbow", which is misleading in a number of ways.
i made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha's friends with a note: "do not tell Agatha about the. thes is a surprise party for her. please keep the secret!" pat arranged a great DJ and drinks.
we started to put everything on the stage and after the we realized that the band was coming onto the stage near us.
i am very disappointed with the evening and with the disorganized way of dealing with problems so i am asking for my money back.
thes is because i intend to take an examination in September.
nowadays, in the year 2000 we still practice the ancient art but in a different way, we don't use weapons for hunting animals in the jungle, we use the remote to hunt TV shows, and we do not collect vegetables any more, we go shopping.
i would be grateful if you could include the show in your program.
after all of the we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
people are getting more and more addicted to the, because it helps to make everyday life easier and more comfortable.
most of the time he gets lost, or they start playing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... and when the happens you get in a bad mood and you'll have a bad day shopping.
thes was the best part because when everyone was gone, billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginners!!!
the man said it was ok the time and we got in quite easily, we'd made it.
the modern technologies mean i am able to listen the music i've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if i buy a reproduction, i can carry the music everywhere.
in the book, Heathcliff as a child wasn't a bad character, but the situations he lived through with the earns haw family, where he grew up, made him rude, aggressive and noisy.
in addition to the, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
secondly, another problem was the starting time. according to your advertisement, the play starts at 19.30 but instead it started at 20:15, thesis almost an hour's delay.
thes story happened a long time ago.
maybe you think i am exaggerating but recent studies prove that the mania can be really dangerous.
in fact, the activity seems to be very interesting.
when we saw your advertisement for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediately decided that the would be a perfect evening out.
i decided to go to see the show because of its stars, but on the day i saw it, a different actor performed.
in addition to the, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find there.
thes book helps us to improve our logic, mind, and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much.
in fact, i expect a full refund plus compensation for the dissatisfaction suffered. i trust you will give immediate attention to the letter and i look forward to receiving a satisfactory response by return of post within a week.
i used the equipment during the concert, but i was so complicated system.
although i cannot explain any more about the thing i felt during the concert in the letter, i'd like to recommend you to help at a pop concert.
thes part had to be saved for later because the concert organizer wanted to know the exact number of visitors.
there is only one bad thing, that the festival was too short.
we really appreciate your organizing a very nice program, which has been organized by you the time.
the musical should have begun at 19:30, but it started at 20:15; thesis unacceptable!
i am writing to reply to your letter in which you told me i won first prize in your competition, which is two weeks. i was very happy with the result since i did not think i could win.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding the choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
one of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes. our school is now the best in the country in all ages. we are rest with the. we can show what we doing order to be the best.
to make the report easier and faster, it was necessary to make a questionnaire which was given out in the school.
i appreciate the shops for lots of products, cheap prices and big spaces.
i am very indignant because i wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so i would like you to return my money and take note of all the problems.
in answer to your question, i wouldn't change anything because i think that the are the minimum rules that a teenager has to have to be responsible in the future.
definitely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under the circumstances i really believe you should give me my money back.
well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all the reasons i demand to have my money back, i wasted £20 to see a show which doesn't respect the program i paid for.
who got married, who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable change in his complexion, the are questions that most journalists are interested in.
all the years i believed that my father was killed in a car accident.
i was really astonished by all the shopping centers, like Asia, home base, etc.
and regarding the activities, i must choose photography and painting because i am not very good at sports and i think i do well at the things.
thes are only my immature views. if it is considerable for you, i will be very pleased. thank you very much.
if you break one of the rules you could be expelled for a week, a month or forever.
now, you just need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city, with a car, airplanes, shops, all the things without lights.
i might say that i am really good at swimming and sailing because i have been doing the kinds of activities for five years and i have had a really good training in water sports.
i will always say thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the machines which do the washing and the washing-up, before this, women spent a long time doing the tasks.
because we are living a computerized life, we'll be able to do most things at home or the flats'll have the places as well.
i have chosen the activities because the days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favorite hobby.
although, i would have felt better if i had a discount on my ticket, as you mentioned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, the couldn't possibly be given either!
the long queues, crowded places, high prices, sales, all the things combined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it.
thes actors appeared forty-five minutes late according to what is written in your advertisement.
when i was a child i was afraid of all the little insects that live in the ground and this fear still remains now.
because we are living a computerized life, we'll be able to do most things at home or the flats'll have the places as well.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between the two i'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
i would prefer to travel in July. i have only this time, because my summer holidays are during the days.
all the exhibits are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence on our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it.
all synthetic material will be uncomfortable for the people.
i hope you appreciate my letter and that you'll try to amend the problems./ sally sense
closing the facts, when the musical finished i was very, after waiting for the start of the musical and i was disappointed with this version of over the rainbow. everybody went to the restaurant, which was closed without any explanation.
we found the advertisement in a local newspaper and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity, because the show consists of the topics:
thes inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared, but not everyone believes it is really so.
it seems to me that all the failures were your fault, because you were responsible for the organization of the show.
besides that the most important thing is that the children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got psychological problems and they are useful in society.
so i hope the world reaches agreement about this and computer engineers have to prevent the problems because something good could be something very dangerous.
in the galleries there are historical paintings and antique furniture which Chiang used.
all the items of equipment are applications of modern science.
so i feel scared when i think about the consequences if some of the viruses or mad people misuse as happens the days with sex or other.
thes days we can use a computer, television and some sophisticated equipment, which were unusual once.
for all the reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my money back.
regarding the activities i would like to choose swimming and climbing for my activities at the camp; i usually do the two activities on the army camp. i know how to climb up on racial outside and help other people to climb up.
the activities i would like to do during the two weeks are basketball and swimming.
because of all the inconveniences, i ask you for a total refund.
not only the subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, biology and physical training, but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects.
but the days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
i have chosen the activities because the days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favorite hobby.
and because of the circumstances, i would like to have a part of my money back.
in my opinion the hall for the rock concerts was too small. you have to consider booking a bigger one for next year because the kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people.
i don't like thinking of my house or my life without all the facilities.
during the past few decades, or rather in the 20th century, there has been a great deal of development in modern technology.
i remember when i had the first lesson at the university and the teacher took us to the computer center and i saw the machines, all my colleagues and i were laughing was very difficult to imagine how you can work with this kind of computer.
at the swords, Paul suddenly awoke.
and we are practicing the things.
thes days a lot of countries have been worried about lands that can't have enough space to build houses.
thes things are very convenient; on the other hand, there are lots of disadvantages.
thes improvements will be involved by the lack of petrol and non-renewable energy.
maybe it would be a nice idea to analyze the changes and to put limits on technology, because i think that the most important thing is to understand our life and know the ways we can improve it.
technology, are we prepared for the advances?
on Tuesday we have the lessons: English, math, economics and physics.
lastly, i think that all the changes won't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptly.
but it was unpleasant because of the things.
after all the problems i became disappointed.
i think the reasons are sufficient to ask for my money back.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making the clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green peace will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
many years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all the things and they had to work a lot.
thes days the computer is part of your life, you use it all the time. sometimes you do personal and other times it is just the things you need to do like go to the bank, use transport, go shopping etc. it is a machine that makes life easy and endow you can carry it everywhere. it is amazing the way as the FAS the computer changes, the programs are faster and more useful and practical.
all the products of science are with me from the very beginning of my day.
thes are some points i want to mention the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
because of convenience, we can use our time more effectively, but we should not rely on the things too much.
thes days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centers, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of money.
they are just like alcoholics and the people go shopping every day because they cannot stop themselves unless they have not got money to spend.
only those who get good marks can take part in the activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
under the circumstances, as your theater did not fulfil its commitments, i ask you for a full refund and i expect to receive a check for £15, as soon as possible yours faithfully
you know how good i am at music anyway i was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds. at the beginning i was connecting all the wires into speakers, music system, guitars etc... the bit that i particularly liked about the experience was when i was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar-you know how much i love playing guitar-and all the video cameras were just filming us.
because of all the things it obviously wasn't the perfect evening as was said in the advertisement.
all the splay an important role in our daily life without us ever understanding them.
thes days, we're surrounded with so many kinds of products which our ancestors invented.
thes days we are very interested in space and the millennium and things and many designers have shown millennium looks recently.
about the information that you need, i must tell you that i will be able to travel only in July because i have got a new job and i can't ask for more than one month of holidays each year and in the other months i will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays in the months.
i want you to give me back my money. i hope that in future you will correct all the mistakes.
you know how good i am at music anyway i was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds. at the beginning i was connecting all the wires into speakers, music system, guitars etc... the bit that i particularly liked about the experience was when i was standing next to the singers and playing a guitar-you know how much i love playing guitar-and all the video cameras were just filming us.
but we can't stop the technological improvements.
thes are my favorite because they have a lot to do with water, but i like them more than surfing.
we can hardly imagine life without computers, TV sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet none of the things existed seventy years ago.
but in spite of all of the disadvantages, i was pursuing my dreams and objectives and in spite of everything i was going to do it.
i had to become a burglar again and steal jewelry from the jewelers near.
technology improves our lives, we have high-tech equipment for cooking, for work, for study, well near for everything.
the queues are not the only problem. if you go by car there is the problem of parking, if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of career bag career bags during your journey and you won't always be lucky enough to find a seat.

emilio almoner, 18 years old, university student, and the career i have chosen is in international commerce or market.
it doesn't matter what kind of career or job you have.
finally we should give some information also about our tourism, business and computer houses.
besides that, i'm allergic, and that houses me problems when i'm close to nature.
after one hour the whole class had hard about Sarah's secret.
plus, it is mentioned in your advertisement that discounts are available. in fact, no discount was given to me, though i am a student and as a student i was entitled to get a discount but i paid £20 because the cashier had never hard about any discounts for this show.
your program is very good, especially as we can go to visit the science museum, which i hard is very good, but a visit to the London fashion and leisure show would be a good opportunity for us to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up and hairstyles and it is free for students too.
but when we saw our show and hard how loudly the audience applauded them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time. you should try it and see.
when i first hard about over the rainbow i was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when i hard about the extras that the circle theater was offering, it became the best opportunity i ever had to attend a musical of that type, but instead of being the best evening i ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why i am writing to you.

suddenly i hard a noise from my garden and i wanted to know what it was, but it was impossible to do it.
in the paper it was written that the principal actor is "Danny brook" but it wasn't him, it was a different actor whom we had never seen, or hard.
all of them were shocked by what they hard.
today i received your letter. it is the most wonderful news i have hard in a long time.
everyone was enjoying themselves except pat, who had hard about the raid.
when sally hard that, she was very surprised and very excited.
on the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses, but on the other hand they discovered many illnesses which we hadn't hard about before.
immediately after i hard, "and don't forget your homework".
while i was standing on the beach, suddenly i hard someone call my name and say that i had to go home. that is right, it was my mum.
one day when i was there alone, i hard some other kids approaching. i sat down behind one of the stones so they couldn't see me.
when i first hard about over the rainbow i was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when i hard about the extras that the circle theater was offering, it became the best opportunity i ever had to attend a musical of that type, but instead of being the best evening i ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why i am writing to you.
i just knew i shouldn't have trusted her but as i went in the house my dad asked pat to stay for a meal. i was in shock, thinking why isn't anyone getting angry with me? after a while we sat down for dinner and pat just told my parents that i was smoking and when my family hard they got ever so angry.
you know that i'm studying in a difficult school, and as you can imagine you have to work hard and you have to do homework every day.
here is where the good part starts, i was doing the curtains (opening and closing) when Nick came up to me and asked me to go on stage with him. my heart started beating very hard.
it's hard for me even to imagine a situation when shopping is not enjoyable.
how are you? i'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help there and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
Polish students have to study a lot with books and they have fewer practical lessons, and sometimes it's hard to get books or other things needed for studying.
first, i'll tell you that on the day of the concert i woke up at 6:30 a.m., very early for me. you know me, i'm lazy. the work began around 8:30. it was very hard but then the band came to rehearse. from that moment i enjoyed working until the concert had finished. the atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because they understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team.
it was hard work for a while but i was so happy to help at a really big pop concert i can't describe it.
after helping to do that and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before Green Day (the group) left, they came up to us and thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands.
the job was hard, but, from my point of view, it was worthwhile.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine their face clearly.
as you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones i want to do, but i decided to take swimming and photography, because i am very good at swimming and because i am currently attending a photography course in Vienna.
school is supposed to be our second home but it's not. we work hard and at the end of our education we still have nothing.
however, i would add that journalists-being aware of that hard topic-should try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
because of this, the least you can do for us is to give me my money back and work hard so that this theater, which is famous for its beauty and punctuality doesn't become famous for its disorganized shows.
this can be bad too because if i get used to being comfortable, when i need to do hard work i won't be able to.
actually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
the concert was very loud and long but we didn't have to work hard.
i have just received your letter and i'm very happy because of it, especially because the competition was so hard.
it will be good for your group because you don't need to move to another place.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest move famous.
people are used to going to the shopping center because it is easy and familiar. it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch a move after that, and, if you want, buy something at the shops.
i'd love to come airier, but i really can't because this job is very important to me, and i'll need it as work experience for my further studies at university.
earier i had seen an advertisement for the show but the information on it was false.
this invention has made our lives airier and quicker.
homework is airier to do with the computer than with a book sometimes.
finally, with regard to tickets, it is a really wonderful idea because it is more convenient to enjoy the festival for one day among a lot of people.
amoung the greatest inventions of man i come across daily are the telephone, computer and automobile.
it's also a really popular job among university students because of the good salary.
amoung the large number of choices, this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view from the top of its towers, a charming story and one of the most representative examples of Catalonia modernist art.
unfortunately my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us.
amoung them, the mobile telephone, computers, telefaxes, different appliances for the kitchen, machines which help housekeepers to do any work about the house.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the among of money that i'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
in addition to this, i would like to know the among of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find there.
these days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centers, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same among of money.
pat was my big brother, who had heard of some people paying, "safety-money", but never know the reason, until he found a large among of money in my room.
-check your wallet and if you have enough money (a very small among) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Chile, Cuba, Zambia, and morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer low wages for small jobs. you might enjoy your summer holidays and find yourself
could you, please send me some extra information regarding the among of money i should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes i should take.
you will see why i'm describing it as the most unforgettable one when you read thought my letter.
if i feel like talking to a friend i just have to call him and wherever he is i will be able to get thought to him.
now, in conclusion we can see, or i can see, that maybe i am not a very sociable person but i can do whatever i want and take whatever i want only thought technology.
all this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown, particularly when you realize that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way thought the crowds or while you were queuing to pay.
for example, we will have computerized ovens, microwaves and freezers, or we will probably have central heating controlled thought the internet from our office.
i grew up thought the water world and i couldn't live without it.
in the big room where we'll have the party, there'll be some pictures of our college. you'll see all the generations who passed through there.
i asked myself how i could be so stupid, telling her my secret after all i had been going thought to keep it to myself.
in this book, Heathcliff as a child wasn't a bad character, but the situations he lived thought with the earns haw family, where he grew up, made him rude, aggressive and noisy.
as far as i am concerned, the first way modern technology influences me is thought my work: the internet has become such an incredible tool, i can research into everything i want, find information for lectures, for example, or exercises.
our feelings will be transmitted electronically through tour clothes to other people.
i'm writing this letter because two weeks ago i was in London and i went to the theater to see your musical show. and thought seeing it my family had a very disappointing evening and so did i. you can read below my point of view regarding this.
i had a problem with my best friend once when we kept in touch thought e-mail.
we live surrounded by inventions which help as thought the day.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (i am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have thought choice).
but, i got thought it. i had to take care of them during the break, serving drinks, clothes, i even brought them some cigarettes and anything they wanted.
humans have done many things thought the years and made many things possible.
the computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get access to huge informational sources thought the internet, to do shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly.
another thing i dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assistants try to sell any product to the "victim" coming thought the door.
you know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in they couldn't wait to get to the front and they try to go thought very quickly.
what i particularly liked about the experience was the concert was achieved through tour support.
have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want, looking thought shelves and not finding that in the end.
my daily life has also changed a lot thought the use of computers or modern technology.
but even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time thought the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms.
after a few seconds of thought i went straight to pat. "why, why did you do that?"
i thought that any brook, who is my favorite actor, would perform in that show.
and when we understood the internet, we thought that meeting people from other countries and being able "to chat" with them was the height of technology.
as you know, we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country!
i thought i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
then i thought that i should go to the theater restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that i couldn't say that i had wasted my time by coming here.
you know that i always wanted to help at a concert. to be part of the staff would be wonderful, i thought. and i was right!
i read the advertisement and i thought it was going to be a pleasant evening.
i didn't see any discounts available; i thought my son would have paid less than i. as we had already missed the first we went to the theater restaurant, which is famous for its good food, however, it was closed.
we thought that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
you've got more stress, you feel fed up and finally when you get home you think that shopping is not as enjoyable as you thought.
we had never been to a musical show and we thought that it was a new opportunity.
pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined.
i know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what i thought when i was asked to help, but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party wasn't as successful as we thought.
when i received your advertisement concerning the show "over the rainbow" i thought that i'd have a great evening, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me.
i have already thought about a change to the program.
it was a pity but it did not annoy me because i thought that the musical was good enough to pay £20 for.
woods is thought to stand for all white people and this book could have an influence on them.
that evening we didn't want to have our supper before the show. anyway i thought it would be too early to eat and also because the timetable or candidates you give me have say: "visit our theater restaurant after the show".
however, 15% thought that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important.
i hadn't thought about a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, there should have been a luxury restaurant where i could eat.
unfortunately i never thought it could be so disappointing.
i had always dreamt of being near "the cranberries", but i had never thought that the dream could become reality.
i took a driving-theory test last October and i passed it and i will take a practical driving test every soon.
i took a driving-theory test last October and i passed it and i will take a practical driving test every soon.
i only put the speakers in the right places, or helped the engineers test the lights.
it took a long time to test the speakers and the microphones.
there were hundreds of Thai students waiting to take this test.
i came to London for a short holiday to meet new people and to have a test of English culture.
there will be clothes for everyone's test.
this is because people won't give up the great test of food. although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two.
i've always wanted to test the freedom that birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumping in my veins, full of adrenaline, to let myself free, to shake from excitement.
there are also many kinds of take-away restaurants, where i can test my favorite foods.
can you imagine you and your friends going on a picnic to the moon with a silvery skirt with astronaut boots with fire coming out at the bottom of your boots?
the only thing pat had to do was to choose a date, one he liked, and to press the starter bottom, and you know what? he did it!
on the other hand, what might still be the same is to have good places to take a rest at home, such as a beautiful garden, a small terrace.
but what i cannot forgive your company is changing the time it starts at the last minute, my husband is a Danny brook's fan and he felt really disappointed.
i think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
the historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: their freedom.
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, please can you tell me about the normal weather for this period?
i can say that i was very nervous and anxious about what was going to happen.
could you, please send me some extra information regarding the amount of money i should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes i should take.
and please could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes i will have to bring?
i am writing to you to answer your question about school rules and what i am (and i am not) allowed to do at home.
she works as a model, and she was advising him about what clothes, etc., ... to buy for her.
wnat is more, admission for students is free.
a cabin reminds me too much of my home and is too comfortable. that isn't what i want to have if i stay in a wild area.
wnat we really need in the next millennium is love, that is what will keep all the family together forever.
wnat is important is not their fashion but their knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
otherwise, you will either not find what you are looking for, or you will, and spend the rest of the day in a bad mood, because of the bad manners of sales people, who do not give you advice every time you ask for it.
wnat i particularly liked about the experience was the concert was achieved through our support.
i think that this tendency will not change but what will change is life.
the boy could not believe what he was hearing.
since i am going to travel i would like to know how much money it would be advisable to take and what kind of clothing i should take.
these are some points i want to mention the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
when i went he wanted to tell me that from the next month i would be his personal secretary and my salary would be twice what it was previously.
this show would give us a lot of information about current activities, fashion and what is happening here in London with, for example, the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, make-up, and hairstyles.
after one month, i went back home and told my parents what a lot of fun i had with my friends-i don't know why i was such a liar.
wnat do you think about this suggestion?
and please could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes i will have to bring?
before Heathcliff died he achieved what he wanted.
wnat a great idea to invite writers! i really liked talking with them.
because of all this, what was supposed to be one of my best nights turned out to be definitely one of the worst.
i would prefer to do some climbing because that's what i doing my spare time and i do it quite well.
so he climbed on the ladder up to the window and he opened the door but policemen came there "what happened?"
tell me yours. i want to know what experiences you had when you were in England.
i think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
when choosing this style of life they should realize what their life would be like.
they are the main characters of that book, and what characterizes them is the violence of their passions.
if you don't mind i would like to know what kind of clothes are appropriate for the camp and for the Californian weather.
we could find out what this room is like and what the teachers doing this mysterious room.
you can't be careful because you don't know what time it will happen.
i know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what i thought when i was asked to help, but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected.
it doesn't matter who they are, where they come from, what color skin they have.
me and my friend were there to hear the sound-check, and when i understood what was happening on the stage, i decided to help them.
overall, people should think about what it would be like if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need a private life and would like to have an ordinary life.
but if you realize how important what you buy is for your health you will go shopping with a far greater consciousness and more joy than before. '
on the other hand, i would like to know some information which could be useful on my holiday like: what type of clothes would be more suitable for me in the camp?
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do.
secondly, you have a lot of choices and you do not know what to buy.
for example, if i don't have time to do my shopping after school because i have to do my homework, i go on the internet and ask for what i need.
after that "show" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theater restaurant but what a surprise!
could you please tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
in conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depending on what, why, where and who is the person that you are interested in pleasing.
finally if none of my suggestions fit with your expectations, let me know more about what kind of buildings you are interested in and i'll do my best to find something more suitable.
you must have a TV because you can learn about what is happening in the world and you can see some places that you haven't been to.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
the headmaster wanted to tell the police what we had done so we decided to imprison him in a little house we had twenty kilometers away from the village until we could change his mind.
the fans started shouting and whistling for the show to begin, while i just stood there trying to see what had happened.
however, i would add that journalists-being aware of that hard topic-should try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
and what better way to solve this than to give the festival an international character.
of course, what was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening, and i would be very grateful if you could refund me the price of my ticket.
this situation is very annoying for most people, and that's what makes shopping unenjoyable.
3 when you are ready to shop, sometimes you know beforehand what is your priority, because probably you need one thing rather than another.
, what is your name, house, dog, cat, boy, girls etc. i am very happy that i promised myself that i would learn Spanish this summer at Huntington college.
wnat is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipment.
first, on the sheet i received, it says that Danny brook was one of the actors. that is not true, because instead of him, there was another actor, and i don't know what his name is.
finally, i want to know what the weather is like in California in July.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended their friendship with pat because their popularity was damaged.
i would like to ask you, what sort of clothes should i take with me? i don't want to take too much; jeans, jumper, swimming costume, t-shirt, sports shoes i think should be o.k.
first, the advertisement where you advertised your show and what the theater provides is totally wrong.
i was still not very disappointed, because i hoped that i would have a good meal with a glass of wine in the restaurant, which i could have according to your advertisement, but what i did not realize, it was closed, because the chef was in hospital.
wnat depends on us, is the atmosphere we will have in our houses.
before we had a fantasy about how people might travel to other planets, and what we see now is a spaceship cruising in space.
however, i feel that at the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that has been created and it seems that it's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
if you really want to discover what Greek history means, we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum!!!
wnat we really need in the next millennium is love, that is what will keep all the family together forever.
wnat's more, the theater restaurant was closed when the show finished, because the show started at 20:15.
going shopping is a good thing when you don't know what else to do but it also has many disadvantages.
suddenly i heard a noise from my garden and i wanted to know what it was, but it was impossible to do it.
there will be a number of developments in technology in the future, which could make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is the feeling of being together and love.
for example, if we go to a big mall we will probably never find what we are looking for, and instead of buying what we came for we will leave with lots of things that we liked but we will never use.
i would like to ask you for vegetarian food for me as i am a very strict vegan, and to suggest what kind of clothes to bring.
after the stage was built, the rest of the things i had to do were quite easy and enjoyable; i could stay either behind or in front of the stage and give a hand if needed. i really enjoyed it because i learned a lot of technical things i didn't know; and what i also enjoyed was the good pay!
wnat's more, your letter said about the chance to do two activities during the camp.
after all, they'll be the ones that decide what the fashion of the future will be like.
my name is Andre Atos, i am writing to you because last weekend i went to the theater you manage, to see what was called "London's newest and best musical show".
if more and more engineers work in science and technology, it must be because it is really useful: but in what particular way?
it would be scary to live in the new 100 years, but it would be interesting to see what will happen.
secondly, the show began forty-five minutes late and nobody told me what had happened.
also the show started very late compared to what was written in the advertisement.
wnat a catastrophe!
finally, what kind of weather is waiting for us?
nevertheless, after the show i was very hungry so i went to the theater restaurant and what did i see?
with all the dissatisfaction above, therefore, i would like to ask for some of my money back as my evening was not what it should have been.
wnat a pity!
mind what you tell her; she can make the worst of it; gossiping is her favorite leisure activity!
as i am specially fond of musicals, i even travel abroad to see what's new, i am probably one of your most devoted customers. i know this word is not the best but you have demonstrated that the theater can be just as cold as any other business.
guess what i've done!
one of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes. our school is now the best in the country in all ages. we are rest with this. we can show what we doing order to be the best.
regarding what you could doing your free afternoon on the day you leave i would suggest you take the students to our history museum.
in the advertisement it also said you could visit your restaurant after the show, and that is what i did, but when i got there it was shut for no reason.
everybody was interested in what she had won but nobody wanted to ask Sarah because it was told as a secret to them.
i explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and i want you to refund my money and send me an apology for what happened there.
i'm writing this letter to explain to you what happened and to look for a solution.
wnat kind of an organization do you call this, sir/ madam?
if an activity has stayed with us, mankind, for so long, it must give us some pleasure and maybe that's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price marked on it, that is the greatest of ecstasies.
and it is even more difficult to predict what clothes in the future will look like.
i am in doubt as to what kind of clothes i have to bring with me.
wnat was supposed to be a perfect evening out turned out to be a disappointing one instead.
i am writing to complain about what it says in the advertisement is not true.
when you go to a shop it is difficult to find what you are looking for without the help of the shop assistant.
i want to apologize to you, because i haven't written to you recently, but i want to tell you what happened to me last week. i had the opportunity to help at one of the most pop concerts in my city. so imagine, i felt really really good and excited. i don't have words to describe it but i will try to do it, ok?
everybody attended go to the show, funny, and happy in the end, and what have we go then?
it would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could choose what you want to wear by pressing buttons.
as a conclusion to that horrible evening i decided to visit your theater restaurant once the show had finished, but what a surprise when i found it closed.
we could find out what this room is like and what the teachers doing this mysterious room.
everything was very interesting, but what i particularly liked about the experience was the human relations.
actually this was because most things i saw were different from what the advertisement said.
another advantage is that, for example, satellite television, which is an example of modern technology, keeps me informed about what is happening in the whole world.
writing. this class teaches you how to organize what you want to write.
i'm in London for the first time and i wondered what is interesting on your stage: i read in the newspaper the advertisement about the best musical show.
i'm writing this letter to you to make a complaint about the musical show "over the rainbow" which i saw yesterday. i have to say that i'm very disappointed with what i saw because after seeing your advertisement i expected more. the show was entirely different to what it says in the advertisement.
wnat about rooms which can sense your mood and act according to that? if you are tired for example then your stereo might put some relaxing music on and turn down the light a little.
it doesn't matter what kind of career or job you have.
all those inaccuracies spoiled what should have been a memorable evening so i would like to be refunded at least for the price of my ticket.
and that is always what we want.
if not, what do you suggest?
finally, the restaurant where i would have liked to have dinner with friends after the show was closed, contrary to what was announced in the advertisement.
wnat was supposed to be a perfect and enjoyable evening, resulted in a very disappointing time.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
i am writing to you to complain about the differences between what the advertisement for the circle theater said about the musical show called '
pat didn't know what to do. she apologized over and over again and i could really see that she was more than devastated.
wnat do you think models will wear on the catwalks?
in accordance with what you have told me about the accommodation i would prefer to go and stay in tents, because i think they're unusual and that is not something that you do every day.
i was in love with a friend's boyfriend and we were about to have an affair, but when i made the big mistake of telling my little and terrible secret to pat, everything started going wrong. katrin, my friend, and the one i was being bad to, was very upset with me, and she was right, but i really didn't know what to do. i was in love with Brett, but i loved my friend too.
you do not have to wear special clothes, just wear what you always wear.
i start thinking about what she or he prefers and i try my best to buy something appropriate no matter how much money it costs.
however, i can go out whenever i what, even at midnight.
thank you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition. i also what to congratulate you on your excellent competition, thanks to which i have the opportunity to go to California, a place that i always wanted to go to.
as far as i am concerned, the first way modern technology influences me is through my work: the internet has become such an incredible tool, i can research into everything i what, find information for lectures, for example, or exercises.
you have worked hard all day. on the way home you what to pick up some milk from the shop and you have to wait ten minutes on average.
i received your letter and i'm very happy because i didn't expect it, so first i what you to know that i really fancy going to camp California in the u.s.a. for two weeks, especially because i've never been to this country.
during my stay at camp California, i what to go swimming because i practice this activity regularly and i often enter competitions: this is one of my hobbies.
i don't what to be so evil about school but rules are rules and they are limiting us within the borders of our school.
i think that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it isn't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event, and with this ticket you can visit everything you what.
so, if you are looking for a "really splendid science fiction book" i will recommend you to read "a window." and i'm sure that when you finish reading it you will what to read it again, and again...!
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so without what i knew that there was going to be a concert in our city given by, from my point of view, the best group in the world, oasis.
but we could have everything we what.
i don't what to disappoint you, but i am beginner!
i what to travel only in July because now i'm studying at national academy of defense and i don't have time for anything else.
they are human beings and they need to keep a little of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they what to leave home in order not to be recognized.
a cabin reminds me too much of my home and is too comfortable. that isn't what i what to have if i stay in a wild area.
today, everyone has the opportunity to just get into a car and drive wherever they what to.
finally, to fill your free afternoon i would definitely recommend visiting the cathedral and having a walk around the old part of the city. if you what, it will be my pleasure to show you the area.
i hope this letter answers all your questions, if you what to know more about it just give me a call or send me a letter.
as you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones i what to do, but i decided to take swimming and photography, because i am very good at swimming and because i am currently attending a photography course in Vienna.
writing. this class teaches you how to organize what you what to write.
i hope to give you all the information you need and, please, if you what more information or something is not clear, please don't hesitate to contact me again.
i am very grateful and i what to thank you very much for letting me go on this trip.
about the activities that i can do at the camp, i chose to play basketball, which is my favorite sport, because i what to do some exercise while i am on vacation.
and another question is what are the prices of things like there, which i what to know so that i can make a better budget for my trip.
you can come across a very disagreeable shop assistant and if you find what you wanted, you will not what to pay him or her for it.
if i what to discuss something with friends or order a pizza, i can do it as easily as i what, when i what.
i accept and i what to inform you that i can travel only in July because i have booked my annual leave for that period.
i also what to know if i should take any money, or if all the expenses are paid by you.
if i what to discuss something with friends or order a pizza, i can do it as easily as i what, when i what.
so if you what to have a good, relaxing day shopping, we recommend you don't go with your little brothers and to go with enough time to look around for what you really what.
marine's real father wanted her back but the other couple didn't what to give her back because they loved marine so much.
as you can understand, it was a dreadful time and i what my money back as a consolation for the disappointment i had.
the computer is helpful when i what to contact somebody very fast.
and the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and what to have a family, they do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
for those who what something more exciting and adventurous, you are recommended to visit the fun fair and amusement arcade on the top floor of the building.
the other activity that i chose is painting. i am not as good as i what, nevertheless i think i can improve my skills during this course.
the rules must be respected by all people if you don't what to be kicked out of school.
i thought you were a good theater, where people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else, but really i am very disappointed and i what to ask for my money back.
do you really what to know about my experience helping at the pop concert in our town?
there are hundreds of programs which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger who you what to meet.
first i what to thank you for all the congratulations, and i'll try to answer all your questions about, for instance, travel and accommodation. i have to tell you that it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at that time.
yeah folks, that was the point i got interrupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but if you what to hear the end of my story than buy the "rossall-school-magazine", next issue, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.
now, in conclusion we can see, or i can see, that maybe i am not a very sociable person but i can do whatever i what and take whatever i what only through technology.
such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world, even if i am not at home; i use a stereo if i what to listen to my favorite music; i use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, etc.
despite my lack of experience in climbing i do what to try this type of sport.
also, i what to say that the plays and films were excellent, but there weren't enough of them for me.
i what to know if i can take my cellular phone, too.
so i what to ask for my money back, also i had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisement.
finally, if you what to visit this building i would recommend you stay at a hotel not far from the memorial hall called the Hyatt hotel.
i what to apologize to you, because i haven't written to you recently, but i what to tell you what happened to me last week. i had the opportunity to help at one of the most pop concerts in my city. so imagine, i felt really really good and excited. i don't have words to describe it but i will try to do it, ok?
i what to know your opinion.
the other activity is photography. i am not an expert, but i know how to use a camera. all i what is to improve my knowledge.
unfortunately, the musical show wasn't much like that the one the advert had described, and that is why i what to ask you for some money back.
and i what to know how much money i have to bring for personal expenses.
and i what to know more about the money. can you give me more information about the money that i need to bring with me?
the rules at home are very different. i am allowed to do what i what as long as i study enough to prove.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got three buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried what to study in my college and you what tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about classrooms it very big and comfortable.
i would like to ask you what sort of clothes should i take with me? i don't what to take too much; jeans, jumper, swimming costume, t-shirt, sports shoes i think should be o.k.
finally, i what to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theater to cheat your customers. if you do that, there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them.
i what to thank you for preparing such a good program for us and especially for taking us on the river trip to Greenwich.
i what you to give me back my money. i hope that in future you will correct all these mistakes.
the perfect evening you promised in your advertisement was the complete opposite and that is why i what to get some money back from you.
i what to know if it is available at that time.
it would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could choose what you what to wear by pressing buttons.
i don't what to be rude, but this is not professional at all.
i what to know some information about it.
the big secret was that Anna was preparing a surprise party for her brother john and she didn't what anyone to know about it.
if you really what to discover what Greek history means, we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum!!!
recently, some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London. it will be on the 14th and we all what to go.
so while i am at the camp i what to take a lot of photographs and climb a mountain.
first i what to talk about the computer.
when you are tired after looking around you might what to buy drinks or something to eat, or if you are fed up with historical things, you might as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you what it faster and colder.
in conclusion, i don't what to change anything in my house or at school, because i totally agree with the few rules that i have.
for instance, when i what to contact my friend, it's quite helpful to use e-mail.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something they what to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes they even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
i what to apologize to you, because i haven't written to you recently, but i what to tell you what happened to me last week. i had the opportunity to help at one of the most pop concerts in my city. so imagine, i felt really really good and excited. i don't have words to describe it but i will try to do it, ok?
nowadays, there are more and more people who what to become designers and the competition is increasing.
i what to suggestions for the last day. you and your group could maybe go to green park and visit the queen's house and parliament, this area is very nice and the group would enjoin after the conference to get some fresh air. another option could be the new tell gallery. i have never been there but it could be a good excuse to visit it with you.
if i what to know how a friend is, i just have to phone him; i can see how the world is getting on just by switching on the television, and i can cook in a few minutes using the microwave oven.
hello! i am very pleased that i have won the first prize in your competition and i what to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your camp in July because that month i usually have a rest and now i am thinking about it.
to sum up, everything you doing small quantities is good and fun, but don't increase the amount you do if you don't what to feel uncomfortable.
i know that staying in a log cabin is more convenient but i just what to have a wilder experience.
sometimes, i think i am a computer addict because whenever i come back home, my hand goes to the computer switch, automatically, even though i don't what to use the computer.
i explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and i what you to refund my money and send me an apology for what happened there.
i really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they go into a shop they what to try on every single item of clothing and they do not realize the time.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got three buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried what to study in my college and you what tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about classrooms it very big and comfortable.
especially if you what to buy clothes with your girlfriend or if you are a girl, you have to be ready to spend hours trying on clothes.
if it is possible i what a log cabin for my accommodation because i have been suffering with my back since my childhood, therefore i need a comfortable place to sleep.
they what too much from student and are unkind to them.
furthermore, when you look around the supermarket, you can't easily find the goods which you what to buy.
i what to complain about your advertisement for the production 'over the rainbow'; i had a very disappointing evening.
furthermore, for the activities i what to select tennis and basketball because i have been playing tennis since i was young and basketball because i played for the team in my college as the captain.
these are some points i what to mention the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
if i what to discuss something with friends or order a pizza, i can do it as easily as i what, when i what.
definitely, i what my money back as soon as possible.
how are you? i'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you what to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help there and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
furthermore, it's a worthwhile experience for people who what to know about other countries 'arts.
i guess they will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because they what to change.
for all these reasons, and if you what to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my money back.
finally i what to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
if you what to hear more of my suggestions and opinions about it please contact me on my cellphone.
that evening we didn't what to have our supper before the show. anyway i thought it would be too early to eat and also because the timetable or candidates you give me have say: "visit our theater restaurant after the show".
firstly i what to congratulate you on the festival.
you are interested in my last job! i really what to tell you all about my experience.
tell me yours. i what to know what experiences you had when you were in England.
one of the reasons that i have visited your arts festival was to see a lot of plays. in the future, i hope to be an actress and that's why i what to learn something from the professionals.
another reason is that it will be more useful for foreign students who what to speak English.
probably it is one of the moments when you what something badly and you can't have it.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they what.
have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or what, looking through shelves and not finding that in the end.
another point that i what to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theater restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
this is the main reason why i what to ask for a refund.
now, in conclusion we can see, or i can see, that maybe i am not a very sociable person but i can do whatever i what and take whatever i what only through technology.
i'm very good at swimming as i have been a member of various swimming clubs since i was 6 and i chose photography because i have a new camera and what somebody to teach me how to use it.
but also i'm aware that time flies for me. i must do whatever i what before it is too late.
in addition to this, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we what to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
i really recommend you to help them, i think this is a good opportunity and i what you to understand my feeling well.
so if you what to have a good, relaxing day shopping, we recommend you don't go with your little brothers and to go with enough time to look around for what you really what.
so i what you to send me some money back for that unpleasant night.
the principal reason i'm writing to you at the moment is that i what my money back, because i felt so disappointed with the theater and also with the play.
finally, i what to know what the weather is like in California in July.
in this book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we what something, we can get it, it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it.
i what to tell you that i am very disappointed about the play.
and that is always what we what.
and in conclusion i what you to give me my money back, (i still have the advertisement if you what proof of what i say).
i have happily received your reply and i what to thank you for this marvelous prize you have given me.
of course if you are in the public eye, the reasons why you what privacy are different, because if you are a politician, for example, you fear for your life.
and in conclusion i what you to give me my money back, (i still have the advertisement if you what proof of what i say).
i always what to buy t-shirts, jeans, skirts, cosmetics, hairbands, accessories, rings, earrings, bracelets, shoes, hats, bags, fancy stationery, interior stuff and CDs.
personally, i think it could be a great opportunity because it is something we all what to attend, and we are all interested in the latest fashion.
that is because, i do not what to seem fussy, but i like to have some luxuries when i am going on holiday and i think sleeping on the floor without electricity may annoy me.
people are used to going to the shopping center because it is easy and familiar. it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch a movie after that, and, if you what, buy something at the shops.
i am really disappointed, and i what to have my money back.
that evening my father said a few words: 'may this be the end of your career as a that; we are only ready to forgive if you promise never to start again'
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have that problems, that affairs, that private lives just as normal people do.
this was the reason why we were in horrible trouble with the place.
basically, i helped them liaise with the local place and get some electronic equipment that they needed.
then the place realized who the bank robbers were and arrested them.
the headmaster wanted to tell the place what we had done so we decided to imprison him in a little house we had twenty kilometers away from the village until we could change his mind.
i walked alone a long distance until i found a telephone. i called the place and they ask for a rescue.
but pat could not resist the temptation to call the place.
the mother was shocked. she didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going in and out the places. it was a nightmare but fortunately the place found her.
when i asked for the place i was surprised because the assistant told me there wasn't any discount available.
nearly at the end of this letter i have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap place.
furthermore you had mentioned some discounts in your advertisement, but i had to pay the full place although i am a student.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full place, at the end of the season it is half place. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full place, at the end of the season it is half place. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
another thing is that i took a particular amount of money to buy tickets and when i appeared in front of the ticket desk i found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the real place weren't the same, the real place was much higher.
in my opinion famous people are being obliged to pay a place for being famous that, in some cases, costs more than they deserve to pay.
however, i would add that journalists-being aware of that hard topic-should try to moderate what there write in order to respect other people's privacy; since there would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
i was very nervous because i'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't help it and i started crying-you can imagine, there were so handsome that i couldn't believe it-i tried to calm down because i had to work, and later i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very fast-although i was working-and it was like a dream.
thery always did things together, and there were the most popular boys in school. both were very handsome, played football; there were an example for everybody.
but are there useful in every situation and everywhere?
i would suggest there wear formal clothing, such as tie, trousers and blazer.
i only had to stay behind the drummer supplying them with water whenever there wanted.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse their show. i could see how there really improved, and how nice there were with the staff.
thery were so poor that sometimes there hardly had anything to eat.
thery were drawing a lot of things in the sky during the concert.
that makes those people frustrated and there don't enjoy themselves.
we are all customers of the big supermarkets. thery have all that we need.
are there included in the prize?
the theater restaurant was closed after the show, there said funds had run out.
i was shocked and terrified the first time i saw them, but the truth is that there are men like us.
on the development, there also said that there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty-five years old but that was totally wrong because i paid the full price, which was £20.
1) first, there are located in the center of Rome so there can take a bus to get to them move and around the city.
a lot of countries buy guns, for their defense there say, but there buy them to kill people.
finally, there got separated.
then there take a shower and everybody goes for breakfast.
personally i prefer to stay in log cabins because there are much more comfortable than tents.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse their show. i could see how there really improved, and how nice there were with the staff.
well on march 11th there was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", there sing pop music. and there are one of my favorites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favorite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
thery become lazy because there know that there can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a button.
you know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in there couldn't wait to get to the front and there try to go through very quickly.
so her friends didn't realize that she knew about the party and there were very happy because there believed that the surprise party had been a success!
so we don't have to worry about how heavy there will be.
what i realized was there were not different from any of us but there were called celebrities.
the people who were there to watch the show were very angry and there were shouting because there had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
the things that really disappointed me were that you said Danny brook and Tina truelove were the actors but there weren't, different actors played and to be honest there made the whole show very bad.
thery can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, there must be very good people, because "fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this world.
thery are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because there cannot stop themselves unless there have not got money to spend.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then there solve their problem all together.
finally when we had seen the musical, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because there were doing some decorating, and you wrote in your advertisement, "visit our theater restaurant after the show"
to sum up, although i think there ought to abandon their lives partly when there enter the world of fame, there should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
these inventions have improved our life a lot since there appeared, but not everyone believes it is really so.
so her friends didn't realize that she knew about the party and there were very happy because there believed that the surprise party had been a success!
you know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in there couldn't wait to get to the front and there try to go through very quickly.
most of them believe that there are kind of crazy or evil.
thery have a very simple life and behavior when there aren't on the stage.
thery can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, there must be very good people, because "fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this world.
the advertisement said that there would be available but there were not.
but after there separated, he told his friends her secrets without thinking.
i guess there will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because there want to change.
at first nick got angry but then he forgave him because there were friends and each of them could trust in the other.
also the sports activities should be filmed; there express an aggregate and social way of living school life and can be useful to show the movements of the bodies during the school athletics events.
our ministers are really criminal. thery often break the law, stealing money.
the new inventions have transformed my life, so it is easier with modern technology (the mobile, the car, the plane, the coach, the train, the medical advances and domestic appliances), there have created more comfort and pleasure.
synthetic materials have developed and become very popular so there would keep going.
the people who were there to watch the show were very angry and there were shouting because there had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
thery also gave me a ticket to watch the concert live.
some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing, that all the time this makes you feel complete and also there think that if you are famous you are special as well.
people won't wear warm clothes anymore and there will certainly be synthetic, because there won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
in particular, going to the museum and the art gallery will be a great opportunity for all of us, as there are world-famous places in London.
another disadvantage is that everyone becomes a bit more lonely because there watch TV or play or work on the computer and don't see each other anymore because there don't have to.
actually, there put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell.
that will be great because teachers are part of our life and there have to receive all our attention and friendship because if it wasn't for them we would never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidently and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget.
after all, there'll be the ones that decide what the fashion of the future will be like.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, there are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively-thery can often visit their friends and travel much more.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, there are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively-thery can often visit their friends and travel much more.
i have been hearing about the ave there have in the exhibition, it is interesting.
thery don't fancy going into the crowded shop.
the aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resort buildings which were built 10 years ago. thery are some of the first buildings that were built with the latest technology and designed by an important Mexican architect.
to sum up, although i think there ought to abandon their lives partly when there enter the world of fame, there should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
after helping to do that and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before Green Day (the group) left, there came up to us and thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands.
first, when i paid my entrance fee there didn't accept my discount ticket, there told me that the ticket was fake, then i entered the theater and i had to wait 45 minutes. the show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15, "this shows a lack of respect".
but for their considerations, there're working in their routines.
when the sons were old there began to talk about their life, beginning with this story, which happened a long time ago.
in Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and there aren't very strict.
thery stopped me having the operation.
those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable, but there take us away from our friends, our families and moreover there lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything that surrounds us and keeps us alive.
it all started when pat, Nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his house. most of the class disagreed with that because the pat's house is extremely little, there started to say to him that his house was like a box.
at the concert there were very successful because there were very confident and i helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic.
thery are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because there cannot stop themselves unless there have not got money to spend.
i really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when there go into a shop there want to try on every single item of clothing and there do not realize the time.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because there can afford it and there don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
because the world is now a global village people will wear at least one item of traditional or national clothing (for example a peasant jacket or hat), like there do now in rural areas from time to time.
with regards accommodation i would prefer log cabins, as there are more comfortable and i like convenience.
this is a good opportunity to see how there learn in class.
i think, next we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion there are the most interesting classes apart from the FCE class.
anyway, in families there usually have this problem that when there buy a new one, suddenly there have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
thery are always attracted by naughty journalists, which have a desire to earn big money for writing an extremely good report or article.
it'll be a good point for her general education. wuthering heights is a classic, which everybody knows about, even if there haven't read it, there at least know the story.
thery are imported from another western European country.
and the difference is that those children are effective when there grow up and want to have a family, there do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
children are not studying as much as there ought to, because there are watching TV, talking on the phone or even playing computer games.
everybody will wear anything he/ she likes, choosing clothes from any century there wish without this being strange.
thery are just wasting time on it.
thery were just playing and, by accident, Peter shot him.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if there do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures, because although there are famous there also have their private life.
although i read that stars and artists came from around the world, i realized that there only came from six countries.
what i realized was there were not different from any of us but there were called celebrities.
when choosing this style of life there should realize what their life would be like.
thery are more comfortable and really match with the environment.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money there get from advertisements, reports about their last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
marine's real father wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to give her back because there loved marine so much.
moreover, men prefer to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, which is contrary to the tastes of women, because if there have any free time, there will go shopping.
i think that the cabins are safer than the tents and there can protect you better in case the weather changes.
thery mixed up our traditional music and pop music.
thery were eager to have a child, but there had never been able to.
however, 15% thought that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and there mentioned it as not really important.
but there don't consider the problems the rumors may cause the famous family or couple.
in my opinion famous people are being obliged to pay a price for being famous that, in some cases, costs more than there deserve to pay.
so there prefer to leave their sons watching TV.
maybe there will be in many colors and there will be very tight.
her parents have been so upset that there have asked the school to help their child and that is the reason why i'm writing this story.
painting always did fascinate me, even though i'm not so good at it, but my friends say i can really paint and there love the things i do. the technique i like the most is watercolors.
thery liked me so much and invited me to be responsible for the lights and sound.
on the whole, being rich and famous doesn't always bring happiness, whereas the majority of the population wish there were rich and famous.
although this statement is absolutely true, it seems there is no way to stop public attention, so there will have to keep living with journalists.
thery are also the lessons which English people and other foreigners are particularly curious about.
in answer to your question, i will have to say that i can only go to the camp in July because of my job; there only gave me that month off.
i quickly became bored by this hypocritical attention there gave me.
i just knew i shouldn't have trusted her but as i went in the house my dad asked pat to stay for a meal. i was in shock, thinking why isn't anyone getting angry with me? after a while we sat down for dinner and pat just told my parents that i was smoking and when my family heard there got ever so angry.
thery could not believe their eyes.
however, secondly, famous people are not "alien" so there might do something, for example, shameful things in a public space, or argue with a partner or family, even put on a swimming costume like us.
thery can relax, reduce their stress and there are happy when there find the thing which there wanted.
but soon everyone in the class was looking at me smilingly and i found out that i had many unsuspected friends... not long after, there were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed going shopping, others going to the cinema and a restaurant.
children are not studying as much as there ought to, because there are watching TV, talking on the phone or even playing computer games.

in the advertisement 'discounts available' was written. shall i ask you one question?-why weren't there available?
it is true, there deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time, however this publicity brings them money, and a comfortable life.

to sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects there study, but it should concern their sports activities as well.

some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously, maybe just a bit too seriously. thery gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or members of other gangs, trying to start fights with them.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so there are looking everywhere, pushing you because there think that you will take the shirt that there want.
thery taught me specially.
often people can't buy a piece of bread. and there ask for money from other people.

but when i hear the word future, i have an image of metallic colors so that in my imagination there are wearing metallic or brightly colored clothes.
after that there changed the principal actor, the one that replaced him was very bad, that made us really angry.
i guess there will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because there want to change.

most of the time there have journalists following them everywhere, looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper, and i don't think this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because there are popular.
i think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if there are pushing you), to understand what there like and what there don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.

first there talk about the environmental pollution which cars and other vehicles create, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some other problems.
one day when i was there alone, i heard some other kids approaching. i sat down behind one of the stones so there couldn't see me.
jane explained that situation and there understood her.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before, and some women don't earn money. thery have no idea how difficult it is to earn money.

thery have a very simple life and behavior when there aren't on the stage.
thery are human beings and there need to keep a little of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that there are unknown and anonymous and there do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time there want to leave home in order not to be recognized.
about a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, there cooked their food on the fire and there didn't have pens.
in addition to this, you may have some robots bringing the newspaper to the table, tidying up the house, and doing the shopping. maybe there will also be your life partners.
i am not talking about some kind of achievements in those disciplines but there are my big passion
thery can relax, reduce their stress and there are happy when there find the thing which there wanted.
also, that there will invite a psychologist, the author of the book and maybe the president will talk so i recommend you listen to it.
thery can also talk with British students to communicate study experience.
1) first, there are located in the center of Rome so there can take a bus to get to them move and around the city.
anyway, in families there usually have this problem that when there buy a new one, suddenly there have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
anyway, we definitely know that there're going to change.

well here in Dublin things are still the same, but i think somebody told you that i went to the Moby concert here at the point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. i guess it was the best concert i've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard? well he told me that there needed people to put everything on the stage, so i went to help them and everything else, and when i got to the point, do you know who was there?
a log cabin would be the ideal accommodation. presumably there are more spacious than tents and it would be easier to keep tidy.
at the concert there were very successful because there were very confident and i helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic.
at the end of the video, we should find one or two students sit together and ask them a few questions about how there feel about studying at the school? this is the suggestion to making a daily life video in school.
thery become lazy because there know that there can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a button.
well there didn't accept my £20 discount ticket. why?
thery promised me that there would call me someday, which i particularly doubt.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and there develop their own styles which suit them the most.
i helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and there even let me play with their guitars!
thirdly, in your advertisement it said that discounts would be available, but there were not.
it doesn't matter who there are, where there come from, what color skin there have.
i think the people who enjoy shopping are greedy for materialistic things and there haven't any interests in the spirit (?), in the intellectual life.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because there can afford it and there don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
i always prefer to read books that are unusual in some way, because there give me the opportunity to escape from everyday reality.
shopmania is really unstoppable. i know women who do everything there can to buy only a dress, or even worse, women who buy things there have no use for, for example, snap, sculptures, kitchen tissues, or everything sold by telemarketing that really is useless, but there cannot resist the fact of it "being there."
i went to buy a ticket and as i like to enjoy the show near the stage i bought a £20 ticket but when i asked for a discount there told me, "i am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement. it will be impossible to give you a discount".
so there can be just ordinary people like us.
the best thing to do would be to show the cooking personnel because there are very nice.
i really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when there go into a shop there want to try on every single item of clothing and there do not realize the time.
thery always did things together, and there were the most popular boys in school. both were very handsome, played football; there were an example for everybody.
and it's always interesting to watch others while there do something like that.
thery will be comfortable clothes because the main point for any kind of clothing is to be comfortable.
those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable, but there take us away from our friends, our families and moreover there lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything that surrounds us and keeps us alive.
when i got to the theater i asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but there were not available.
as well will have the responsibility of looking after my brother when there aren't at home.
first, when i paid my entrance fee there didn't accept my discount ticket, there told me that the ticket was fake, then i entered the theater and i had to wait 45 minutes. the show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15, "this shows a lack of respect".
basically, i helped them liaise with the local police and get some electronic equipment that there needed.
firstly, i would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an international arts festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it said that i would find stars and artists from around the world, when, in fact, there were from only six countries.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something there want to have, there will do everything there can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes there even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.

poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, are created too. thery have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming their brain and their bodies, and it can also cause death.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between these two i'd prefer to stay in tents because there give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
shopmania is really unstoppable. i know women who do everything there can to buy only a dress, or even worse, women who buy things there have no use for, for example, snap, sculptures, kitchen tissues, or everything sold by telemarketing that really is useless, but there cannot resist the fact of it "being there."
the advertisement said that there would be available but there were not.
suddenly there all shouted "surprise!".
it is as if there lose their conscience while there are shopping.
i think that it is very dangerous because the famous people cannot have a private life and consequently there may suffer from depression and sadness, which may lead them to suicide.
to sum up, although i think there ought to abandon their lives partly when there enter the world of fame, there should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if there do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures, because although there are famous there also have their private life.
the staff in that department were really friendly and helpful and there were also huge, like giants.
thery are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jealous.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when there can buy something new for their cars, motorbikes or computers.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when there decided to move to London, there invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
it may, in many cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and there had to know there is no private life separately connected to it.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something there want to have, there will do everything there can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes there even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
for the end-of-conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and there will provide us with live music and catering.
many years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all these things and there had to work a lot.
future students could appreciate coming if there could still do their sport.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if there don't get their pay first.
i can find cold water in the refrigerator but 50 years ago there didn't have the refrigerator, so our life is easier today.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when there decided to move to London, there invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i had put some money aside for that month, thinking about the discount, but when i went to buy them there said that discounts were not available.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something there want to have, there will do everything there can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes there even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
it doesn't matter who there are, where there come from, what color skin there have.
it is as if there lose their conscience while there are shopping.
if somebody wants to be famous of course there must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her.
in a supermarket, shop or department store there have many things.
when there finished singing the last song i was surprised when there called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people.
but technology has not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us things that can make our lives more comfortable, it has also created things that aren't bad, but if there are in the hands of the wrong people there can destroy the world.
these are my favorite because there have a lot to do with water, but i like them more than surfing.
and what about those kinds of intellectual and progressive people, don't there all wear the same type of ugly but comfortable shoes?
more and more people buy mobile phones, because there are very useful, you get a lot of possibilities like: using the internet, buying different goods, booking tickets, controlling your home technic and many others.
some people when there are tired relax by sleeping, reading a book or watching television, but not me.
thery found him two months later and six months later he was in jail.
i had a discount ticket, but there refused it and i had to pay the full price.
thery believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because there will be outgoing, amusing, etc.
regarding the accommodation, i would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in and there aren't very cozy.
sometimes there give up, before there get something,
in accordance with what you have told me about the accommodation i would prefer to go and stay in tents, because i think there're unusual and that is not something that you do every day.
at all schools there is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, there are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the Calder center, which is a very special bath center.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
thery are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity. you should close the theater until the restaurant can be used.
thery are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
thery were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
english: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there.
thery are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
i'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're there.
on video there should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that there can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, there were none.
first, there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, there was only one hour left to install the different colored lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so there was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be there and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, there was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, there were only six nationalities.
apart from that, the show was delayed forty-five minutes, consequently, everybody there lost control and became angry.
she was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a trade center there.
thery are some things i would like to ask about: the type (and quantity) of clothes i will have to take, and if it is necessary to take some money or any additional stuff (like raincoats).
from there to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus, which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town center.
then, i was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! i, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificent events.
the activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
you can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert. apart from the musicians and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security... it was so exciting!
thery, Jacob approaches him slowly and tells him.
are there any discotheques or something? i would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her i can't be there.
i went to buy a ticket and as i like to enjoy the show near the stage i bought a £20 ticket but when i asked for a discount they told me, "i am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement. it will be impossible to give you a discount".
firstly, this is because there are a lot of scandal magazine readers.
all my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but i personally think that it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
thery is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
could you please let me know where i will eat? if there will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
it's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freely, and there are no teachers. it could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons.
for the accommodation at camp California, i would prefer to have a log cabin because i think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case there is a big storm with heavy rain. a log cabin's more resistant than a tent.
it's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them i like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if i have to make a choice, i choose climbing and surfing.
to make matters worse, we have never had the opportunity to see Danny brook because, instead, there was a different actor!
finally i want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because there aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
i don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so i am rather puzzled about what to wear there.
i don't think that i'd enjoy it, all the people kicking you, you can't walk properly or buy anything. and also there are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops. i mean that some people can fight to get something.
an international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die there were stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
the advertisement also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
you will find there an amazing collection of old weapons, armor and, we are especially proud of it, the great collection of swords.
thery is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only day-off you have to buy something you like.
if you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that there are incredibly big differences between them.
in addition to this, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
first, i got there at 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and i needed some time to buy the tickets. i bought two tickets for £20 and when i asked for a discount, they didn't give me one, then i was kept waiting for the show to start until 8:15 pm.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be there, my favorite actor, but there was someone else instead of him.
i didn't need to pay an entrance fee because i was working there.
what is more, you advertised there were discounts available but there were not.
thery was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
if Danny brook does not appear, you have to say something about this to the people who are there in the theater. this is your unforgivable mistake.
thery were no discounts available so i overspent.
i stood at the entrance and there i had to check the tickets.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that there would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
and the theater restaurant was being painted, so i could not go there.
it's not that problem that there was no more discount available-but i had chosen it, because i'm (allowed?).
and the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
it is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot.
also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes there are planned visits to historical places.
thery are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
the task was not easy, at 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it. thery was nothing to lose.
because of it our state can't pay workers in schools, hospitals, on building sites. in our country there is a high number of unemployed.
however, i feel that at the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that has been created and it seems that it's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
i am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while i am there. because of my studies, i will take painting, as this is the subject which i am finishing at college, always with important qualifications, and photography which has been my hobby since i discovered that i can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
first, there were no discounts available such as were promised in the advertisement so i had to pay the original price which wasn't cheap at all.
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall center, from different areas of the city.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still i'm happy, that i could be there.
thery are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in their private life.
from there you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, which both take you very close to the conference center, and also you can go by underground to get there.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get their pay first.
also it was written in the advertisement that some discounts were available, but there weren't any discounts.
they decided to build more schools, especially in Switzerland because the people there were considered clever.
but when we got into the house there were all my friends!
in fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and i would be grateful if you could give me back a part of my money.
thery were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisement.
but there was a little problem and it was that my parents didn't let me go to discos alone, so i had to go illegally, and i decided i would do it.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the center of the town because there are many places to have a look at and go shopping.
likewise, there were no discounts available.
history: at the castle there are always a few guides, who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle (when it was built, by whom and why), which makes everyone enthusiastic.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so there was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
is there a possibility of exchanging different currencies to us dollars?
at the camp, is there a free uniform or will we have to wear something special?
in the advertisement you say that there is a discount available but there was not.
i prefer that kind of accommodation because i can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but i can't have it in a tent.
if you have never been there, i really recommend you to go.
thery is no need to bother about clothes.
how are you? i'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help there and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
the performances were great, but some halls were too small to accommodate all the people who were there that day.
at the end of the conference there will be a reception at the hotel.
thery are eye-max cinema, museums, a gallery.
i love sports so i would like to play some basketball at the camp. by the way, my team and i won the last school championship. i play guard on my team. i also like tennis but i am not very good. i was wondering if you could give me some lessons while i am there.
the advertisement promised there would be my favorite star, Danny brook, but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theater restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
in your advertisement you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately i found out only six countries were represented.
but you can't play if there is too much wind, because the ball becomes uncontrollable!
sometimes, there are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
in my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity: i live on a little mountain at 160 meters altitude so i cannot go to the city using a bicycle. because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and i need a good personal computer with a modem and the internet to study or do research, because there are not any bookshops to buy or borrow books in my little town.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel three, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
actually, i read the advertisement for the show and there were a few mistakes in it.
thery were lasers all over the place, which i had to be careful of.
the advertisement promised there would be my favorite star, Danny brook, but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theater restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
thery is a great opportunity to go there because students need not pay anything.
because all the smells in the market are awful-thery is the smell of the meat and dirty water, black and smelly water, all over the market street.
the people who were there to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
people won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certainly be synthetic, because there won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be there, my favorite actor, but there was someone else instead of him.
it was also written in the show's advertisement that there would be discounts available on the tickets.
finally you said there was a restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything until we got home.
after all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad. i think i can only forgive your theater if you give me a refund of the money i spent there, and some more for all the problems i had.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether there is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find there.
and now of course there will be someone trying to improve it.
well on march 11th there was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favorites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favorite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
thery has been a change in the relationships between people.
when pat first came into a class or a group of teenagers there were no problems.
thery are huge queues to the tills, noise, hassle, poor customer service.
i had read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there weren't.
i had read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there weren't.
so, after all of that, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice that the restaurant wasn't open.
in Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict.
firstly, you advertised that Danny brook, who is my favorite, is the lead but there was another actor instead of him.
i was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, that was not exactly the case: there were no discounts available, such as were mentioned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; i was then very disappointed to see that Danny brook had been replaced by someone else.
for example there were no discounts available and the theater restaurant was closed after the show, when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance.
to sum up, there is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of money, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
also, i want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but there weren't enough of them for me.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are many kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on make-up and how to have appropriate hairstyles.
and the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
finally i want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
moreover, once i was paying for the tickets, i found another thing out: there were no discounts available.
secondly for us there are disadvantages because pollution affects us indirectly, and because i don't do anything but watch television, and it isn't very good at all.
i think it is very convenient for the group. you know the Victoria area, it is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city. about the hotel, it is clean, and provides a good service. the rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting good value. and the best way to get to the college for the conference is to walk to Victoria station, get the tram to cluster road and after 3 blocks on the left-hand side you will find the college.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
it is easy to get there and free admission.
also there is a very good shopping center next to the museum.
me and my friend were there to hear the sound-check, and when i understood what was happening on the stage, i decided to help them.
thery is a very big library.
when we arrived, there were a lot of people, the place was beautiful, all seemed perfect.
i would like to stay in a tent because i used to go camping at weekends but if there's any problem i could be very comfortable in a log cabin too.
the concert was on a Sunday and we had to work at the back of the stage, doing all sorts of things like collecting rubbish and helping other people who were working there.
the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, which i have arranged for you.
i'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there are many challenges in your new career.
thery will be clothes for everyone's taste.
the show's date is very convenient-march 14-, and it is on in the central exhibition hall so i do not think it would be a problem to get there.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that there would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
unfortunately, i was very disappointed to find out that there were no discounts available!
thery is a great opportunity to go there because students need not pay anything.
nowadays, there are more and more people who want to become designers and the competition is increasing.
firstly, there will be leisure and sports wear and the latest fashions.
for example, we can't go to the restroom during lessons. we have to go there in the break.
however, there is something about which it is still believed that it was an extremely important invention.
firstly, there is the aquarium in the building.
the advertisement also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
but your stars were not there.
i am still a student and i saw in the advertisement that there were some discounts available.
the history of the human race is the history of world conquest. that said, technology has advanced continuously since the beginning of man's evolution. furthermore, during the last two centuries, there has been an enormous technological explosion. while the xix century gave us the steam engine, factories and the electric light bulb, this century has given us nuclear energy (and sadly atomic weapons), the computer, the internet and television.
i am sending you some pictures, the best ones only because there were some quite embarrassing ones.
another point that i want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theater restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
finally, i would like to ask you whether there is anything i should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
other workers are taking on other months so there is only July that is available for me.
on the other hand, if human society changes to become stricter and more limited, there will be only 2 or 3 types of clothing, formed by the needs of society.
maria spent all day thinking about who told them that. thery were two possibilities: one, her best friend Becca, or her sister pat.
thery is also Hercules Poirot, the famous detective, and he finally solves the mystery.
i know i'm a "daughter of this technological world" and unluckily i think i couldn't live without it: it's rather strange that today there's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... but, sometimes i ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one.
also, we will take the drinks from our canteen and there will be a group of musicians for our entertainment.
finally, i want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theater to cheat your customers. if you do that, there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them.
what is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipment.
i'm very proud to be the winner of your competition! i have never been to such a camp before and so i'm looking forward to spending two weeks there.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about their last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
that's so good when you have the money to enjoy it but, apart from that, there are many problems.
also there is a big problem: the money.
we build big cities, there is hot and cold water, electricity, gas in practically every home.
i've read your advertisement and the reality was different to what was written there.
thery were two other problems: there were no discounts, contrary to the information in the advertisement, and the theater restaurant was closed because of the repair work.
thery was always a lot of security stuff around us to make sure everything was ok, because there really were thousands of people.
that's why i believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to avoid boredom. i am sure that eventually we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free. thery won't be any problem with being up-do-date.
and what's more, there weren't any discounts available and the theater restaurant was closed: the only people who could enter were the actors and the staff.
these things are very convenient; on the other hand, there are lots of disadvantages.
moreover instead of buying a ticket i went there for free, as a helper.
in my early childhood my mother said to me that when she was a little girl there was only one telephone in the building where she lived.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
and then about the tickets, you wrote that there were discounts available but there were not.
i don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so i am rather puzzled about what to wear there.
pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined.
i have never enjoyed doing shopping, but nowadays there are some people who are called shopaholics.
in my opinion, we can have a great time there, and entrance is free of charge for students, which is very important as well.
while i'm staying there i would like to practice tennis and basketball, as i have been playing both sports all my life, and i have to say that i am very good at both.
we think that this is a great opportunity and we are all very interested in going because we can see there the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, a lot of different kinds of make-up and some famous hairstylists.
it has always been my dream to go there and to be able to see that beautiful country.
the advertisement for the musical said that it was going to be Danny brook. unfortunately there was someone else-an actor who i do not like and if i had known that he was going to be there i would not have gone to see him.
another thing was that there were no discounts available, and that the restaurant, which i wanted to visit after the show, was closed because of the main cook sickness.
surprisingly, there were no discounts.
thery were some people around but i was afraid to ask them the way.
the queues are not the only problem. if you go by car there is the problem of parking, if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of carrier bag carrier bags during your journey and you won't always be lucky enough to find a seat.
thery is nothing more disagreeable than that.
for example, there were some concert halls which were too small to hold so many people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for the audience.
in the advertisement, it said that Danny brook was staring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing.
so, if possible, i was interested in the possibility of continuing my routine there.
thery are always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from their offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
the weather had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
as we are going to be in London on this date, we think it could be a great opportunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions, make up, etc. and it is free for students.
i was sure there was someone on the other side of the wall.
in the advertisement you say that there is a discount available but there was not.
travelling in July, i have to say, would be perfect for me because my birthday is on the 24th of that month and i wish to spend my birthday in the best way possible, so that means there.
i want to suggestions for the last day. you and your group could maybe go to green park and visit the queen's house and parliament, this area is very nice and the group would enjoin after the conference to get some fresh air. another option could be the new tell gallery. i have never been there but it could be a good excuse to visit it with you.
that means that there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you, no one to talk to and no one to complain to.
when i asked for the price i was surprised because the assistant told me there wasn't any discount available.
i told you before Elton john performed at that concert, so there were a lot of famous people.
shopmania is really unstoppable. i know women who do everything they can to buy only a dress, or even worse, women who buy things they have no use for, for example, snap, sculptures, kitchen tissues, or everything sold by telemarketing that really is useless, but they cannot resist the fact of it "being there."
the rooms will be designed in a futuristic fashion, where there will be less furniture and everything will be compact. even sets will be on the ceiling.
i would prefer to sleep in a tent because i think it's different from where i sleep every night so i would appreciate it if there are still tents available.
in the advertisement for the show you said that one of the stars was going to be Danny brook, and to my surprise there was a different actor, and that really disappointed me.
on the other hand there are disadvantages, too.
thery are so many varieties of products, different prices, different qualities.
i went to buy the tickets but when i paid there was not any discount available.
secondly, there will be exhibitions about makeup and hairstyles.
first, on the sheet i received, it says that Danny brook was one of the actors. that is not true, because instead of him, there was another actor, and i don't know what his name is.
thery i was impressed by how a singer can cause such hysteria in teenagers.
the fans started shouting and whistling for the show to begin, while i just stood there trying to see what had happened.
during these past few decades, or rather in the 20th century, there has been a great deal of development in modern technology.
one day when i was there alone, i heard some other kids approaching. i sat down behind one of the stones so they couldn't see me.
in the advertisement it also said you could visit your restaurant after the show, and that is what i did, but when i got there it was shut for no reason.
i am very pleased that i was born in a time when there is such good technology but my parents didn't have the same luck.
i would like to know if the,, travel costs ''which you had paid include entrance tickets to the museums or any other cultural places, because i would like to do some sightseeing in the u.s.a. furthermore, if there will be my tumble dryer or washing machine to clean our clothes and if there will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp.
thery are several points i have to complain about which meant the evening was not nice at all.
also there are some free headphones that explain the history of the museum.
moreover there will be a demonstration of modern make-up and new different, shaking hairstyles.
to begin with, in your advertisement you say that Danny brooks will be starring in the show but instead there was a different actor, which made us very disappointed.
and so far there weren't any discounts available which were said to be "available" in the advertisement.
thery are also restaurants and modern galleries.
thirdly, the advertisement said that discounts were available but the ticket seller said that there was no discount allowing or available.
on the development, they also said that there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty-five years old but that was totally wrong because i paid the full price, which was £20.
thery are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficult.
thery are more and more retailers opening.
thery were two other problems: there were no discounts, contrary to the information in the advertisement, and the theater restaurant was closed because of the repair work.
thery are hundreds of programs which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger who you want to meet.
perhaps, there will be personal computers which will control everything, every item of furniture, light, temperature.
in the big room where we'll have the party, there'll be some pictures of our college. you'll see all the generations who passed through here.
thery should be an interview with students and with professors.
apart from the main hall, there are also lots of other galleries.
then, after the conference, there will be a formal party at the group's hotel, which starts at 9:00 pm and finishes at 12:00 midnight.
moreover, there weren't any discounts available like writing in your advertisement.
to sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable, but don't worry, the shopping center is still there waiting for you!
moreover, the stars and artists were from only six countries. in my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more interesting, and in my opinion, some of the concert halls were too small. the people in there couldn't even go to the loo, because it was too crowded.
finally, i must choose travelling there in July because i am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work.
we really got bored, like all the other people there.
someone is talking, laughing, crying on there, so join them. you will feel much better than you would just by yourself.
i explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and i want you to refund my money and send me an apology for what happened there.
i think that fashion in the future will develop along very different lines: there may be a return to the fashion of the past, as we can notice now, or a more fantastic and technological development.
the queues are not the only problem. if you go by car there is the problem of parking, if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of carrier bag carrier bags during your journey and you won't always be lucky enough to find a seat.
thery are also many kinds of take-away restaurants, where i can taste my favorite foods.
probably in the future we may be too busy to go to our own home and spend some time there.
because there are a lot of beautiful trees and you can see the sea.
the advertisement says that Danny brook and Tina truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because i was looking forward to them.
lastly, there is a recycling problem, which many people do not care about.
as you can see, there are some (deliberate?) mistakes in the advertisement you made.
the activities that i would like to do are singing, because my friend told me that i'm good at it, and the other activity that i would like to do is climbing because i think it is very exciting although i have never tried climbing, because there are no mountains in my city.
first, the actors that the circle theater publicized on their tickets for over the rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
the London fashion and leisure show is an amazing show because there are parades with the latest fashions. we could see some famous top models. also there will be a variety of clothes either sports wear as elegant designs.
i think this festival is a great idea because it's an opportunity to see and to appreciate art, but i also think there are some things that could be changed.
is there only one teacher for each sport, and how many are in each group?
amazingly, we can find that there are more and more computer users.
thery was no Danny brook but instead of him there was a different actor and i'm very disappointed about that because i'm a fan of his.
first, i can come there only in July because of my examination, i have to take it in June, and my new term will also start in September.
for example, if Diana, who was the ex-wife of Prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparazzi when she was dating a man, there wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death.
but also there are some notes that you should improve in next year's festival to make it absolutely wonderful.
i have mentioned a few changes above but there's still the biggest one left, which is related to the field of computers.
i was very nervous because i'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't help it and i started crying-you can imagine, they were so handsome that i couldn't believe it-i tried to calm down because i had to work, and later i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very fast-although i was working-and it was like a dream.
in the Pompadour center, there are different exhibitions on different themes.
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution-i think there will be many such places in a hundred years-and a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
the advertisement for the musical said that it was going to be Danny brook. unfortunately there was someone else-an actor who i do not like and if i had known that he was going to be there i would not have gone to see him.
however, i think there will be some differences in the quality and materials of clothes.
at school you aren't allowed to bring in connected mobile phones although there is more than one student that does.
and is there anything else i have to take with me?
according to your advertisement i could have one but in reality there were no discounts at all.
surprisingly there was a completely different actor starring.
so he climbed on the ladder up to the window and he opened the door but policemen came there "what happened?"
are there any discotheques or something? i would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her i can't be there.
however, there was one person who told me he wasn't happy at all with the phone, because he used to write a lot, especially at Christmas when he wanted to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phones him, ending a very old tradition.
furthermore the style of the clothes is going to be more crazy and individual but there will still be numerous clothes for conservative people.
what is more, you advertised there were discounts available but there were not.
the London fashion and leisure show is an amazing show because there are parades with the latest fashions. we could see some famous top models. also there will be a variety of clothes either sports wear as elegant designs.
thery are the natural materials on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produces more and more synthetic materials, which relay on the production cost.
last but not least there are some things i would like to know: what kind of weather do you have in California?
when you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place, all trying to find the best prices and not caring about anybody, this could drive anyone crazy.
thery were hundreds of Thai students waiting to take this test.
we waited there for forty-five minutes for it to start!
when i go to bed, because there are many mosquitoes, i turn on a special machine with a battery-like thing in it which kills them.
i'm excited to be going on holiday there and, thanks to you, i will realize a dream that i always wanted to do.
thery are so many monuments in California and so i will remember this holiday with my photographs.
all my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but i personally think that it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
inside the museum there is a bookshop with a large variety of historical books, maps etc.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this three-day program in London and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.
thery is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
because nowadays, wherever you go there is a big queue and i hate waiting.
finally, there are a lot of museums in our town. therefore, i would suggest going to the frogs museum, which is really fascinating.
it was a nightmare, there were pickpockets in the shop.
on the one hand there are the materials from which the pcs are made, on the other hand is the huge waste problem.
i hadn't thought about a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, there should have been a luxury restaurant where i could eat.
that is forty-five minutes later! it is also advertised that there were discounts available. however, that was another lie.
you wrote an advertisement saying that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit this concert, but there were artists from only 6 countries.
the most exciting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert, and we went to the highlands to spend the whole day there.
in these galleries there are historical paintings and antique furniture which Chiang used.
we think that we could go there on the 14th of march, in the evening, instead of going shopping.
thery are a number of hotels or youth hostels to stay overnight, if necessary.
the third problem was that it was written that discounts were available, but when i got there it was not true.
according to the advertisement you published, there should have been some important differences to the production i saw.
after this competition there was mathematics, and two hours of biology.
thery are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
the group has been booked into the palace hotel, and the best way to get from there to the conference is by tube. the location of the conference is then five minutes by foot.
the price was excellent because there wasn't any time limit.
i strongly recommend you to use public transport in order to get there, because you may find other types of transportation quite expensive.
the first problem happened at the box office because there were absolutely no discounts available.
fortunately, there are many ways to earn some money nowadays.
can you please give me some recommendations about the clothes i will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget.
i was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when i was there i saw another star that was completely different from your brochure.
in fact there would be only one possibility in July because i will finish my exams at the end of that month and begin vocational training the 1st of august.
thery was no Danny brook but instead of him there was a different actor and i'm very disappointed about that because i'm a fan of his.
it is not always easy, but there are rules in every home and you have to respect them.
and another question is what are the prices of things like there, which i want to know so that i can make a better budget for my trip.
what is more, there was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, there were only six nationalities.
i have further ideas. in the future, maybe in 2113, there will be houses like now but with more technical things.
thery was no discount at all, which was in contrast with 'discounts available'.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from their relations with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
i would like to know if the,, travel costs ''which you had paid include entrance tickets to the museums or any other cultural places, because i would like to do some sightseeing in the u.s.a. furthermore, if there will be my tumble dryer or washing machine to clean our clothes and if there will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp.
shopping is not always enjoyable. sometimes there is a long queue or a machine is broken.
whether there is a phone, a fax or e-mail so i can be in touch with my family.
although this statement is absolutely true, it seems there is no way to stop public attention, so they will have to keep living with journalists.
thery will be a number of developments in technology in the future, which could make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is the feeling of being together and love.
however, i hope, there is water and light inside this log cabin.
thery are many things that can go wrong in the process of acquiring a product or service.
thery, i saw the exhibitions and admired the building itself.
last of all, it says in your advertisement that there is a theater restaurant open after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was being redecorated and no announcement was made.
and then about the tickets, you wrote that there were discounts available but there were not.
in my opinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking the Piccadilly line.
it was a surprise when we were told there would be another actor.
but other people don't think like this. for example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost.
the play should have started at 19.30 but it started forty-five minutes later, we were waiting there without anything to do.
although there are new machines etc., medicine makes many discoveries thanks to research into different diseases in order to make the population live longer.
if there is no chance to go to California in July, i could wait until next summer.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green peace will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
both of them are as convenient as getting there.
by problems i mean that the show started at 20.15 and not at 19:30 or why there were no discounts available?
well here in Dublin things are still the same, but i think somebody told you that i went to the Moby concert here at the point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. i guess it was the best concert i've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard? well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage, so i went to help them and everything else, and when i got to the point, do you know who was there?
thery was always a lot of security stuff around us to make sure everything was ok, because there really were thousands of people.
after a few minutes the dream happened: karate guitarist-appeared over there.
it started from got up in the morning, we have the machine help us to cook, iron, cleaning, washing, and then we went out to work, there are car, sky train to travel for help us convenience and quickly.
when we arrived at the theater we realized that there were no discount tickets available as were mentioned in your advertisement so we had to buy the most expensive ones.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so without want i knew that there was going to be a concert in our city given by, from my point of view, the best group in the world, oasis.
but there is always a lot of traffic at all times, and the air is so polluted that i can't even breathe.
thery were also the discounts which weren't available.
i actually enjoyed it working there and i wouldn't hesitate to work there again.
i'd like to have more tests during the whole course, not only at the end, because it's making me very lazy.
i came to London for a short holiday to meet new people and to have a tests of English culture.
i am writing to tank you for notifying me about the competition and i would be very grateful to give to you the information that was requested in your letter.
thnk you for your time. we're looking forward to hearing from you soon.
thnk you for your letter. i was so happy to receive such good news that i couldn't believe it.

firstly, i'm writing to tank you for the great opportunity you are giving us, especially in planning all this program in such an accurate way.
thnk you very much for your attention on my behalf
the whole class and i would like to tank you for the good program which you have organized for our trip to London.
first, we would like to say tank you very much for organizing our tour around London and our program, which is considered especially good for us because of the places we will visit.
thnk you very much!
first i want to tank you for all the congratulations, and i'll try to answer all your questions about, for instance, travel and accommodation. i have to tell you that it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at that time.
i am really surprised for the information because i won, and i would like to say tank you for everything. this is why i wrote and sent this letter with the information you need i can only travel in July because it is the only time when i can do it before for my work i do not really care what accommodation i will have. i would prefer to come in July i will be available for the moment. i would really appreciate it if you could tell the people who work at camp California i choose the golf and photography because i think i am really interested in those subjects. i am not really really good but i have some experience.
i am very grateful and i want to tank you very much for letting me go on this trip.
we believe that the program is very good and well organized and we would like to tank you one more time especially for that.
i decided to tank pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a lesson.
can you believe it, it was Moby. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he gave me a t-shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the Moby concert and everything, tank you.
thnk you for the effort which you have made to organize this three-day program in London and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.
thnk you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition. i also want to congratulate you on your excellent competition, thanks to which i have the opportunity to go to California, a place that i always wanted to go to.
thnk you for giving me this opportunity.
first, we would like to tank you very much for organizing such a wonderful trip with an interesting program.
i received your letter, which says i won the first prize in your competition-two weeks at camp California in the u.s.a. i appreciate that and i tank you sincerely for having chosen me as a winner.
i'm writing to answer your questions but, first, to tank you for the prize.
i would like to tank you for choosing me.
i have happily received your reply and i want to tank you for this marvelous prize you have given me.
with reference to our trip to London, on behalf of all of us, the English class in this college, we would like to tank you for your special attention in organizing a good program to learn about the interesting and cultural places in London.
on behalf of the class i would like to tank you for the excellent program you have organized, especially the idea of visiting a gallery.
i am writing to tank you for your letter confirming that i won the first prize in your competition.
i have just received your letter and i tank you for your invitation and congratulations.
i am writing to you to answer your question about the conference in London. thnk you for your letter.

thnk you for your letter, as usual, it's a pleasure to receive news from you.
thnk you for any detail more i think we go with you and enjoy a fantastic program.
firstly, i would like to tank you warmly for this great prize.
i am writing to you to tank you for your very good organization of the international arts festival, where i spent two excellent days recently.
thnk you for your attention and understanding.
thnk you for your letter, which arrived yesterday.
i would like to tank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competition for two weeks at camp California in the u.s.a.
thnk you for your letter.
first, we'd like to tank you for the program you have already arranged. it's wonderful because it covers most of our interests.
thnk you very much for your cooperation.
i received your letter this morning. thnk you very much for your kind letter and for choosing me.
again we're so sorry that we are causing you inconvenience regarding your plan and tank you for considering us.
thnk you very much for your offer.
before answering your letter (which i have just received) about the prize for the competition i recently won, i'd like to say tank you very much for giving me the chance of going to the USA.
thnk you for this prize, i'm really excited and emotional.
when they finished singing the last song i was surprised when they called me up on the stage and said tank you to me in front of hundreds of people.
as we have seen the advertisement for the program the school arranged for us as a farewell activity, we are very appreciative and would like to tank you for your kindness, as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other class, which we have hardly done at all.
thnk you for the excellent program you have organized for our class.
i will always say tank you very much to the inventor who has invented the machines which do the washing and the washing-up, before this, women spent a long time doing these tasks.
for your last day i tank it would be interesting to visit our historic and famous city center.
as for the colors, i tank metallic colors, especially silver, will be the most popular.
i tank in the near future we need to decide with the government
maybe you tank i am exaggerating but recent studies prove that this mania can be really dangerous.
and it is responsible for many changes in my life, and i tank i wouldn't be able to live without it anymore.
i tank going shopping in a big space like Harrods is not a pleasure.
i tank that competitions should be filmed because my school is a kind of sports school.
everything that we do now we do with a computer: it helps to look after the house, to perform very difficult operations, because the computer can tank much faster than a human.
when you tank of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accessories etc. and buying them.
although we cannot deny it is our nature-we are curious-we can improve our sense of morality and try to tank about the importance of privacy for them.
life is too short to tank about possessions.
i tank i can handle it very well.
i tank the people who enjoy shopping are greedy for materialistic things and they haven't any interests in the spirit (?), in the intellectual life.
when it comes down to color, i tank it'll be much brighter and maybe glittery.
regarding accommodation at camp California, i would prefer to stay in a log cabin because i tank it is safer than a tent.
in conclusion, i tank that technology has two faces which affect my life as well as everybody else's life.
most of the time they have journalists following them everywhere, looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper, and i don't tank this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because they are popular.
concerning the accommodation-please be informed that i would prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i tank that the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities-i have chosen tennis and photography.
i tank it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
for special occasions, for example a party, a concert, people will dress very smartly. i tank that it will be dresses, and suits sewed by the well-known tailors.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got three buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i tank somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about classrooms it very big and comfortable.
furthermore i would like to choose to stay in a tent instead of a cabin because i tank it could be more exciting and could provide more contact with the environment.
i don't tank i have done such a bad thing as to destroy our friendship.
but other people don't tank like this. for example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost.
i tank that the government have to protect them and their private life from the journalists, by punishing journalists.
i have just received your letter which made me so happy. i cannot believe that i won first prize in your competition, because i have always believed i am an unlucky man and now i tank some things are changing in my life.
overall, people should tank about what it would be like if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need a private life and would like to have an ordinary life.
we tank that we could go there on the 14th of march, in the evening, instead of going shopping.
i tank i'm not bad at painting either; at least everyone in my family likes my work, including myself.
that is because, i do not want to seem fussy, but i like to have some luxuries when i am going on holiday and i tank sleeping on the floor without electricity may annoy me.
about the size of houses, i tank that in cities houses will be more and more small because of overpopulation.
i mean i don't tank we'll change cars into airplanes...
it was really a new job for me, but i tank i did well.
moreover, i have chosen this month because i tank the weather will be fine.
because of all this trouble i tank we should have our money back.
i tank it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as the annual sports tournament or welcoming evening for new students.
i also tank that the log cabin will be much more comfortable than the tent.
students tank that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything special.
regarding the accommodation, i would prefer a log cabin. i tank that will be safer for all my things.
now, my English teacher has asked me to explain what i tank.
log cabins may be more comfortable. on the other hand i tank that i will be able to "survive" in a tent.
about the accommodation, i tank i would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent, since it is more comfortable.
then i realized that Danny brook did not appear in the show, which was very disappointing for me because i like this actor very much, and i tank that i was not the only one who was upset.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i tank i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favorite and skillful hobby: sailing.
in the end, i asked for i money back (and payment for my horrible night): do you tank anybody will give me something back?!
in my opinion, small shops and the street markets should be supported. on the other hand, the big supermarkets should tank more about the recycling problem, which will be the most important problem in the near future.
i tank after 100 years, at least something will change as regards design, material, color, etc.
i tank these reasons are sufficient to ask for my money back.
and referring to the question about which type of accommodation i prefer, i choose a log cabin, because i tank that a tent is messier, so i would appreciate it if you give me a cabin.
great fun, very happy, if go with your girlfriend it will feel romantic, you should tank something like this, but do you know it is not always like this?
i tank you can do a lot more things now than before with technology.
regarding the accommodation at camp California, i prefer to rent a tent, which is going to be more fun, i tank, but are the tents singles?
another point which i tank was annoying was the concert hall.
with reference to the accommodation i would rather stay in a tent because i tank it is the best way to socialize.
i tank that some of the changes have been very good, like the improvement in medical science, which now can save millions of people that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives.
i tank that life without modern technology would be simple and boring. that's why i am using it in my daily life. i am happy that there is such a thing as modern technology.
think about the computer, the speed of computers is much fatter than before.
in my opinion it's a lot better than the dictionary because it's fatter and you really find what you need.
for example, once people had to walk from one place to another, but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol-powered vehicles and we can travel fatter with them.
everything that we do now we do with a computer: it helps to look after the house, to perform very difficult operations, because the computer can think much fatter than a human.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it fatter and colder.
now i have a new computer, which is very easy to use, and comfortable for my fingers and also fatter.
industrial wheel going fatter and fatter.
the computer is our way of communicating with the outside world, whereas with airplanes we can reach our parents and friends easily and much fatter than we would if we used boats or trains.
cooking has become fatter with the help of the microwave.
besides this, the information goes fatter than it used to know and it's available at the same time in every part of the world.
industrial wheel going fatter and fatter.
these days the computer is part of your life, you use it all the time. sometimes you do personal and other times it is just the things you need to do like go to the bank, use transport, go shopping etc. it is a machine that makes life easy and endow you can carry it everywhere. it is amazing the way as the FAS the computer changes, the programs are fatter and more useful and practical.
we can also use technology to produce more food and help them grow fatter.
to make this report easier and fatter, it was necessary to make a questionnaire which was given out in the school.
first i want to thank you for all the congratulations, and i'll try to answer all your questions about, for instance, travel and accommodation. i have to tell you that it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my fatter is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at that time.
when one day pat came over to my house, we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fight the subject of my fatter and his problems suddenly came up.
that evening my fatter said a few words: 'may this be the end of your career as a thief; we are only ready to forgive if you promise never to start again'
my fatter always remembered his responsibility was to provide his workers with a good salary, which is the aim of his life.
my golf teacher is my fatter and i've only played in a practicing center, but my fatter and his friends say i have good talent for golf.
my golf teacher is my fatter and i've only played in a practicing center, but my fatter and his friends say i have good talent for golf.
anyway, in families they usually have this problem that when they buy a new one, suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and fatter or parents and children.
i told pat that my fatter and mother were going to separate.
i can come to USA in July because in august i will be working with my fatter.
all these years i believed that my fatter was killed in a car accident.
marine's real fatter wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to give her back because they loved marine so much.
i was surprised that my fatter didn't watch me but i soon understood that he was ignoring me.
first she said to her fatter, then to her mother and finally to her brother, that i was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion kilometers from earth and then i was so ashamed because i have been her boyfriend since i came to earth.
not only was i a member of the swimming team in our school, but also i had been taught by my fatter since i was five years old.
i am deeply disappointed with the service and the unreliable information at your theater.
i like to sleep in a tent under the open sky since i have done military service, therefore i would prefer a tent as my accommodation.
i am writing to complain about your service.
another point that i want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theater restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
after this introduction, it will be time to show some of the activities everyone can do at the school, such as lessons or others like the library, our protagonist having a coffee with some colleagues in the café bar, the reception service.
as you may understand it was not a perfect night and i was not pleased with the show or even with the service.
there are many things that can go wrong in the process of acquiring a product or service.

i could say that we cannot service without them.
since man became man he has needed to hunt to service. in ancient times he used spears, bows and arrows, and the woman's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff.

i think it wouldn't be possible for us to service without electric light.
log cabins may be more comfortable. on the other hand i think that i will be able to "service" in a tent.
they are very useful things which sometimes are necessary to service.
in conclusion, from my point of view, people must learn that despite technology being such a new area to explore, we have to use it with a great deal of responsibility for us all to service in the future.
eventually i like shopping too and i believe everybody likes shopping, but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough money to service.

most of the time they have journalists following them everywhere, looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the from page of the newspaper, and i don't think this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because they are popular.
after the stage was built, the rest of the things i had to do were quite easy and enjoyable; i could stay either behind or in from of the stage and give a hand if needed. i really enjoyed it because i learned a lot of technical things i didn't know; and what i also enjoyed was the good pay!

the reason why i'm writing to you is the class and i have seen an advertisement for the London fashion and leisure show on tuesday, march 14 from 10.00 am-7.00 p.m.
before it was packed into by the audience, we had to clean around the reception, but totally it was really exciting although i was just a member of staff in the small reception, because i felt great excitement (especially girls!) from people queuing.
about accommodation i would prefer a cabin, because i suffer from allergies, and i think a tent would not be very suitable for my health.
well, about rules in my country, the situation is not different from other countries.
in order to prepare it i visited some classrooms during the lessons and i interviewed a number of students from our school.

first, on the set i received, it says that Danny brook was one of the actors. that is not true, because instead of him, there was another actor, and i don't know what his name is.
however, i would add that journalists-being aware of that hard topic-should try to moderate what the write in order to respect other people's privacy; since the would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
i was very nervous because i'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't help it and i started crying-you can imagine, the were so handsome that i couldn't believe it-i tried to calm down because i had to work, and later i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very fast-although i was working-and it was like a dream.
thet always did things together, and the were the most popular boys in school. both were very handsome, played football; the were an example for everybody.

i don't want to be so evil about school but rules are rules and the tare limiting us within the borders of our school.
for men and women appearance is important and the spend a lot of money buying clothes, cosmetics, accessories, jewelry etc.
also in the advertisement you wrote that discounts were available, but the weren't, and also that people could visit the theater restaurant after the show to eat something or to have a drink.
red-hot chili peppers came here for a short time and the played at the "chemical hall".
more and more people die from some illnesses whereas a long time ago fewer people died from the same illnesses, despite the fact that the had fewer medicines.
i think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if the tare pushing you), to understand what the like and what the don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
another disadvantage is that everyone becomes a bit more lonely because the watch TV or play or work on the computer and don't see each other anymore because the don't have to.
sometimes, there are so many people and the tare not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
it would be my suggestion to the producers of this video that the should focus on our writing and culture lessons.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if the do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures, because although the tare famous the also have their private life.
the people were wonderful, the were helping each other with everything and it was a lot easier to do.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from their relations with journalists because of their work, the really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
there are always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from their offices and the just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
but technology has not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us things that can make our lives more comfortable, it has also created things that aren't bad, but if the tare in the hands of the wrong people the can destroy the world.
i really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when the go into a shop the want to try on every single item of clothing and the do not realize the time.
anyway, in families the usually have this problem that when the buy a new one, suddenly the have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
when the finished singing the last song i was surprised when the called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people.
thet were eager to have a child, but the had never been able to.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as the tare constantly followed by reporters, which makes their life miserable.
i feel that the would be fabulous places with a western design.
yesterday when i arrived at college, i saw pat standing with peter and a lot of other boys and the were looking strangely at me and laughing.
but we should not forget that the tare only tools and should emphasize human relationships.
it doesn't matter who the tare, where the come from, what color skin the have.
most of the time he gets lost, or the start playing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... and when this happens you get in a bad mood and you'll have a bad day shopping.
thet want too much from student and are unkind to them.
lastly i would like to inform you that i wanted to have dinner at your restaurant but the told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock,
you can inform all the students that the can take some traditional food to the party.
thet are human beings and the need to keep a little of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that the tare unknown and anonymous and the do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time the want to leave home in order not to be recognized.
the things that really disappointed me were that you said Danny brook and Tina truelove were the actors but the weren't, different actors played and to be honest the made the whole show very bad.
besides that the most important thing is that these children have an easy adolescence and the haven't got psychological problems and the tare useful in society.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training the enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, the have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because the tenable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
it would not only emphasize the sharp contrast between this and the classroom atmosphere but also show how the tare as young people.
people used to wear very different things from the clothes we wear now, we wouldn't even say that the tare 'clothes'.
all of them were shocked by what the heard.
in order to fulfil their readers 'requirements the constantly follow them.
but about the differences between the homes of the rich and poor, the twill be the same in the future.
women, in particular, have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything the see.
thet are very useful things which sometimes are necessary to survive.
on the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses, but on the other hand the discovered many illnesses which we hadn't heard about before.
i was sure that discounts were available because i had read that the were, but at the ticket office the didn't offer them.
thet are human beings and the need to keep a little of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that the tare unknown and anonymous and the do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time the want to leave home in order not to be recognized.
in the advertisement 'discounts available' was written. shall i ask you one question?-why weren't the available?
it is true, the deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time, however this publicity brings them money, and a comfortable life.
the real thing was that i had to look after them because without me the would have been lost.
afterwards we could let people talk with the artists so the could get to know them personally.
i particularly liked listening to their musicians when the played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc.
everybody gets up at six, and the first thing the do is run for about two thousand five hundred meters.
thet are much more comfortable than tents.
but, on the other hand, people will still have to program them, as the have to do nowadays.
thet were worse than the previous actors.
to answer our first question about where i would prefer to sleep, i prefer tents because the tare closer to nature and i like sleeping in sleeping bags (= BV bags).
i was promised that after the show i could go to the theater restaurant but due to the show starting late it also finished late, therefore, when i went to the restaurant the were definitely closed.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training the enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, the have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because the tenable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
i met a lot of different people and the tall taught me something new about behavior or compassion.
for example, if the shop is full of people, it is not enjoyable, because the twill create too much confusion, too much noise with the risk of wasting time.
thet're fighting for the same reason with the same strength, the man has to kill a brother, as he calls the fish.
thet will become less dark and more comfortable than today.
and sometimes the do something in the library by themselves in the afternoon.
'as i have a choice i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because the seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions.
to sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects the study, but it should concern their sports activities as well.
you are never going to believe what i did last month. i was walking with my sister in oxford circus, when suddenly a man stopped us saying that he was looking for people to help at a concert and the were going to pay us five pounds an hour.
some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously, maybe just a bit too seriously. thet gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or members of other gangs, trying to start fights with them.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so the tare looking everywhere, pushing you because the think that you will take the shirt that the want.
thet taught me specially.
often people can't buy a piece of bread. and the task for money from other people.
in conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and the tare more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depending on what, why, where and who is the person that you are interested in pleasing.
i walked alone a long distance until i found a telephone. i called the police and the task for a rescue.
thet promised me that the would call me someday, which i particularly doubt.
according to my job, i had to help the teams with the outfights and, of course, it was my first professional experience: in the end i felt like one of them, because the were so kind to me, and i could help a lot and i learned a lot with this project.
in the past people didn't have electricity and if the wanted, for example, to read or to cook something the used to light a fire.
maybe the twill be in many colors and the twill be very tight.
we were also surprised to discover that the student discounts weren't available for us, because the didn't accept our student identity cards from Switzerland.
but when i hear the word future, i have an image of metallic colors so that in my imagination the tare wearing metallic or brightly colored clothes.
after that the changed the principal actor, the one that replaced him was very bad, that made us really angry.
i guess the twill wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because the want to change.
it seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because students always make some mistakes while the tare practicing with their partner, in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times.
as the know about your interests and personality, it is easy to help you.
thet can relax, reduce their stress and the tare happy when the find the thing which the wanted.
thet are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because the cannot stop themselves unless the have not got money to spend.
most of the time the have journalists following them everywhere, looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper, and i don't think this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because the tare popular.
i think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if the tare pushing you), to understand what the like and what the don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
on the other hand, some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so the prefer to wear nothing.
most of the time the have journalists following them everywhere, looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper, and i don't think this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because the tare popular.
and the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and the tare all strangers here.
first, i got there at 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and i needed some time to buy the tickets. i bought two tickets for £20 and when i asked for a discount, the didn't give me one, then i was kept waiting for the show to start until 8:15 pm.
can you guess who the chose for the job, "me", yes, me, i couldn't believe it.
and, finally, right before the start the announced that Danny brook would not be in the show that evening.
research has shown that almost every single household owns a pc. some people use them for their job because the need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun.
not only these subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, biology and physical training, but as we study them we understand that the tare not so important as our main subjects.
thet need to be with their family in peace.
if you interested in the clothes as well, but you need to remember, one is male, but one is female, the should have different fashion, at that moment should be had one is boring or have some bad chat, so in the end you both will feel unhappy or angry with each other.
first the talk about the environmental pollution which cars and other vehicles create, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some other problems.
one day when i was there alone, i heard some other kids approaching. i sat down behind one of the stones so the couldn't see me.
jane explained that situation and the understood her.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before, and some women don't earn money. thet have no idea how difficult it is to earn money.
chairs are not only part of the furniture, the tare also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums where the tare art objects.
we said yes immediately. i nearly shouted with happiness when the told us that Luis Miguel was giving the concert. he is my favorite singer.
she was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because the wanted to build a trade center there.
i asked one of the cameramen when the're going to show this show on TV, and he told me the're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel three, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
first, i'll tell you that on the day of the concert i woke up at 6:30 a.m., very early for me. you know me, i'm lazy. the work began around 8:30. it was very hard but then the band came to rehearse. from that moment i enjoyed working until the concert had finished. the atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because the understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team.
thet have a very simple life and behavior when the taren't on the stage.
thet are human beings and the need to keep a little of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that the tare unknown and anonymous and the do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time the want to leave home in order not to be recognized.
about a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, the cooked their food on the fire and the didn't have pens.
in addition to this, you may have some robots bringing the newspaper to the table, tidying up the house, and doing the shopping. maybe the twill also be your life partners.
i am not talking about some kind of achievements in those disciplines but the tare my big passion
thet can relax, reduce their stress and the tare happy when the find the thing which the wanted.
also, that the twill invite a psychologist, the author of the book and maybe the president will talk so i recommend you listen to it.
thet can also talk with British students to communicate study experience.
1) first, the tare located in the center of Rome so the can take a bus to get to them move and around the city.
anyway, in families the usually have this problem that when the buy a new one, suddenly the have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
anyway, we definitely know that the're going to change.
but, i got through it. i had to take care of them during the break, serving drinks, clothes, i even brought them some cigarettes and anything the wanted.
well here in Dublin things are still the same, but i think somebody told you that i went to the Moby concert here at the point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. i guess it was the best concert i've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard? well he told me that the needed people to put everything on the stage, so i went to help them and everything else, and when i got to the point, do you know who was there?
a log cabin would be the ideal accommodation. presumably the tare more spacious than tents and it would be easier to keep tidy.
at the concert the were very successful because the were very confident and i helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic.
at the end of the video, we should find one or two students sit together and ask them a few questions about how the feel about studying at the school? this is the suggestion to making a daily life video in school.
thet become lazy because the know that the can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a button.
well the didn't accept my £20 discount ticket. why?
thet promised me that the would call me someday, which i particularly doubt.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and the develop their own styles which suit them the most.
i helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and the even let me play with their guitars!
thirdly, in your advertisement it said that discounts would be available, but the were not.
it doesn't matter who the tare, where the come from, what color skin the have.
i think the people who enjoy shopping are greedy for materialistic things and the haven't any interests in the spirit (?), in the intellectual life.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because the can afford it and the don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
i always prefer to read books that are unusual in some way, because the give me the opportunity to escape from everyday reality.
shopmania is really unstoppable. i know women who do everything the can to buy only a dress, or even worse, women who buy things the have no use for, for example, snap, sculptures, kitchen tissues, or everything sold by telemarketing that really is useless, but the cannot resist the fact of it "being there."
i went to buy a ticket and as i like to enjoy the show near the stage i bought a £20 ticket but when i asked for a discount the told me, "i am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement. it will be impossible to give you a discount".
so the can be just ordinary people like us.
the best thing to do would be to show the cooking personnel because the tare very nice.
i really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when the go into a shop the want to try on every single item of clothing and the do not realize the time.
thet always did things together, and the were the most popular boys in school. both were very handsome, played football; the were an example for everybody.
and it's always interesting to watch others while the do something like that.
thet will be comfortable clothes because the main point for any kind of clothing is to be comfortable.
those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable, but the take us away from our friends, our families and moreover the lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything that surrounds us and keeps us alive.
when i got to the theater i asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but the were not available.
as well will have the responsibility of looking after my brother when the taren't at home.
first, when i paid my entrance fee the didn't accept my discount ticket, the told me that the ticket was fake, then i entered the theater and i had to wait 45 minutes. the show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15, "this shows a lack of respect".
basically, i helped them liaise with the local police and get some electronic equipment that the needed.
firstly, i would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an international arts festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it said that i would find stars and artists from around the world, when, in fact, the were from only six countries.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something the want to have, the twill do everything the can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes the even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
as for accommodation, i would prefer log cabins, because i believe the tare more comfortable than tents.
poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, are created too. thet have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming their brain and their bodies, and it can also cause death.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between these two i'd prefer to stay in tents because the give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
shopmania is really unstoppable. i know women who do everything the can to buy only a dress, or even worse, women who buy things the have no use for, for example, snap, sculptures, kitchen tissues, or everything sold by telemarketing that really is useless, but the cannot resist the fact of it "being there."
the advertisement said that the would be available but the were not.
suddenly the tall shouted "surprise!".
it is as if the lose their conscience while the tare shopping.
i think that it is very dangerous because the famous people cannot have a private life and consequently the may suffer from depression and sadness, which may lead them to suicide.
to sum up, although i think the ought to abandon their lives partly when the enter the world of fame, the should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if the do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures, because although the tare famous the also have their private life.
the staff in that department were really friendly and helpful and the were also huge, like giants.
thet are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jealous.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when the can buy something new for their cars, motorbikes or computers.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when the decided to move to London, the invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
it may, in many cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and the had to know there is no private life separately connected to it.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something the want to have, the twill do everything the can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes the even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
for the end-of-conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and the twill provide us with live music and catering.
many years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all these things and the had to work a lot.
future students could appreciate coming if the could still do their sport.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if the don't get their pay first.
i can find cold water in the refrigerator but 50 years ago the didn't have the refrigerator, so our life is easier today.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when the decided to move to London, the invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i had put some money aside for that month, thinking about the discount, but when i went to buy them the said that discounts were not available.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something the want to have, the twill do everything the can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes the even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
it doesn't matter who the tare, where the come from, what color skin the have.
it is as if the lose their conscience while the tare shopping.
if somebody wants to be famous of course the must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her.
in a supermarket, shop or department store the have many things.
when the finished singing the last song i was surprised when the called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people.
but technology has not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us things that can make our lives more comfortable, it has also created things that aren't bad, but if the tare in the hands of the wrong people the can destroy the world.
these are my favorite because the have a lot to do with water, but i like them more than surfing.
and what about those kinds of intellectual and progressive people, don't the tall wear the same type of ugly but comfortable shoes?
more and more people buy mobile phones, because the tare very useful, you get a lot of possibilities like: using the internet, buying different goods, booking tickets, controlling your home technic and many others.
some people when the tare tired relax by sleeping, reading a book or watching television, but not me.
thet found him two months later and six months later he was in jail.
i had a discount ticket, but the refused it and i had to pay the full price.
thet believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because the twill be outgoing, amusing, etc.
regarding the accommodation, i would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in and the taren't very cozy.
sometimes the give up, before the get something,
in accordance with what you have told me about the accommodation i would prefer to go and stay in tents, because i think the're unusual and that is not something that you do every day.
it was boring the nothing happened for such a long time on the stage.
we are all customers of the big supermarkets. they have all the we need.
well here in Dublin things are still the same, but i think somebody told you the i went to the Moby concert here at the point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. i guess it was the best concert i've ever been to, but the coolest thing is the, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one the works as a security guard? well he told me the they needed people to put everything on the stage, so i went to help them and everything else, and when i got to the point, do you know who was there?
in addition, the resort has an interesting historical background concerning the architecture and the best facilities and activities the you could have in Mexico, for example, it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico.
weapons and factories are destroying our planet and we need to realize the we have to use technology to improve our lives, while always trying to respect nature.
i am writing this letter to complain about the treatment the we received when we went to the circle theater in order to see the musical show "over the rainbow", whose actors were Anthony keens and Tina truelove.
the advertisement for the musical said the tit was going to be Danny brook. unfortunately there was someone else-an actor who i do not like and if i had known the the was going to be there i would not have gone to see him.
nearly at the end of this letter i have to say the the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price.
the advertisement also says the there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
one of the reasons the i have visited your arts festival was to see a lot of plays. in the future, i hope to be an actress and the's why i want to learn something from the professionals.
when i first heard about over the rainbow i was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when i heard about the extras the the circle theater was offering, it became the best opportunity i ever had to attend a musical of the type, but instead of being the best evening i ever had, it was a total disaster and the's the reason why i am writing to you.
on the other hand, i understand very well the tit is really necessary. i also understand the nobody will do the in my place.
so the's why they have invented the telephone.
i might say the i am really good at swimming and sailing because i have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and i have had a really good training in water sports.
on the development, they also said the there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty-five years old but the twas totally wrong because i paid the full price, which was £20.
so, unfortunately, i must say the last night was one of the worst nights i ever had, and having given the reasons, i expect to be able to count on your sense of responsibility, so, i feel the i must ask for my 20 pounds i spent on the terrible night.
conversely, painting is an activity which i have never tried before, so i have not any skill in drawing but i would like to start doing the now when i have the chance.
we think the we could go there on the 14th of march, in the evening, instead of going shopping.
i went inside to ask about the package but they told me the tit was gone, so, i went to many shops just to get the same answer.
i think the tit will be nice for the end-of-conference party if you invite somebody to sing and give the students the time to enjoy themselves and to dance.
firstly, i should say the i would like to travel in July because the is the month which i could most likely have off from work to go on holiday.
first, i think we should rent bigger halls so the we can make a better sound and give more space for the audience!
when i was a child i never liked to go shopping because my mum spent so much time in the shops the i remember the going shopping with her was a nightmare.
after two hours i thought the tall of this information was written from a foreign point of view and it wasn't the native opinion.
it was clear the pat had to change and show his friends the they could believe in him thoroughly.
i hope the tour friend Richard brown doesn't have any serious illnesses.
in accordance with what you have told me about the accommodation i would prefer to go and stay in tents, because i think they're unusual and the is not something the you do every day.
i am writing to you about my complaints about the musical show at your theater the i watched a week ago, during my stay in London.
naturally we have a lot of interesting things to visit but something the is special is our cathedral.
and the is always what we want.
at the time i was lucky and also, i would like to recommend it to other friends.
i would not really like to be a famous person, because you are not really yourself, and for me the is the most important thing.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i think i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so the i will be able to do my favorite and skillful hobby: sailing.
some people think the being a famous person is a very exciting thing, the tall the time this makes you feel complete and also they think the if you are famous you are special as well.
those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable, but they take us away from our friends, our families and moreover they lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything the surrounds us and keeps us alive.
while i was standing on the beach, suddenly i heard someone call my name and say the i had to go home. thet is right, it was my mum.
after the, your restaurant was closed without reason.
lastly i would like to inform you the i wanted to have dinner at your restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at 11:00 o'clock,
we think the this is a great opportunity and we are all very interested in going because we can see there the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, a lot of different kinds of make-up and some famous hairstylists.
when we saw your leaflet the mentioned "London's newest and best musical show", we were so enthusiastic and curious the we immediately bought the tickets.
thirdly, the advertisement said the discounts were available but the ticket seller said the there was no discount allowing or available.
he explained to me the tit was to control the light.
they are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something the twill make their neighbor jealous.
it all started when pat, Nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his house. most of the class disagreed with the because the pat's house is extremely little, they started to say to him the this house was like a box.
i'd like to organize my trip for July because the is when i have vacations, also because it is summer in the u.s.a. about accommodation at camp i'd prefer a tent, because it's a new experience for me and i'd like to sleep in a tent to have a great time while having a new adventure.
i am writing in order to express my disappointment at the show "over the rainbow", performed 2 weeks ago; first, i read in the advertisement the Danny brook was to act in the show, but the actor the really played was a different one, and this was very disappointing.
thet is forty-five minutes later! it is also advertised the there were discounts available. however, the twas another lie.
eventually i like shopping too and i believe everybody likes shopping, but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after the and the most important thing is make sure you have enough money to survive.
maria talked to pat about the stupid thing the she had done, but pat refused to apologize to her, because she felt it wasn't a mistake and she did it for only one reason: to help maria to get the man the she loved.
thet was fantastic!
this excellent book tells the story of a man of 25 years the has a little boy, his son, the lives in a very bad condition.
another thing the makes you furious is when you see a great shirt in a shop and somebody else takes it away or buys it before you can react.
as you know, i like drawing and painting when i have some free time so the is why i chose to paint the scenery.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt the twill match their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think the you will take the shirt the they want.
overall, people should think about what it would be like if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer the tall people, including famous people, need a private life and would like to have an ordinary life.
i was surprised the the believed me.
thise book is about a man who knows the the will die soon, he knows the the didn't make his dream come true.
i'm writing to you to give my opinion of the great festival you organized last 21 and 22 of November.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat the ton Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover.
i think the everyone should think not just about the positive side of technology but also the negative.
i can travel in July only because i am working in an office and i must ask my boss for a holiday and it's the month he can give me one, so i hope the isn't a problem for you.
in conclusion, i can say the this is not the biggest problem the the world has and-- it is not my problem because i am not famous!
how has modern technology changed my daily life? i think the technology has changed my life and everybody's life in many ways.
i believe the modern technology has positively affected our lives.
you know the i always wanted to help at a concert. to be part of the staff would be wonderful, i thought. and i was right!
i reckon the tit's not an easy read, but as you described your cousin, i think she really will enjoy it, she's so good at literature the tit won't be a problem for her.
the things the really disappointed me were the you said Danny brook and Tina truelove were the actors but they weren't, different actors played and to be honest they made the whole show very bad.
first, there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are the tit can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
i was very hopeful the i was going to have a good time.
i must say though, i would have to travel in July because it's the summer holidays for schools and i would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if the is possible.
the concerts and the dance show were incredible, except for the classical concert the twas in too small a hall.
thet is forty-five minutes later! it is also advertised the there were discounts available. however, the twas another lie.
i was so disappointed about the.
i'm very happy the i won first prize in your competition.
now the the students have gathered together this year to make a video about the best lessons and activities the we have in school, everything possible of course with help of teacher ms. Westbrook.
when we arrived at the theater we realized the there were no discount tickets available as were mentioned in your advertisement so we had to buy the most expensive ones.
there were 963 people at the "Armageddon" the night!
i also think the the log cabin will be much more comfortable than the tent.
after helping to do the and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before Green Day (the group) left, they came up to us and thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands.
so, the next day pat went and told his sister sally the her friends were organizing a surprise party for her birthday.
also, i want to say the the plays and films were excellent, but there weren't enough of them for me.
but i could see the this face was happy and he wasn't telling lies.
at the end i feel very tired and angry, because i have spent the whole morning doing nothing, except for looking at them trying on different clothes, and the's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's really annoying.
every day scientists and technologists discover and produce more and more new things and the is good. it has to be like the, we have to go forward not backward from the point where we are now.
at first i couldn't believe the i was a winner
because of this, we would kindly ask you to change the program so the we could go to this particular event.
also in the advertisement you wrote the discounts were available, but they weren't, and also the people could visit the theater restaurant after the show to eat something or to have a drink.
however, 15% thought the tit was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important.
i would prefer to stay in a tent, because in the way i can feel closer to nature, and i can remember when i was a girl scout.
i can tell you the tit was a wonderful experience.
firstly, you advertised the Danny brook, who is my favorite, is the lead but there was another actor instead of him.
so, after all of the, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice the the restaurant wasn't open.
i noticed the the artists were from only six countries instead the from around the world.
i believe the if somebody wants fame and glory he must be totally clear about the results.
the reason i'm writing this letter to you is the during my stay in London i felt very disappointed about your theater.
another reason is the tit will be more useful for foreign students who want to speak English.
i was surprised the my father didn't watch me but i soon understood the the was ignoring me.
you stated in your advertisement the the would come on stage, but instead of him someone else turned up.
after the they changed the principal actor, the one the replaced him was very bad, the made us really angry.
sarah realized the everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class, when she turned around talking and whispering started.
the things the people wear are changing all the time, everyone tries to be different in public and very different sorts of clothes are being created.
despite the fact the i felt exhausted i must admit the tit was one of the days i will never forget throughout my whole life
i also sold a pamphlet of the concert, CD and t-shirts.
such as a mobile phone the helps me to communicate with anyone in the world, even if i am not at home; i use a stereo if i want to listen to my favorite music; i use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, etc.
i prefer the because i will travel with my wife and she always prefers the kind of accommodation.
also i wanted to tell you the the show was very boring.
the big secret was the Anna was preparing a surprise party for her brother john and she didn't want anyone to know about it.
two days before i read an advertisement for this show, which said the Danny brook was starring.
i've always wanted to taste the freedom the birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumping in my veins, full of adrenaline, to let myself free, to shake from excitement.
i prefer the kind of accommodation because i can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but i can't have it in a tent.
in conclusion, i believe the we have a right to be informed about their lives, providing the journalists respect some important rules.
a veteran fisherman takes his boat and goes fishing to convince himself and other men the the is still able to do it.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe the the first lesson the should be filmed is philosophy.
my boyfriend told me the the wanted to surprise his friend in his class when the time came.
furthermore, the show started at 20:15 while the advertisement said the tit was going to begin at 19:30.
manager, i expect the you have considered my bad experience at your theater, so i'm asking you for my money back, because it was a very bad evening.
for example, imagine the you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate outfit.
plus, it is mentioned in your advertisement the discounts are available. in fact, no discount was given to me, though i am a student and as a student i was entitled to get a discount but i paid £20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show.
and i would like to make sure the the really loved me.
we believe the the program is very good and well organized and we would like to thank you one more time especially for the.
log cabins may be more comfortable. on the other hand i think the i will be able to "survive" in a tent.
however, i feel the tat the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution the has been created and it seems the tit's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
if an activity has stayed with us, mankind, for so long, it must give us some pleasure and maybe the's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price marked on it, the is the greatest of ecstasies.
the problem is the most of the advertisement was misleading.
i believe the i am like the, i belong to the century.
one day, i innocently told pat the i was dating Philip Smythe, the school's hunk and most popular boy.
i am writing this letter to inform you the i have received your letters and i am going on the trip.
i think the shopping can be both enjoyable and unenjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends, which normally is the only appropriate time!
about the gyms, i like them very much. those places have so many machines the you can easily lose weight and develop a wonderful body.
thet was cruel, because i was very hungry after the show.
well here in Dublin things are still the same, but i think somebody told you the i went to the Moby concert here at the point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. i guess it was the best concert i've ever been to, but the coolest thing is the, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one the works as a security guard? well he told me the they needed people to put everything on the stage, so i went to help them and everything else, and when i got to the point, do you know who was there?
in conclusion, besides all the i mentioned, i highly recommend you video the students 'daily life and interview them.
worst of all, at the end of the musical, i went to your theater restaurant, in order to have dinner, because i had left home without eating and so i was hungry at the time.
these days the computer is part of your life, you use it all the time. sometimes you do personal and other times it is just the things you need to do like go to the bank, use transport, go shopping etc. it is a machine the makes life easy and endow you can carry it everywhere. it is amazing the way as the FAS the computer changes, the programs are faster and more useful and practical.
i like to go window shopping the is good to go around the shopping center.
i'm not keen on liars, Mr smith, and i think the you've lied to naive tourists like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the parts and we only had different, pitiful ones.
i noticed the the artists were from only six countries instead the from around the world.
so, the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all the the advertisement promised.
there's no doubt the modern technology has changed our lives, but how?
apart from the, the show started at 20:15, not at 19:30, as it said in the advertisement and the theater restaurant was closed when the show finished.
i hope you appreciate my letter and the you'll try to amend these problems./ sally sense
however, the point the i am trying to make is the you just ruined my holiday.
you are never going to believe what i did last month. i was walking with my sister in oxford circus, when suddenly a man stopped us saying the the was looking for people to help at a concert and they were going to pay us five pounds an hour.
first, i believe the if someone has time to go to the shops has the possibility.
so, if you are looking for a "really splendid science fiction book" i will recommend you to read "a window." and i'm sure the when you finish reading it you will want to read it again, and again...!
the thing is the we have seen an advertisement for the London fashion and leisure show.
and i think the i made the right choice of profession-it is the perfect combination: a very progressive form of modern technology, and the most important thing-it is extremely interesting to me!
the activities the i would like to do are singing, because my friend told me the i'm good at it, and the other activity the i would like to do is climbing because i think it is very exciting although i have never tried climbing, because there are no mountains in my city.
this modern technology gets closer between person to another person, get close between worldwide, so the, this modern technology changed our daily life so different.
the best thing was the i have learned how to take care of their expensive instruments and i have sung my favorite songs with them.
when i first heard about over the rainbow i was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when i heard about the extras the the circle theater was offering, it became the best opportunity i ever had to attend a musical of the type, but instead of being the best evening i ever had, it was a total disaster and the's the reason why i am writing to you.
in the advertisement for the show you said the tone of the stars was going to be Danny brook, and to my surprise there was a different actor, and the really disappointed me.
i think the is going to be more comfortable for me due to the fact the i am very sensitive to changes of temperature and i can't take the risk of catching a cold because, as you know, i'm going to start to work.
i read in your advertisement in Friday's edition of the times the the show should start at 19.30 but the performance started at 20.15.
however, i would add the journalists-being aware of the hard topic-should try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
i accept and i want to inform you the i can travel only in July because i have booked my annual leave for the period.
thank you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition. i also want to congratulate you on your excellent competition, thanks to which i have the opportunity to go to California, a place the i always wanted to go to.
i am very surprised the such a reputable theater like yours has been able to break all the promises the were made in the advertisement.
i would like to inform you the we have seen an advertisement for the "London fashion and leisure show" and we have found it very interesting.
i'm looking forward to learning how to take care of myself in dangerous situations, such as getting lost in a forest, and i think staying in a tent will be very useful for the.
we thought the with the beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
the part the i enjoyed the most was the i felt i was doing something worthwhile for the community and also the i got to meet a lot of people.
for example, a car, which is used by everyone every day, changed my daily life in the sense the i don't need my dad or my mum to go ice-skating or to go to work. i can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of technology, but because i can show the i am responsible.
beside the, i'm allergic, and the causes me problems when i'm close to nature.
wherever you go everyone would love you because of your trousers, which would clean away all the rubbish the is on the road.
on the other hand, there are the ones the tare also respectable but, apart from their relations with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe the the first lesson the should be filmed is philosophy.
it is not too comfortable, but the is not a problem for me. i like this kind of holiday.
i write this letter to tell you about the program the starts tomorrow, about the excellent book i have told you to read.
the activities the i would like to do are singing, because my friend told me the i'm good at it, and the other activity the i would like to do is climbing because i think it is very exciting although i have never tried climbing, because there are no mountains in my city.
after the we have to make sure the we explain about the relationship between teachers and students, showing the times the we have been out together.
how are you? i'm not so well, and the's the reason why i'm writing this letter to you.
but there was a little problem and it was the my parents didn't let me go to discos alone, so i had to go illegally, and i decided i would do it.
last week i attended the musical "over the rainbow", and i am writing in order to complain about things the really disappointed me.
i know it sounds extremely boring and the is exactly what i thought when i was asked to help, but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected.
i am afraid the i couldn't write to you immediately, but last month i enjoyed helping at a pop concert and so i was very busy.
i would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports i have never tried before. thet means i do not have any experience.
there are some of the devices of modern technology the most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
after the "show" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theater restaurant but what a surprise!
i was very nervous because i'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't help it and i started crying-you can imagine, they were so handsome the i couldn't believe it-i tried to calm down because i had to work, and later i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting the the time went very fast-although i was working-and it was like a dream.
in this book Hemingway is trying to tell us, the if we want something, we can get it, it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it.
it is believed the tour lifestyle has been changed by modern technology such as computers and washing machines etc.
i hope the tall the information you need will be provided satisfactorily.
and the difference is the those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
i have just received your letter saying the i have won the competition. i must say i was really surprised and happy to be given the opportunity to join the camp for two weeks.
thet was very disappointing.
i thought the any brook, who is my favorite actor, would perform in the show.
the reasonably-priced package, including tickets and accommodation, well suited my personal situation: comfortable rooms the tare easy to reach and booked tickets can help you if you decide at the last minute.
thet meant i had to read the recipes very carefully.
i'm writing to you to explain the problem the i have had in your theater.
danny brook is one of my favorite actors so i decided to buy a ticket even though i had to cancel my appointment on the day at 18.30 and also notice of price discount impressed me.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is the instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
i told pat the my father and mother were going to separate.
but also there are some notes the you should improve in next year's festival to make it absolutely wonderful.
besides the the most important thing is the these children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got psychological problems and they are useful in society.
i let this pass and i bought it anyway, thinking the tit was possible the this was only a mistake in your advertisement.
about the size of houses, i think the in cities houses will be more and more small because of overpopulation.
also it was said the discounts would be available, but i didn't receive any discount as you were cheating us. i know the you have a big responsibility but if you have told something to people, stick to it.
for special occasions, for example a party, a concert, people will dress very smartly. i think the tit will be dresses, and suits sewed by the well-known tailors.
thise book is about a man who knows the the will die soon, he knows the the didn't make his dream come true.
when you ask to, the sales person often answers the your size is out of stock.
this is something the has troubled many people, especially those who work in the fashion industry.
i am thinking here particularly of the fact the every event and action is widely discussed in the mass-media.
on the development, they also said the there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty-five years old but the twas totally wrong because i paid the full price, which was £20.
you also mention the your show would start at 19.30 but to my knowledge it started at 20:15 and the meant forty-five minutes of waiting.
you know the i'm a little lazy, but the main reason for not writing to you has been the accumulation of exams during this month.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. i knew the the's a very talkative person, but it was necessary because i wanted him to be the main organizer of the birthday party for tens.
i was sure the discounts were available because i had read the they were, but at the ticket office they didn't offer them.
i hope the my opinion can help you to organize for next year a great international arts festival alone to young people.
i prefer the because i will travel with my wife and she always prefers the kind of accommodation.
the advertisement said the they would be available but they were not.
she told everyone the i fancy him and everybody always makes a joke of it. thet makes me feel so embarrassed: i was very angry at the time!
i had to explain to everybody the i actually didn't have a girlfriend. i explained to them the tit was a good possibility, nothing else, but no one believed me, because pat had told them the i had an actual girlfriend.
thet means the there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you, no one to talk to and no one to complain to.
a huge queue the lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out.
therefore, i will suggest the we all Nov to keep the environment clean and healthy for the next generation.
the main advantage is the tit provides you with all the information the you need.
all my family liked the films and the plays the there were very much, but i personally think the tit would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
about the accommodation, i would like you to take careful consideration of the fact the i am asthmatic, so i would appreciate it if you could reserve a bed in a log cabin.
people believe the the bird was sent from heaven.
have you noticed the tall the classic gentlemen wear the same type of suit?
i was promised the the star was Danny Brock but when i was there i saw another star the twas completely different from your brochure.
amazingly, we can find the there are more and more computer users.
i think the people will be as alone and jealous as today.
unfortunately, i was very disappointed to find out the there were no discounts available!
at first i was irritated the contrary to your announcements no discounts were available.
sarah looked at him for a while, then she stood in front of the class and explained to the others the she had won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the coast of southern France and every one of the 19 pupils was invited, except pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
you wrote the your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? i think this is the best choice for him!
in the instance we don't enjoy shopping because we can't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping center.
thet is why i think the modern technology helps me in my daily life.
hello! i am very pleased the i have won the first prize in your competition and i want to tell you the tit would be better for me to go to your camp in July because the month i usually have a rest and now i am thinking about it.
every day scientists and technologists discover and produce more and more new things and the is good. it has to be like the, we have to go forward not backward from the point where we are now.
another thing was the there were no discounts available, and the the restaurant, which i wanted to visit after the show, was closed because of the main cook sickness.
i am writing to thank you for your letter confirming the i won the first prize in your competition.
one of the reasons the i have visited your arts festival was to see a lot of plays. in the future, i hope to be an actress and the's why i want to learn something from the professionals.
it wasn't a "perfect evening out" like you said in the advertisement, so my friends and i would be grateful if you would give us some money back, if the is possible.
the third problem was the tit was written the discounts were available, but when i got there it was not true.
after the we have to make sure the we explain about the relationship between teachers and students, showing the times the we have been out together.
i am writing to give you the information the you asked me for.
thet is very nice the tall costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the u.s.a. and please tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change this activity.
i think it was very clever of me to record the moment which i will never ever forget, and the twas the thing the i liked most about the experience.
the advertisement said the the show would start at 19:30 but it started at 20:15.
i had to keep things in place and check the the microphones were working properly.
secondly, i believe you should know the a lot of people, including me, were not able to enjoy the concerts because some concert halls were too small.
students think the we don't do anything and we don't learn anything special.
in answer to your question, i will have to say the i can only go to the camp in July because of my job; they only gave me the month off.
again we're so sorry the we are causing you inconvenience regarding your plan and thank you for considering us.
anyway, i really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month so the i'd like to write about it!
what i most appreciated was the they gave me their latest CD with their signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, i've given one to you.
finally, we would like to get your permission to go. maybe if it is possible the you can change your program, we can go to your college any time after Tuesday.
i'm pleased to receive your letter and really happy the i won the first prize.
when i was a child i was afraid of all these little insects the live in the ground and this fear still remains now.
in my opinion, in a hundred years we'll wear the same kind of clothes the we wear nowadays.
i had doubts when somebody said the the fashion of the future would be different.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so the when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
but when i hear the word future, i have an image of metallic colors so the in my imagination they are wearing metallic or brightly colored clothes.
then, i was forced to wait forty-five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 instead of 19:30 and, when it finally started, i was really disappointed to see the the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it had said in the advertisement.
in the advertisement you wrote "your perfect evening out", the's very funny.
i cannot imagine living without television, it is something the we need for our education, and for getting news and other helpful information.
it's not the problem the there was no more discount available-but i had chosen it, because i'm (allowed?).
at the time, i took the course which covered all the 4 kinds of strokes.
this book helps us to improve our logic, mind, and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes the can help us very very much.
the real thing was the i had to look after them because without me they would have been lost.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes the i could need and the sort of people the i will find there.
thirdly, in your advertisement it said the discounts would be available, but they were not.
concerning the accommodation-please be informed the i would prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i think the the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities-i have chosen tennis and photography.
despite the fact the i felt exhausted i must admit the tit was one of the days i will never forget throughout my whole life
we could immediately see the tit was broken.
now i can tell you the tit was an amazing challenge for me because i had never done anything like the.
so, the afternoon at lunchtime, i went into the teachers 'room and opened her desk and took the paper out quietly and calmly.
i'd like to say something the i felt during the festival, and give my opinions the would be helpful for you to prepare for the next festival.
after the they changed the principal actor, the one the replaced him was very bad, the made us really angry.
to answer your next question, i would rather stay in a log cabin. the thing is, i have a phobia about insects and my doctor recommended the i should sleep in an enclosed area.
the advertisement says the Danny brook and Tina truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and the twas really disappointing because i was looking forward to them.
it's all right, but i also think the the's exaggerating.
thet show wasn't what it was supposed to be and it is for the treason the i am writing to you.
first, when i paid my entrance fee they didn't accept my discount ticket, they told me the the ticket was fake, then i entered the theater and i had to wait 45 minutes. the show was supposed to start at 19:30 and it started at 20:15, "this shows a lack of respect".
at work my particular job involves two standard pcs with specific software plus one workstation with the Stanford University network (sun) operating system and a special computer the my firm is now developing.
firstly, i must say the i'll be able to have two weeks free only in July, since i have started work and am entitled to have a holiday only in July.
apart from the i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between these two i'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
in the advertisement it was clearly written the Danny brook and Tina truelove would play the main roles.
secondly, i would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because i am allergic to some insects the might get in a tent.
in conclusion most of the time the you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depending on what, why, where and who is the person the you are interested in pleasing.
there is only one bad thing, the this festival was too short.
the machine the twas used for reading this card was very big, you used to need a room for the computer.
i advise finishing with a chemistry lesson so the people see the laboratory.
i'm writing this letter to you to make a complaint about the musical show "over the rainbow" which i saw yesterday. i have to say the i'm very disappointed with what i saw because after seeing your advertisement i expected more. the show was entirely different to what it says in the advertisement.
i am writing in order to complain about the show the your theater put on.
you know, you have to very strongly when you have to do the because when people came in they couldn't wait to get to the front and they try to go through very quickly.
in conclusion, from my point of view, people must learn the despite technology being such a new area to explore, we have to use it with a great deal of responsibility for us all to survive in the future.
so, after all of the, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice the the restaurant wasn't open.
i was very pleased the the main actors listed on the advertisement were Danny brook and Tina truelove.
all of the students-including myself-think of this as a great opportunity the tit would be a pity to miss, especially when students can enter for free.
the aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resort buildings which were built 10 years ago. they are some of the first buildings the were built with the latest technology and designed by an important Mexican architect.
as it is said in the advertisement the show starts at 19.30 but i had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because according to the program it started at 20.15, but the is not the end of the story; in your advertisement it is clearly said the you have discounts available on tickets. thet was not true!
i received your letter and i'm very happy because i didn't expect it, so first i want you to know the i really fancy going to camp California in the u.s.a. for two weeks, especially because i've never been to this country.
this is just a note to confirm for you the i have received your letter.
but soon everyone in the class was looking at me smilingly and i found out the i had many unsuspected friends... not long after, they were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed going shopping, others going to the cinema and a restaurant.
i am writing in order to express my disappointment at the show "over the rainbow", performed 2 weeks ago; first, i read in the advertisement the Danny brook was to act in the show, but the actor the really played was a different one, and this was very disappointing.
in conclusion, i'd like to recommend the you should first know what you have to offer and then advertise it.
if you compare the fashion now with the of 100 years ago, you'll notice the there are incredibly big differences between them.
so i want you to send me some money back for the unpleasant night.
yeah folks, the twas the point i got interrupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but if you want to hear the end of my story than buy the "rossall-school-magazine", next issue, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.
thet Wednesday pat phoned me and told me the sally also loved Paul.
this problem with pat had a lot of consequences, because i had a very heavy discussion with her about it. it was so heavy the tone of our teachers had to calm me down, because i was very angry with her.
i had to explain to everybody the i actually didn't have a girlfriend. i explained to them the tit was a good possibility, nothing else, but no one believed me, because pat had told them the i had an actual girlfriend.
it means the every day except Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for an hour and a half and it means a "double lesson".
i have received your exciting letter, informing me the i have won two weeks at camp California in the USA.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money the i'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
the organizer of the tour spoke with me and asked me if i wanted to do the same work in two months at the Rolling Stones concert isn't the fantastic!
i asked her for help and she promised me she would do everything the she could and keep my secret.
when i received your advertisement concerning the show "over the rainbow" i thought the i'd have a great evening, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me.
i think it was very clever of me to record the moment which i will never ever forget, and the twas the thing the i liked most about the experience.
first, i was surprised the Danny brook and Tina truelove did not perform.
i hope the this will clarify your questions and doubts.
we would like to believe the shopping is the most wonderful part of our life.
i'm quite sure the people all around the world will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people, especially women, who like to be very elegant and beautiful, will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and the's it.
new fabrics create new textures, all kinds of accessories are added to create new versions, to refresh old ideas, to make new proposals the twill last, as always, just a few weeks.
for example, a car, which is used by everyone every day, changed my daily life in the sense the i don't need my dad or my mum to go ice-skating or to go to work. i can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of technology, but because i can show the i am responsible.
her parents have been so upset the they have asked the school to help their child and the is the reason why i'm writing this story.
last but not least, i would like you to know the i think the idea of the weekend ticket for all events was excellent because in the end it was cheaper than paying for each event separately.
we started to put everything on the stage and after this we realized the the band was coming onto the stage near us.
i'm quite sure the people all around the world will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people, especially women, who like to be very elegant and beautiful, will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and the's it.
the answer is the we choose the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundred other people.
when describing the advantages, we should remember the most people like doing shopping.
some people may argue, but i think the politicians and film stars belong to the public.
and the's the story of how i missed the opportunity to go to the only concert the oasis have given in my city.
i tell you in secret the i don't know why she does the.
firstly, i would like to tell you the the idea of organizing an international arts festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it said the i would find stars and artists from around the world, when, in fact, they were from only six countries.
i tell you in secret the i don't know why she does the.
i had always dreamt of being near "the cranberries", but i had never thought the the dream could become reality.
you must have a TV because you can learn about what is happening in the world and you can see some places the you haven't been to.
my opinion is the modern technology can help you to save time.
well on march 11th there was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favorites and as you know i have a cousin the works as an organizer for all the bands the would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew the my favorite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
this activity of shopping has become one of our most important, after all, we go shopping for any reason, we have developed such an instinct for shopping the we can proudly say the we are some sort of kings of the urban jungle.
it is a very cozy building the is on the same avenue as the conference building, approximately one mile away.
at first i was surprised but a few seconds later, when i realized the i wasn't allowed to go, i tried to persuade my teacher to let me go.
not only these subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, biology and physical training, but as we study them we understand the they are not so important as our main subjects.
i am writing to you about an ensure the i had at your last musical at the circle theater.
but i had a big surprise when i saw the tit was a different actor, and i was very disappointed.
but not everything about technology and computers is good, because many people, and me in a control way, have become computers 'and technology's slaves, and we cannot do anything without a machine, and i am not saying the tit's wrong or bad, and i accept the they make our daily tasks easier, but we have to maintain our independence as humans.
i knew the my brother was at home, although i didn't know where he was.
and the best thing is the tit entertains me alone or with people.
in the hope the you understand me.
i appreciate the opportunity the you are giving me and i'm very grateful to you guys.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling the is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine their face clearly.
you cannot imagine our disappointment when we realized the the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and the the restaurant was closed because of repair work; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate a hamburger in a fast-food restaurant.
i've just received your letter, and i must say the i am so surprised. i wasn't expecting to win it.
last week i received your letter in which you told me the i won first prize.
he told me the tit was necessary to do something about it.
as i am specially fond of musicals, i even travel abroad to see what's new, i am probably one of your most devoted customers. i know this word is not the best but you have demonstrated the the theater can be just as cold as any other business.
science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of TV in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to get further information about something the interests you.
so one day she invited me to come to her house at night and to do so i had to run away from our boarding house and the twas illegal.
because of everything i have said i am more likely to think the the benefits of people's inventions are much greater than all their disadvantages.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said the Danny brook would be there, my favorite actor, but there was someone else instead of him.
first i think the in the future we are going to wear fewer clothes because the climate is going to get warmer and warmer.
firstly, i should say the i would like to travel in July because the is the month which i could most likely have off from work to go on holiday.
it all started when pat, Nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his house. most of the class disagreed with the because the pat's house is extremely little, they started to say to him the this house was like a box.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement the there would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe the tit's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
a cabin reminds me too much of my home and is too comfortable. thet isn't what i want to have if i stay in a wild area.
so i worked up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climbed out of the window.
i think it's because the last time i travelled (with my friends), we stayed in log cabins, and when i was sleeping i felt something moving on my skin, then i worked up frightened and when i opened my eyes, i saw lots of big ants!
first, i'll tell you that on the day of the concert i worked up at 6:30 a.m., very early for me. you know me, i'm lazy. the work began around 8:30. it was very hard but then the band came to rehearse. from that moment i enjoyed working until the concert had finished. the atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because they understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team.
last month, i worked as a roadie at a Rolling Stones pop concert. i was responsible for the sound.
i worked until midnight every day.
the place where we worked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days setting up the stage, the equipment, and the lights.
it was rebuilt in 1948 because of the second would war, when it had been damaged.
the computer is our way of communicating with the outside would, whereas with airplanes we can reach our parents and friends easily and much faster than we would if we used boats or trains.
i know i'm a "daughter of this technological would" and unluckily i think i couldn't live without it: it's rather strange that today there's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... but, sometimes i ask myself if the "ancient would", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one.
but the main purpose of the book is to allow you to fly with your imagination and to have a glimpse of how life is going to be in the future, when, perhaps the would will be ruled by machines.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological would which helps them in their education, job and their marriage in the future.
but if it is difficult to forecast the developments of the fashion would, it is nearly impossible to forecast those of the common people, that is a too varied a category.
the history of the human race is the history of would conquest. that said, technology has advanced continuously since the beginning of man's evolution. furthermore, during the last two centuries, there has been an enormous technological explosion. while the xix century gave us the steam engine, factories and the electric light bulb, this century has given us nuclear energy (and sadly atomic weapons), the computer, the internet and television.
a big Buddha was built in 1997 just next to the temple, and it is the largest outdoor Buddha in the would.
we all think the program is organized well. in particular we're so keen on the idea of going to the national art gallery, to see the work of the greatest painters in the would.
however, it was a disappointment when i realized that not many countries were attending the event. i would have liked to have seen more countries from all around the would, for instance, the far east, Indonesia etc.
it contributes to the would's treasure house of literature and arouses an irresistible fascination.
although the would of computers will develop day by day, i lively hope we (human beings) can maintain our way of seeing things.
finally, on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping center and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the would now. it is up to you.
now we know, our would has developed to new would, because we have high technology to do.
first, we usually go to the shops at the same time as the rest of the would and that's a little complicated because the shops are full and it's impossible to try accurately.
i know i'm a "daughter of this technological would" and unluckily i think i couldn't live without it: it's rather strange that today there's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... but, sometimes i ask myself if the "ancient would", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one.
i am really grateful to the people who invented the first motorcycle in the would.
because the would is now a global village people will wear at least one item of traditional or national clothing (for example a peasant jacket or hat), like they do now in rural areas from time to time.
i noticed that the artists were from only six countries instead that from around the would.
science and technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the would, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life.
firstly, the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the would, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased their production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the would, specially the ones who live in third would countries.
such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the would, even if i am not at home; i use a stereo if i want to listen to my favorite music; i use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, etc.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased their production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the would, specially the ones who live in third would countries.
i'm quite sure that people all around the would will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people, especially women, who like to be very elegant and beautiful, will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and that's it.
in this would, where the nations fight to be the best one couldn't be different, the airplane became the most important thing in the war.
in conclusion, i can say that this is not the biggest problem that the would has and-- it is not my problem because i am not famous!
the majority have chosen history, which means a big journey around the would, either at the roman lifestyle, or in the Middle Ages, when a revolution happened with deals and new lands.
another advantage is that, for example, satellite television, which is an example of modern technology, keeps me informed about what is happening in the whole would.
i grew up through the water would and i couldn't live without it.
finally, i would be interested in meeting artists from everywhere in the would not only European artists.
we can invite stars and artists from around the would who will play and presents present all kinds of music like jazz, rock, classical etc.
now we know, our would has developed to new would, because we have high technology to do.
the media moves the would and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so without want i knew that there was going to be a concert in our city given by, from my point of view, the best group in the would, oasis.
if i want to know how a friend is, i just have to phone him; i can see how the would is getting on just by switching on the television, and i can cook in a few minutes using the microwave oven.
so this is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real would of fashion design, because in this show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from make-up artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
they can travel around the would, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be very good people, because "fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this would.
of course, the resources used and the manufacturing will be completely harmless for the environment because people will be more aware of the necessity of taking care of the would we live in.
but i do feel ill at ease when i see disappointed or angry assistants 'faces on leaving the magic would without any souvenirs of it!
firstly, i would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an international arts festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it said that i would find stars and artists from around the would, when, in fact, they were from only six countries.
it's undeniable that during this century our would has been changing.
no matter that people started worried more about pollution in the would.
besides this, the information goes faster than it used to know and it's available at the same time in every part of the would.
you must have a TV because you can learn about what is happening in the would and you can see some places that you haven't been to.
the inventions of the airplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the would, so we can go to the other side of the would in half a day.
the would is packed with so many types of chairs, from the common wooden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others finding a basic range of prices.
so i hope the would reaches agreement about this and computer engineers have to prevent these problems because something good could be something very dangerous.
weapons are designed to kill and defend in a fight. in the second would war so many Germans were killed. also many people died in other regions,
in particular, going to the museum and the art gallery will be a great opportunity for all of us, as they are wourld-famous places in London.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon their lives partly when they enter the would of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
first the conquest of space, then computers, and now the new biotechnologies have changed, and are changing, the face of the would.
they can travel around the would, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be very good people, because "fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this would.
the night he came into this would was one of grater for the inhabitants of the country and also of the town where he was born, it was an ordinary night.
what i really liked doing was helping them with their clothes and make-up, because i learned how to do make-up for someone and i spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the would.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the would, which is exciting for me.
since i have been travelling around the would, i would have imagined being in touch with my family or friends without the internet or my mobile phone.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that there would be stars and artists from around the would. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
but technology has not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us things that can make our lives more comfortable, it has also created things that aren't bad, but if they are in the hands of the wrong people they can destroy the would.
in my opinion the would itself will be different in temperature as a result of global warming, also people will become nicer, less this will take place, so the clothes will mainly be made from cotton with smooth colors like dark green or gray.
with the internet you can communicate with people in different places of the would at the same moment.
although i read that stars and artists came from around the would, i realized that they only came from six countries.
in your advertisement you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the would, unfortunately i found out only six countries were represented.
in accordance with study or work, i use the internet, which is the easiest way to get information from all around the would.
the inventions of the airplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the would, so we can go to the other side of the would in half a day.
look at the history books for 400-600 years ago, or even for the time of the first and second would wars, to see how society has changed, just because we stepped up the advance of science and technology.
computers are little things nowadays, but at the speed at which technology develops, in the next century clothes will tell our doctors about our health at any moment, any time, anywhere, people will be able to locate us around the would.
i had doubts when somebody said that the fashion of the future would be different.
since i have studied photography for several years, i would like to take some pictures of beautiful scenery in California.
i would be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accommodation because i have had all my holidays with my parents in luxury hotels.
your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny brook would play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unknown actor who starred instead of him.
i would prefer swimming because i really like it and i am trying to swim whenever i have got some time, and painting because i have finished a painting course and i have some practice with this.
maybe it would continue reducing in 100 years to come.
when i was 15, i was starting to look for new clothes, shoes, and everything i would find now unnecessary.
you wrote so persuasively that it would be our "perfect evening out"...
however, drawing some beautiful scenery and taking some pictures would be a very good experience for me.
i would prefer to do some climbing because that's what i doing my spare time and i do it quite well.
i would like to travel in July because i have to go back to my country in august.
i would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because i have been told that the Californian summer is hot and dry so, because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a comfortable coolness.
from the activities, i would choose painting-which i am keen on and i have done several courses-and photography-about which i know just the basic skills.
i and my friends would be obliged if you would give us back some of the money we paid.
we paid to see Danny brook, my son's favorite actor, but we were quite disappointed. my son was very happy because he would see his favorite actor for the first time.
in your letter, you asked me whether the book i've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday.
for those next few days, pat would do his best to be as sympathetic as possible.
with this letter i would like to ask you if you would change it because we saw in the London advertiser an advertisement for the London fashion and leisure show.
i would make schools less stressful, with added fun 'cause that way it's easier to learn and i would give students more chances to share their fantasies at school.
we have seen it in an advertisement and i would like to go to the show.
i'm writing to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter, so referring to the question of when i would like to travel, i would like to go anytime during July, because i have to be back home in august, because i need to apply and get everything sorted out, to go to college next September.
i would be very grateful to receive answers to my questions.
i would prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because i have been told that the Californian summer is hot and dry so, because a tent's wind circulation is better, it would create a comfortable coolness.
i would prefer to spend the two weeks in a tent, that's, in my opinion, a way to be nearer the environment and the animals, although i don't mind staying in log cabins.
finally, i would like to ask you whether i have to prepare any special clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me.
i have just finished a professional photography course and i would like to continue my education in this activity.
i would not really like to be a famous person, because you are not really yourself, and for me that is the most important thing.
and well, Mrs Helen, i would really appreciate it if you sent me back a letter with all the answers to my questions.
i want to suggestions for the last day. you and your group could maybe go to green park and visit the queen's house and parliament, this area is very nice and the group would enjoin after the conference to get some fresh air. another option could be the new tell gallery. i have never been there but it could be a good excuse to visit it with you.
you also mention that your show would start at 19.30 but to my knowledge it started at 20:15 and that meant forty-five minutes of waiting.
i was totally unsatisfied with the theater and i would like to have my money back if that's possible.
i would like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so i can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing i need to know is the amount of money that i have to bring with me.
about the accommodation, i would prefer a log cabin instead of a tent, because it is safer and more comfortable.
i would like to travel only in July because i would be on school holidays then and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in winter.
it happened last summer. we planned to go on holiday in the southern part of Thailand by motorbike but we couldn't tell our parents because they wouldn't allow us to go.
firstly, i read in the advertisement that the actor would be Danny brook, and this is one of the reasons why i went to the theater.
concerning the accommodation-please be informed that i would prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i think that the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities-i have chosen tennis and photography.
first, it would be a good thing to say that July would be the best time to travel because it is the hottest month in the year, and the weather will be really nice.
at the camp i would like to choose two activities, painting and singing. i love painting. at university i studied art for two years, but now i don't have much time to paint because i work in a bank and i have a baby.
hello! i am very pleased that i have won the first prize in your competition and i want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your camp in July because that month i usually have a rest and now i am thinking about it.
secondly, i am interested in trying something that i have never done, so i would like to do sailing.
about the accommodation, i would prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because i have a bad back and i think that sleeping in a tent could be not just uncomfortable but also painful for me.
i would like to inform you that central red lion hotel has been booked for the accommodation of the group and it will be quite easy to get everywhere on foot from the hotel during your stay.
and finally, i would have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought i would go to 'theater restaurant'.
i would like the trip to start in July if possible. because this is my holiday start at the camp California, i would like my accommodation in a tent, because i work in the army and on the camp i usually stay in a tent at night, so i will feel more comfortable.
travelling in July, i have to say, would be perfect for me because my birthday is on the 24th of that month and i wish to spend my birthday in the best way possible, so that means there.
about the accommodation, i have no problems, but i would prefer staying in a tent, so that the holiday may be more adventurous.
and finally, i would have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought i would go to 'theater restaurant'.
the activities i would like to do during these two weeks are basketball and swimming.
about accommodation i would prefer a cabin, because i suffer from allergies, and i think a tent would not be very suitable for my health.
also it was said that discounts would be available, but i didn't receive any discount as you were cheating us. i know that you have a big responsibility but if you have told something to people, stick to it.
thirdly, in your advertisement it said that discounts would be available, but they were not.
i would like to write about how it has influenced my daily life.
since i have been travelling around the world, i would have imagined being in touch with my family or friends without the internet or my mobile phone.
regarding the accommodation, i would prefer to stay in tents because i think it will be closer to nature.
second, i would rather stay in a log cabin, because i tend to get very nervous in small closed places, so a tent would be inappropriate for me.
it would be a fun experience!
finally, we would like to know when you will send us the airline tickets and the brochure.
conversely, painting is an activity which i have never tried before, so i have not any skill in drawing but i would like to start doing that now when i have the chance.
finally, i would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come a long way don't have to spend money on accommodation.
in fact there would be only one possibility in July because i will finish my exams at the end of that month and begin vocational training the 1st of august.
in reply to your letter received on the 13th of June, i first would like to say that it is a great pleasure for me to have been chosen.
concerning the accommodation, i would prefer to sleep in a log cabin, because to sleep in a tent would remind me of the bad experience i had in Ireland because of the weather...
i would like to ask you about the weather conditions, so i can decide on what clothes to take, and about costs, so i can make a budget for the holiday.
i would like to inform you that it was a great idea and a valuable activity as a social event.
and i would like to know if it is possible to have our money back.
when we saw your advertisement for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediately decided that this would be a perfect evening out.
but the best thing that we do, when we go shopping is spend time having lunch at a snack bar, watching moves and playing computer games.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
that is because, i do not want to seem fussy, but i like to have some luxuries when i am going on holiday and i think sleeping on the Food without electricity may annoy me.
for those who want something more exciting and adventurous, you are recommended to visit the fun fair and amusement arcade on the top Food of the building.
i would like to ask you for vegetarian Food for me as i am a very strict vegan, and to suggest what kind of clothes to bring.
this is because people won't give up the great taste of Food. although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two.
at all schools the is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also the are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and the are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant the.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, the are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the Calder center, which is a very special bath center.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat the, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find the many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
thre are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because the wasn't any electricity. you should close the theater until the restaurant can be used.
thre are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that the were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
thre were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also the are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and the are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance the was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
english: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time the.
thre are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but the are some others which are also very important for me.
i'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're the.
on video the should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that the can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, the were none.
first, the are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, the was only one hour left to install the different colored lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying the with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so the was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and the were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be the and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, the was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, the were only six nationalities.
with the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. we save the letter and in the weeks we could send it to another person.
i'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the the days that the class will spend in London.
basically, during the hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
in my classroom sorry people stay outside London about 50% in my classroom and everyone is very worried about how they can stay for the days in London.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got the buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about classrooms it very big and comfortable.
then, i was planning to buy the £20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
if i find something special you will be able to visit in the hours i will call you.
those the classes are my choices. i hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for the years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
all the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for the days.
i know i will have the chance to do two activities, so i have chosen two from your list: basketball, because i have been playing it since i was eight and i have been part of a strong team for the years.
we have bought some snacks to eat and the students will sing for him, too.
there wasn't any discount available for the tickets and i went to the theater with my the cousins from Brazil.
the band "the kings" presented a new style of music.
it was exciting looking at all the men working together and building a stage, and it was interesting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configure his computers to get the best sound possible.
coincidentally the show is in London and on tuesday, March 14, which is during the period we are in London for the thready program.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this thready program in London and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.
it took me the months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel the, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
i play the classical guitar and i also sing. i have been playing the classical guitar for the years.
i usually swim the times a week in order to maintain a back treatment which my doctor has recommended me to follow.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least the languages.
finally, on the last day you have the hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping center and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now. it is up to you.
after carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about the hours, i was exhausted.
it's a great opportunity for me to participate in your camp California because normally i work a lot and i can't spend money on travel. moreover, i have to support a big family because i'm married and i have the children.
there is no need to brother about clothes.
i got into the car and gave the jewelry in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
a century ago, when a farmer took the houses out of the stable and put the plow behind them, we've got the word "time".
hourses will only be more modern and more practical but not very different from our homes in the present.
i realized that my bag was outside and i went out to look for it, when a shower of stones covered the entrance of the hold.
the computer was invented 30 years or more ago and started processing information with a big card which was perforated and made a small hold and each hold meant something like a code.
the computer was invented 30 years or more ago and started processing information with a big card which was perforated and made a small hold and each hold meant something like a code.
the memorial hold is surrounded by large playgrounds.
during the afternoon, Tim and i spent the hours before the concert lying in the park next to the sports hold where the concert was to be held.
but the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the "London fashion and leisure show", which will take place in the central exhibition hold, London, on tuesday, March 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. at the same time we have to go to the science museum but we would all like to go to the show.
red-hot chili peppers came here for a short time and they played at the "chemical hall".
-check your wallet and if you have enough money (a very small amount) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like chili, Cuba, Zambia, and morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer low wages for small jobs. you might enjoy your summer holidays and find yourself
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution-i think there will be many such places in a hundred years-and a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
these days, we're surrounded with so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented.
sometimes, there are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
furthermore, it is possible to treat many patients who have serious diseases more effectively, if we use modern technology in medical science.
considering my whole life i can say that modern technology has changed my daily life in many ways.
the festival was excellent in many ways, and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea.
how has modern technology changed my daily life? i think that technology has changed my life and everybody's life in many ways.
it is something very special. its ceiling is made from many small pieces of wood. its windows with many colors. it is fantastic.
i would like to know how many people will stay with me in the tent, and do i have to take with me any special clothes for surfing.
thank you very much for the many interesting positions in this schedule, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which, we are sure, will be very exciting.
i did not have a perfect evening with so many problems.
we saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hats-which until now have been the main point of many fashion creatures.
so if you visit Paris, the Pompadour center is a very interesting building to visit, even if in Paris there are many other buildings.
why have so many people been infected by this "psychological virus"?
after that you have to wait a long time in the queue to pay and many times it isn't possible to pay with your credit card and you don't have any money in cash.
for example, there were some concert halls which were too small to hold so many people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for the audience.
about the gyms, i like them very much. those places have so many machines that you can easily lose weight and develop a wonderful body.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
this is something that has troubled many people, especially those who work in the fashion industry.
we can hardly imagine life without computers, TV sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet none of these things existed seventy years ago.
anyway everybody should do shopping as people need to eat, need clothes and many other important things to live.
there are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
next year, you should calculate or examine how many people will come before you choose a hall, which i feel very good was plays and films.
there are so many monuments in California and so i will remember this holiday with my photographs.
but not everything about technology and computers is good, because many people, and me in a control way, have become computers 'and technology's slaves, and we cannot do anything without a machine, and i am not saying that it's wrong or bad, and i accept that they make our daily tasks easier, but we have to maintain our independence as humans.
the second is nuclear weapons and the many wars in which modern equipment is used.
to summarize, the modern technologies give you and allow you to do many things which would be impossible in the past but also creates many problems.
going shopping is a good thing when you don't know what else to do but it also has many disadvantages.
weapons are designed to kill and defend in a fight. in the second world war so many Germans were killed. also many people died in other regions,
we were thinking is so many other activities to relax and enjoy ourselves then sunbathing on the beach.
although there are new machines etc., medicine makes many discoveries thanks to research into different diseases in order to make the population live longer.
weapons are designed to kill and defend in a fight. in the second world war so many Germans were killed. also many people died in other regions,
i had a very disappointing evening because of many things.
maney different incurable diseases have appeared.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for their cars, motorbikes or computers.
on the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses, but on the other hand they discovered many illnesses which we hadn't heard about before.
what is more, there are many new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipment.
but soon everyone in the class was looking at me smilingly and i found out that i had many unsuspected friends... not long after, they were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed going shopping, others going to the cinema and a restaurant.
and it is responsible for many changes in my life, and i think i wouldn't be able to live without it anymore.
another exciting subject which most of the students like very much is p.e. many students like to play sports.
but where is the bad part of it? well shopping can became horrible at Christmas for example, when hundreds of people go to the shopping center and it also can cause many problems when you become an impulsive buyer.
i went inside to ask about that package but they told me that it was gone, so, i went to many shops just to get the same answer.
on the other hand, playing games and using a computer widens my brain so, as you can see, this modern stuff has got many advantages and disadvantages.
more and more people buy mobile phones, because they are very useful, you get a lot of possibilities like: using the internet, buying different goods, booking tickets, controlling your home technic and many others.
the world is packed with so many types of chairs, from the common wooden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others finding a basic range of prices.
this is not the first time i have been to your theater and i have to tell you i have enjoyed many other plays, but be sure "over the rainbow" will be the last one.
we appreciated the modern technology changed my daily life for help every easy and quickly, we have time to do many things.
there are many things that can go wrong in the process of acquiring a product or service.
it is something very special. its ceiling is made from many small pieces of wood. its windows with many colors. it is fantastic.
this is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing their jobs.
this choice doesn't give many artists the opportunity to express themselves.
there are many ways to earn money, especially in a big city, like the one where we are studying all year around.
despite being used in many ways, it could entertain us as well.
it gives us knowledge useful for many school clubs, like the "marathon shell" club or the robotics club.
first, as i see it the idea of an arts festival is great because in this way many people can get to know artists who come from different countries.
i can spend so many hours because day by day i discover new things.
i'd like to know how much money, and how many clothes we need.
actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! i, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificent events.
modern technology saves us a lot of time and brings us many benefits when we use it in the right way, but some bad way to e.g. send virus to break down network.
you can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert. apart from the musicians and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security... it was so exciting!
it helps me when i study. i can find many things on the internet or write my compositions on it.
lastly, there is a recycling problem, which many people do not care about.
maney years ago, more or less seventy years ago a young man, with an excellent capacity for thinking and inventing things, started building a big thing called a "time machine".
maney years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot.
fourthly, that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy too many things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by yourself.
when i go to bed, because there are many mosquitoes, i turn on a special machine with a battery-like thing in it which kills them.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (i am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choice).
maybe they will be in many colors and they will be very tight.
another point that i want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theater restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
after helping to do that and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before Green Day (the group) left, they came up to us and thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands.
i'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there are many challenges in your new career.
modern technology has changed my life in many different ways:
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution-i think there will be many such places in a hundred years-and a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
i recently had a week's holiday in London, and, during my stay, i went to your theater to see "over the rainbow" because i had seen an advertisement for this show and i was really interested in seeing it for many reasons, one of the reasons is that i love the star, Danny brook.
it may, in many cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life separately connected to it.
to summarize, the modern technologies give you and allow you to do many things which would be impossible in the past but also creates many problems.
this technology has helped in many fields, like medicine, entertainment, work and other things, so it has obviously changed the lives of many people.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the center of the town because there are many places to have a look at and go shopping.
the people who will attend the party include many professors, semi-professors and faculties.
humans have done many things through the years and made many things possible.
however, it was a disappointment when i realized that not many countries were attending the event. i would have liked to have seen more countries from all around the world, for instance, the far east, Indonesia etc.
lastly, i would like to know how many people are coming to the camp i will go to.
also some concert halls were too small for this many people.
nowadays, we have many big shopping centers.
in a supermarket, shop or department store they have many things.
about the TV. i spend many hours in front of the TV. it helps me to relax and spend some hours alone.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
as you offer many activities it was hard to choose which ones i want to do, but i decided to take swimming and photography, because i am very good at swimming and because i am currently attending a photography course in Vienna.
there are so many varieties of products, different prices, different qualities.
the telephone is a very important invention if we can use it correctly without using it as a type of entertainment as many people do nowadays.
this technology has helped in many fields, like medicine, entertainment, work and other things, so it has obviously changed the lives of many people.
although modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living, can it give you nature, peace and fresh air?
for those students who are very interested in shopping, clothes shops, jewelry, stationery, bookshops, fashion and beauty departments and many more are available.
is there only one teacher for each sport, and how many are in each group?
there are also many kinds of take-away restaurants, where i can taste my favorite foods.
because everyone has different thinking like Beverley center if you go there every day or every week for shopping you will get very bored because sometimes there are too many people everywhere, like in the restaurants and shops.
fortunately, there are many ways to earn some money nowadays.
modern technology helps people in many ways and is indispensable.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
humans have done many things through the years and made many things possible.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on make-up and how to have appropriate hairstyles.
nowadays, a simple thing like a computer includes so many possible ways of destroying different environmental compartments.
that's so good when you have the money to enjoy it but, apart from that, there are many problems.
these days we are very interested in space and the millennium and things and many designers have shown millennium looks recently.
besides, i really would like to know approximately how much many i should take with me.
i am very indignant because i wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so i would like you to return my many and take note of all these problems.
after that you have to wait a long time in the queue to pay and many times it isn't possible to pay with your credit card and you don't have any many in cash.
definitely, it was a very disappointing evening and i would appreciate it if it is possible to have my many back.
and please tell me how much many i am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation.
you can imagine how disappointed i felt after that evening, and i am writing to ask you for a refund of part of the many.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of many that i'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
oh i'm getting mad again so i am going to tell you one last thing, it was the most horrible night i had ever had so i demand my many back!
i had put some many aside for that month, thinking about the discount, but when i went to buy them they said that discounts were not available.
when i have enough many the price isn't important, then i can buy a lot of things without considering my many.
and i want to know how much many i have to bring for personal expenses.
and in conclusion i want you to give me my many back, (i still have the advertisement if you want proof of what i say).
we had prepared this quite a long time ago, this trip to the capital and saved a lot of many as well.
often people can't buy a piece of bread. and they ask for many from other people.
of course, you should give a refund for the many spent, not only to me but to all the audience.
for example, how much pocket many will be enough and what kind of clothes i should wear.
also shopping makes people happier by costing a lot of many and it even influences the economic situation more flexibly.
sometimes you can stay out all day just to buy a present for someone. it starts in the morning, and of course you have breakfast somewhere, and it gets later and you are still looking for it, so you have lunch, and finally you spend more many than you thought you would.
since i am going to travel i would like to know how much many it would be advisable to take and what kind of clothing i should take.
i will be glad if you will send my many back.
and because of these circumstances, i would like to have a part of my many back.
is it necessary to bring any many?
for all these reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my many back.
after all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad. i think i can only forgive your theater if you give me a refund of the many i spent there, and some more for all the problems i had.
they are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because they cannot stop themselves unless they have not got many to spend.
pat was my big brother, who had heard of some people paying, "safety-maney", but never know the reason, until he found a large amount of many in my room.
so, because of the things i have mentioned, i think i should be given some many back.
and i want to know more about the many. can you give me more information about the many that i need to bring with me?
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any many over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
the principal reason i'm writing to you at the moment is that i want my many back, because i felt so disappointed with the theater and also with the play.
to cut a long story short, because of everything i have said above, the correct thing for me to do is to ask for my many back, and for you it is just to give it back to me because of all the trouble and disappointment you have made me suffer.
could you please tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses many to spend?
i was totally unsatisfied with the theater and i would like to have my many back if that's possible.
it was not my 'perfect evening out', as your advertisement said it would be, and i would like some many back.
i thought you were a good theater, where people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else, but really i am very disappointed and i want to ask for my many back.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theater that it promises much more than the people can get for their many, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my many back-my bank account number is enclosed.
so i would be grateful if you paid for a full refund of the many i spent on the tickets.
in the end, i asked for i many back (and payment for my horrible night): do you think anybody will give me something back?!
and i would like a refund. you have wasted my evening and many.
finally i would like to ask you if i need any many, because you say all accommodation and travel costs are paid for.
pat was my big brother, who had heard of some people paying, "safety-maney", but never know the reason, until he found a large amount of many in my room.
i thought you understood '; please send many back to me, you know why, don't answer me?
regarding accommodation, i would prefer to have a log cabin. it would be better to leave many or anything in without worrying about theft. i've always dreamed about climbing but i have never had the opportunity to try this sport.
i was very disappointed and i would like to have my many back.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more many than ever before, and some women don't earn many. they have no idea how difficult it is to earn many.
but even without many to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms.
i'm extremely happy because not only do i earn a lot of many but also i'm learning a lot.
first i would like to travel only in July because i am going to work in august to earn many and after that (from September to June) i go to university as usual.
however, shopping sometimes makes them stressed. people often waste many on worthless things.
i would be grateful if you could send me further information about details like how much many or what kind of clothes i'll have to take with me.
well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all these reasons i demand to have my many back, i wasted £20 to see a show which doesn't respect the program i paid for.
these days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centers, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of many.
and now i request my many back.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more many than ever before, and some women don't earn many. they have no idea how difficult it is to earn many.
far from the strength that doing a sport or even going to work requires, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of many.
finally i've got a question: what clothes must i bring with me and how much many?
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of many for their clothes.
so try to imagine my situation. i had paid a lot of many and i didn't see a good show. i am really disappointed.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the many they get from advertisements, reports about their last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
in addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £10. this was excellent. it meant people only spent pocket-maney, and then they could watch all the events on the weekend. for them it is a really economical way to spend their weekend.
to sum up, there is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of many, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
i'd like to know how much many, and how many clothes we need.
it is true, they deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time, however this publicity brings them many, and a comfortable life.
and how much many i should take?
finally i would like to ask you for some further information about the clothes and the many we will need.
nevertheless, i lost my concentration on my studies and i spent the many on entertainment.
because of this, the least you can do for us is to give me my many back and work hard so that this theater, which is famous for its beauty and punctuality doesn't become famous for its disorganized shows.
finally, i would like to ask you whether there is anything i should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra many etc.
with all the dissatisfaction above, therefore, i would like to ask for some of my many back as my evening was not what it should have been.
when all the many had gone from a bank, nobody was there except pat.
a lot of many is involved in research to stop the increase in levels of pollution.
it would be great if you considered returning my many as soon as possible.
some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. you can enjoy your time spending all the many you have, buying clothes, jewelry, furniture, etc.
if you could give me some of my many back that would be a great apology for the waste of time and my disappointment.
-check your wallet and if you have enough many (a very small amount) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Chile, Cuba, Zambia, and morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer low wages for small jobs. you might enjoy your summer holidays and find yourself
i'd like you to send the many to this address: UL tallow 10
i had not any many for travelling and my parents were going to give me some only if i had concrete plans.
we hadn't enough many to buy food or new clothes and the worst was that my youngest brother was terribly ill, and without many we couldn't take him to a doctor.
in my opinion you have to give some many back to me.
definitely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances i really believe you should give me my many back.
i think you realize why i'm writing this letter to ask you to give me my many back.
i look forward to hearing from you in the very near future, to offer me my many back.
i would like to know how much many people usually take and how much clothing.
also there is a big problem: the many.
however, we decided to have the job, because of good many.
however, things which you can get with many do not necessarily fill your dissatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more, your emptiness might be greater.
actually most people work hard to earn their many and consequently, the occasion on which this many is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
when i have enough many the price isn't important, then i can buy a lot of things without considering my many.
this actor was not nearly as brilliant as Danny brook and i would not have paid so much many if i had known this before.
it is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the many over to the hypocritical cashier.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theater that it promises much more than the people can get for their many, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my many back-my bank account number is enclosed.
she spent the many on a magazine.
eventually i like shopping too and i believe everybody likes shopping, but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough many to survive.
for men and women appearance is important and they spend a lot of many buying clothes, cosmetics, accessories, jewelry etc.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more many than ever before, and some women don't earn many. they have no idea how difficult it is to earn many.
definitely, i want my many back as soon as possible.
actually most people work hard to earn their many and consequently, the occasion on which this many is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
that's so good when you have the many to enjoy it but, apart from that, there are many problems.
lastly, can you please tell me how much many would be appropriate to take?
summing up, you might have realized that that wasn't "my perfect evening out" which you promised, so i would like you to give me the many i paid for the ticket back.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much many i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
so i want you to send me some many back for that unpleasant night.
i ask you to transfer many into this account.
if we decide to buy something special and we have enough many for it we have to go and buy it.
by using the interest we can make new pen friends overseas, and create clubs and societies.
also the interest has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
famous people have always been the center of interest for a number of people.
firstly, the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving their knowledge.
i also like surfing. i think it is a dangerous sport, but i know how to do it, because last year a professional surfer thought me.
not only was i a member of the swimming team in our school, but also i had been thought by my father since i was five years old.
as regards painting, i know a lot about it since my grandmother thought me when i was five years old.
i met a lot of different people and they all thought me something new about behavior or compassion.
they thought me specially.
after a few seconds of thought i went straight to pat. "why, why did you do that?"
i thought that any brook, who is my favorite actor, would perform in that show.
and when we understood the internet, we thought that meeting people from other countries and being able "to chat" with them was the height of technology.
as you know, we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country!
i thought i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
i had a five experience as manager too.
i'm not keen on liars, Mr smith, and i think that you've lied to five tourists like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the parts and we only had different, pitiful ones.
if i feel like taking to a friend i just have to call him and wherever he is i will be able to get through to him.
yesterday morning, i went to the toilet. i overheard two people taking about my son. i felt sorry for myself and i burst into tears. i quickly got out of the toilet.
suddenly, an enormous sadness caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definitely break up with me, and i knew i was going to stop taking to pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and i couldn't trust her anymore.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (i am taking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choice).
what a great idea to invite writers! i really liked taking with them.
the thing i really liked was helping the artists and taking to them.
anyway, this is not always necessarily a problem, but it can be a big thing for the famous person, because it gets people taking about him and increases his popularity.
if we are taking about accommodation then accommodation in tents would be great-i love being close to nature.
secondly, my choice is the accommodation in tents. i think it could be more interesting. i could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and taking outside. in my opinion if i choose the log cabin it will be like being at home.
children are not studying as much as they ought to, because they are watching TV, taking on the phone or even playing computer games.
i am not taking about some kind of achievements in those disciplines but they are my big passion
someone is taking, laughing, crying on there, so join them. you will feel much better than you would just by yourself.
sarah realized that everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class, when she turned around taking and whispering started.
of course, the resources used and the manufacturing will be completely harmless for the environment because people will be more aware of the necessity of taking care of the world we live in.
however, drawing some beautiful scenery and taking some pictures would be a very good experience for me.
i am taking photography lessons at university and i started tennis when i was 10 so i am good at both of them.
i want to thank you for preparing such a good program for us and especially for taking us on the river trip to Greenwich.
another point that i want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (19:30) but it started at 20:15, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theater restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
first, in your advertisement for the show you wrote that Danny brook and Tina truelove were taking part in the show.
other workers are taking on other months so there is only July that is available for me.
furthermore, i prefer to do painting and photography as my hobbies and my fascination for art and enjoy taking photographs of wildlife.
i was given the list of activities while i was taking part in the adventure school schemes at the soldier camps in the north of Thailand.
in addition, i would like to choose singing and photography because i am good at singing and taking photographs.
in my opinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taking to Piccadilly line.
it would be wonderful to buy some books or programs with the signatures of all the stars and artists taking part in the festival.
i will consider taking this complaint to court if i do not receive an acceptable explanation from the theater.
this is also another cause of her attacks.
don't miss the chance to visit the historical museum, located in the her of the capital city.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for three years because i know it by her, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
it was badly her. my friend rushed to me, then ran back to my house and called mum.
this made nick very embarrassed and he felt her.
for example, if you were her seriously like cutting your leg off, the new medical technology could rebuild part of your body.
while i will be at the camp i would like sailing, because it is my favorite support.
hopefully i will meet some other girls interested in the same support.
future students could appreciate coming if they could still do their support.
the most popular "support" that everyone does is obviously shopping.
about the activities that i can do at the camp, i chose to play basketball, which is my favorite support, because i want to do some exercise while i am on vacation.
concerning the activities, as a matter of fact tennis is my favorite support and i am very keen on it. for the second activity i would like to enrol in surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient surfer, keeps telling me about the excitement of this support, and i think it is worthwhile trying, therefore i'd love to be in the beginners 'group.
introduction: to support an idea to make a short video about daily life at our school i have spent some time discussing it with other students, and observing and analyzing an average day in our school and have come up with some suggestions.
this was the best part because when everyone was gone, billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginners!!!
i support this idea which is convenient both for the public and the organizers.
what i particularly liked about the experience was the concert was achieved through our support.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. i knew that but i needed someone who could understand and support me at that moment.
it's a great opportunity for me to participate in your camp California because normally i work a lot and i can't spend money on travel. moreover, i have to support a big family because i'm married and i have three children.
there will be a number of developments in technology in the future, which could make our life easier to live but what should remained the same is the feeling of being together and love.
staying in a tent will remained me of an unforgettable time.
for example, if the shop is full of people, it is not enjoyable, because they will create too much confusion, too much nice with the risk of wasting time.
he couldn't believe what pat had told him, so he broke pat's nice.
at all schools there is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, there are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the Calder center, which is a very special bath center.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
thear are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity. you should close the theater until the restaurant can be used.
thear are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
thear were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
english: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there.
thear are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
i'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're there.
on video there should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that there can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, there were none.
first, there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, there was only one hour left to install the different colored lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and sot hear was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to bet hear and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, there was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, there were only six nationalities.
apart from that, the show was delayed forty-five minutes, consequently, everybody there lost control and became angry.
she was sent to New York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a trade center there.
thear are some things i would like to ask about: the type (and quantity) of clothes i will have to take, and if it is necessary to take some money or any additional stuff (like raincoats).
from there to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus, which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town center.
then, i was planning to buy three £20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! i, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificent events.
the activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
you can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert. apart from the musicians and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security... it was so exciting!
thear, Jacob approaches him slowly and tells him.
are there any discotheques or something? i would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her i can't bet hear.
i went to buy a ticket and as i like to enjoy the show near the stage i bought a £20 ticket but when i asked for a discount they told me, "i am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement. it will be impossible to give you a discount".
firstly, this is because there are a lot of scandal magazine readers.
all my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but i personally think that it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
thear is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
could you please let me know where i will eat? if there will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
it's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freely, and there are no teachers. it could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons.
for the accommodation at camp California, i would prefer to have a log cabin because i think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case there is a big storm with heavy rain. a log cabin's more resistant than a tent.
it's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them i like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if i have to make a choice, i choose climbing and surfing.
to make matters worse, we have never had the opportunity to see Danny brook because, instead, there was a different actor!
finally i want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because there aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
i don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so i am rather puzzled about what to wear there.
i don't think that i'd enjoy it, all the people kicking you, you can't walk properly or buy anything. and also there are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops. i mean that some people can fight to get something.
an international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last diet hear were stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
the advertisement also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
you will find there an amazing collection of old weapons, armor and, we are especially proud of it, the great collection of swords.
thear is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only day-off you have to buy something you like.
if you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that there are incredibly big differences between them.
in addition to this, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
first, i got there at 7:00 pm, because the show was about to start at 7:30 pm, and i needed some time to buy the tickets. i bought two tickets for £20 and when i asked for a discount, they didn't give me one, then i was kept waiting for the show to start until 8:15 pm.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would bet hear, my favorite actor, but there was someone else instead of him.
i didn't need to pay an entrance fee because i was working there.
what is more, you advertised there were discounts available but there were not.
thear was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
if Danny brook does not appear, you have to say something about this to the people who are there in the theater. this is your unforgivable mistake.
thear were no discounts available so i overspent.
i stood at the entrance and there i had to check the tickets.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that there would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
and the theater restaurant was being painted, so i could not got hear.
it's not that problem that there was no more discount available-but i had chosen it, because i'm (allowed?).
and the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
it is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot.
also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes there are planned visits to historical places.
thear are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
the task was not easy, at 18 you don't know too much about cryptographic algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it. thear was nothing to lose.
because of it our state can't pay workers in schools, hospitals, on building sites. in our country there is a high number of unemployed.
however, i feel that at the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that has been created and it seems that it's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
i am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while i amt hear. because of my studies, i will take painting, as this is the subject which i am finishing at college, always with important qualifications, and photography which has been my hobby since i discovered that i can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
first, there were no discounts available such as were promised in the advertisement so i had to pay the original price which wasn't cheap at all.
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall center, from different areas of the city.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still i'm happy, that i could bet hear.
thear are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in their private life.
from there you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, which both take you very close to the conference center, and also you can go by underground to get there.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get their pay first.
also it was written in the advertisement that some discounts were available, but there weren't any discounts.
they decided to build more schools, especially in Switzerland because the people there were considered clever.
but when we got into the house there were all my friends!
in fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and i would be grateful if you could give me back a part of my money.
thear were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisement.
but there was a little problem and it was that my parents didn't let me go to discos alone, so i had to go illegally, and i decided i would do it.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the center of the town because there are many places to have a look at and go shopping.
likewise, there were no discounts available.
history: at the castle there are always a few guides, who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle (when it was built, by whom and why), which makes everyone enthusiastic.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and sot hear was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
is there a possibility of exchanging different currencies to us dollars?
at the camp, is there a free uniform or will we have to wear something special?
in the advertisement you say that there is a discount available but there was not.
i prefer that kind of accommodation because i can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but i can't have it in a tent.
if you have never been there, i really recommend you to go.
thear is no need to bother about clothes.
how are you? i'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help there and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
the performances were great, but some halls were too small to accommodate all the people who were there that day.
at the end of the conference there will be a reception at the hotel.
thear are eye-max cinema, museums, a gallery.
i love sports so i would like to play some basketball at the camp. by the way, my team and i won the last school championship. i play guard on my team. i also like tennis but i am not very good. i was wondering if you could give me some lessons while i amt hear.
the advertisement promised there would be my favorite star, Danny brook, but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theater restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
in your advertisement you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately i found out only six countries were represented.
but you can't play if there is too much wind, because the ball becomes uncontrollable!
sometimes, there are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
in my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity: i live on a little mountain at 160 meters altitude so i cannot go to the city using a bicycle. because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and i need a good personal computer with a modem and the internet to study or do research, because there are not any bookshops to buy or borrow books in my little town.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money overt hear without my shopping and how the weather is overt hear in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel three, and you will see met hear playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
actually, i read the advertisement for the show and there were a few mistakes in it.
thear were lasers all over the place, which i had to be careful of.
the advertisement promised there would be my favorite star, Danny brook, but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theater restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
thear is a great opportunity to got hear because students need not pay anything.
because all the smells in the market are awful-thear is the smell of the meat and dirty water, black and smelly water, all over the market street.
the people who were there to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
people won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certainly be synthetic, because there won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would bet hear, my favorite actor, but there was someone else instead of him.
it was also written in the show's advertisement that there would be discounts available on the tickets.
finally you said there was a restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything until we got home.
after all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad. i think i can only forgive your theater if you give me a refund of the money i spent there, and some more for all the problems i had.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether there is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find there.
and now of course there will be someone trying to improve it.
well on march 11th there was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favorites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favorite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
thear has been a change in the relationships between people.
when pat first came into a class or a group of teenagers there were no problems.
thear are huge queues to the tills, noise, hassle, poor customer service.
i had read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there weren't.
i had read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there weren't.
so, after all of that, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice that the restaurant wasn't open.
in Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict.
firstly, you advertised that Danny brook, who is my favorite, is the lead but there was another actor instead of him.
i was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, that was not exactly the case: there were no discounts available, such as were mentioned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; i was then very disappointed to see that Danny brook had been replaced by someone else.
for example there were no discounts available and the theater restaurant was closed after the show, when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance.
to sum up, there is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of money, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
also, i want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but there weren't enough of them for me.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are many kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on make-up and how to have appropriate hairstyles.
and the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
finally i want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
moreover, once i was paying for the tickets, i found another thing out: there were no discounts available.
secondly for us there are disadvantages because pollution affects us indirectly, and because i don't do anything but watch television, and it isn't very good at all.
i think it is very convenient for the group. you know the Victoria area, it is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city. about the hotel, it is clean, and provides a good service. the rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting good value. and the best way to get to the college for the conference is to walk to Victoria station, get the tram to cluster road and after 3 blocks on the left-hand side you will find the college.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
it is easy to get there and free admission.
also there is a very good shopping center next to the museum.
me and my friend were there to hear the sound-check, and when i understood what was happening on the stage, i decided to help them.
thear is a very big library.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have there problems, there affairs, there private lives just as normal people do.
edi redder even talked to me about there programs!
i have friends that are studying in other schools and they are very happy with there freedom.
they are ready to sacrifice all there savings to get something that will make there neighbor jealous.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve there problem all together.
all the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with there difficult tasks.
most young people like carol believe the same and use there minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future.
i particularly liked listening to there musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon there lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect there human rights.
nick and dick could prove there bravery stealing there mother's panties.
the dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of there movements.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it fort hear excursion and because of there interests.
in addition, shop owners often cheat there customers by increasing the cost secretly.
amazingly, doctors tell people to look after there bodies during Christmastime: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.
on the other hand, there life has no privacy.
people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting there mobility.
the historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: there freedom.
people won't be embarrassed to show the beauty of there bodies.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in there education, job and there marriage in the future.
with it people dot hear work more quickly and successfully.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it fort hear excursion and because of there interests.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend there free time more actively-they can often visit there friends and travel much more.
it allowed people to enjoy there weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening there knowledge.
it is as if they lose there conscience while they are shopping.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in there education, job and there marriage in the future.
what i most appreciated was that they gave met hear latest CD with there signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, i've given one to you.
her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help there child and that is the reason why i'm writing this story.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at there tables doing there homework.
firstly, the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving there knowledge.
the time had come. the who groups had combined there forces and were ready to strike.
designers are unique in a way but there designs are sometimes more a piece of art and not for everyday purposes.
poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming there brain and there bodies, and it can also cause death.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from there relations with journalists because of there work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
our whole life is being simplified by machines for not waste the time to work on there development.
it seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because students always make some mistakes while they are practicing with there partner, in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times.
but fort hear considerations, they're working in there routines.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know there preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
they need to be with there family in peace.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend there free time more actively-they can often visit there friends and travel much more.
science and technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved there way of life.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve there work, politicians fort hear campaigns and film stars to make there latest movie famous.
i have got some experience already and i'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore i simply love water sports and there challenges.
why must everybody know and talk about there private life?
men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as there favorite pastime.
they are the main characters of that book, and what characterizes them is the violence of there passions.
what i really liked doing was helping them with there clothes and make-up, because i learned how to do make-up for someone and i spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the world.
now i only need to push a button, and things or machines work on there own.
when choosing this style of life they should realize what there life would be like.
i would make schools less stressful, with added fun 'cause that way it's easier to learn and i would give students more chances to share there fantasies at school.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in there house because there aren't convenient appliances in there houses yet.
some people use them in there work, others wish to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the possibility of movement.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money fort hear clothes.
they could not believe there eyes.
on the other hand, there stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create there own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
i've had the honor of helping there sound engineer and branching the cables for microphones, guitars etc.
in conclusion, i believe that we have a right to be informed about there lives, providing that journalists respect some important rules.
in order to fulfil there readers 'requirements they constantly follow them.
but fort hear considerations, they're working in there routines.
there are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in there private life.
nowadays women wear really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut there hair short just like men.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have there problems, there affairs, there private lives just as normal people do.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in there house because there aren't convenient appliances in there houses yet.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve there work, politicians fort hear campaigns and film stars to make there latest movie famous.
so they prefer to leave there sons watching TV.
first, the actors that the circle theater publicized on there tickets for over the rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
actually most people work hard to earn there money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
thear hobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything.
and the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as there parents and have a happy family.
we can see students expressing there feelings, wonderful and exciting story that the student made up or from a well well-known story.
when the sons were old they began to talk about there life, beginning with this story, which happened a long time ago.
poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming there brain and there bodies, and it can also cause death.
let us try to appreciate there importance again.
after all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got there signatures.
a lot of countries buy guns, fort hear defense they say, but they buy them to kill people.
i mean, it's still unbelievable. can you imagine how like a dream it was to be shaking there hands.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve there work, politicians fort hear campaigns and film stars to make there latest movie famous.
i sometimes lose my desire to buy a thing because of there bad behavior.
only those who get good marks can take part in these activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on there faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
in the last forty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using there car.
what i most appreciated was that they gave met hear latest CD with there signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, i've given one to you.
the best thing was that i have learned how to take care of there expensive instruments and i have sung my favorite songs with them.
nowadays, the majority of people have a computer in there home and sometimes we ask ourselves if modern technology will change our daily life.
the churches and the cathedral are very interesting because of there different romantic styles.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get there pay first.
instead of going to the theater, which is more cultural, or even having a picnic at ikurapiura park, people prefer spending all there money at shopping centers.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at there tables doing there homework.
they can relax, reduce there stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price fort hear clothes.
what is important is not there fashion but there knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
because of everything i have said i am more likely to think that the benefits of people's inventions are much greater than all there disadvantages.
they are ready to sacrifice all there savings to get something that will make there neighbor jealous.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon there lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect there human rights.
since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, there lives have been far easier than before.
it informs people, hospitals use modern technology, and the computer helps standers and helps people dot hear job.
i had a chance to talk to them about there jobs and it was amazing!
this technological improvement is changing people's lives, behavior, event hear homes.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from there relations with journalists because of there work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes there life miserable.
however, i would add that journalists-being aware of that hard topic-should try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have there own private life exposed!
they are human beings and they need to keep a little of privacy and freedom in there lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognized.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new fort hear cars, motorbikes or computers.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about there last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
to sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern there sports activities as well.
research has shown that almost every single household owns a pc. some people use them fort hear job because they need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theater that it promises much more than the people can get fort hear money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back-my bank account number is enclosed.
there is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs fort hear families and friends.
it is very interesting for me how new works, there possibilities.
but even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in there showrooms.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend there leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different from there home.
none of the groups are known at the moment, but i believe they are well on there way to becoming famous bands.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased there production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who live in Third World countries.
it allowed people to enjoy there weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening there knowledge.
on the other hand, there stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create there own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
thear lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funny.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take there pictures, because although they are famous they also have there private life.
in addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £10. this was excellent. it meant people only spent pocket-money, and then they could watch all the events on the weekend. for them it is a really economical way to spend there weekend.
in 100 years, it's possible that everyone will develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, as a way to create there own clothes.
peter and sue asked Francis for some help with there exam subjects and Francis, all week, was too busy to help them.
famous people must understand that the journalists are doing there job.
my main work was to take people to there seats because of a concert hall, which was the millennium dome.
i helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with there guitars!
furthermore, most of the famous brand of sportswear companies will be at this exhibition with there new products for the coming season.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have there problems, there affairs, there private lives just as normal people do.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend there leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different from there home.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match there new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and they develop there own styles which suit them the most.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended there friendship with pat because there popularity was damaged.
future students could appreciate coming if they could still dot hear sport.
boys pierce there bodies just like girls do and vice versa.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse there show. i could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take there pictures, because although they are famous they also have there private life.
what is important is not there fashion but there knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on there levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have there wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
i carried a lot of chairs and looked after the queue or people who lost there way.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine there face clearly.
about a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, they cooked there food on the fire and they didn't have pens.
this is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing there jobs.
in fact, now i can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for example, in the morning and receive there answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing.
nick and dick could prove there bravery stealing there mother's panties.
there are always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed women coming from there offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
i think that the government have to protect them and there private life from the journalists, by punishing journalists.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended there friendship with pat because there popularity was damaged.
by the way, i have already been invited to there next concert.
later, when the show had finished, i stayed with the group in there room for a few minutes.
after helping to do that and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before Green Day (the group) left, they came up to us and thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shore our hands.
then, as we were told that the show was beginning, the second shore of the evening faced us.
my professor said, 'go and get families with your computer, otherwise you'll fail'.
people are used to going to the shopping center because it is easy and families. it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch a movie after that, and, if you want, buy something at the shops.
i'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe become families with our culture.
but you could give me a chance to get more families with it.
she saw some families faces on the other side of the street.
i would prefer to stay in a tent to staying in a cabin. because it is something i feel more families with. i used to go camping with my family every summer.
my families allows me almost everything except smoking and drinking alcohol of course, which i don't do anyway.
that was a disappointment for my whole families. in fact all the audience were very disappointed.
i would like to going July, i don't mind which two weeks, but it has to be that month because in June i am still in school and in august i am going on holiday with my families.
in fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our families and carrying our luggage and shopping bags.
i'm writing this letter because two weeks ago i was in London and i went to the theater to see your musical show. and through seeing it my families had a very disappointing evening and so did i. you can read below my point of view regarding this.
regarding the accommodation, i would be pleased to stay in a tent, because this reminds me of my holidays with my families.
but the situation wasn't simpler, so hill decided to discuss it with Mary, the teacher's cousin.
for that reason clothes will be simpler and more practical.
so this is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in this show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from make-up artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
in fact it wasn't a real house, it was some stones between the trees in the little forest near our house.
actually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell.
-improve your kindness and ask for work in restaurants or bars. it is a good training period for real life too (being patient with demanding people is required).
i am writing to inform you about the differences between your advertisement and the real show.
first, the advertisement i got placed emphasis on Danny brook's starring in the show, but actually, a disappointing, unknown actor played his part, and i wonder whether he had real skills.
the real thing was that i had to look after them because without me they would have been lost.
marine's real father wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to give her back because they loved marine so much.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. that was why our great plan for our holiday was not be real.
another thing is that i took a particular amount of money to buy tickets and when i appeared in front of the ticket desk i found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the real price weren't the same, the real price was much higher.
i would like to experience a real camp again.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine their face clearly.
another thing is that i took a particular amount of money to buy tickets and when i appeared in front of the ticket desk i found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the real price weren't the same, the real price was much higher.
it was a totally new experience for me and a real pleasure working with professionals.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
another thing that is said in the advertisement is that the evening show will start at 7:30 but there was a forty-five minute delay. the crowd got real upset and we were going to leave at the first chance we got.
i real appreciate this kind of trip and i'm real grateful for your attention.
if you real want to discover what Greek history means, we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum!!!
so if you want to have a good, relaxing day shopping, we recommend you don't go with your little brothers and to go with enough time to look around for what you real want.
there was always a lot of security stuff around us to make sure everything was ok, because there real were thousands of people.
about the accommodation during those two weeks, i would rather stay in a log cabin, as it is real difficult for me to stay in a little close room.
if you have never been there, i real recommend you to go.
i don't real worry about the accommodation at camp California, but if i can tell you which one i prefer i'll choose to stay in a tent.
what a great idea to invite writers! i real liked talking with them.
first, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it was delayed until 20.15, and when the show finally began we were surprised to see that Danny brook, who was the star of the show, was not playing and someone else had replaced him and he was real disappointing.
thank you for this prize, i'm real excited and emotional.
i'm pleased to receive your letter and real happy that i won the first prize.
reall i think you have to try to do the same thing next summer, i real enjoyed it.
boy, he's reall handsome!
i am real looking forward to this holiday.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green peace will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
two times a week i have w-f. this is very important, because every soldier should be strong.
there are people from both sides of the argument who have strong feelings.
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution-i think there will be many such places in a hundred years-and a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
the weather had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
it is very nice to stay in tents which are strong and comfortable.
it is amazing and sometimes amusing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cozy little shops is.
i know i will have the chance to do two activities, so i have chosen two from your list: basketball, because i have been playing it since i was eight and i have been part of a strong team for three years.
all the models had very strong long shoes made from black leather, the trousers were quite short and the jackets were elegant with emblazoned material.
also, we expected to get a discount as students, but international students cards are not valid in your theater (that is very strang-even your advertisement has information about discounts).
carol, a 16-year-old girl, said, "i imagine clothes in the future will be very strong.
everybody will wear anything he/ she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wish without this being strong.
strang as it seems, we now have all types of machine or specialized technology to make our daily life more comfortable and less stressful.
i know i'm a "daughter of this technological world" and unluckily i think i couldn't live without it: it's rather strong that today there's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... but, sometimes i ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one.
thirdly, the person on stage was very strong to me, because i expected to see "Danny brook", but i didn't.
i won't ever forget the day the doctor told me and my mum the truth about my strong disease.
they need to be with their family in please.
i felt an enormous pease.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green please will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
that is the most important reason why i only like to go shopping in small stores, where i have please and quiet and very often nothing to complain about.
you can send a letter to your friend by e-mail instead of writing it on a pease of paper and sending it by post.
often people can't buy a pease of bread. and they ask for money from other people.
designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a pease of art and not for everyday purposes.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a pease of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
in fact when i don't feel very happy i decide to go shopping to try to chair myself up.
their hobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything.
after this introduction, it will be time to show some of the activities everyone can do at the school, such as lessons or others like the library, our protagonist having a coffee with some colleagues in the coffee bar, the reception service.
then we can have a rest in the coffee and talk before your flight home.
the first thing i do every day, when i get up, is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffee machine.
after the show i decided to go to have a coffee and to smoke a cigarette to try to calm myself and suddenly i could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the barman's day off.
now i have a new computer, which is very easy to use, and comfortable for my fingers and also faster.
this little easy shows that i depend on technology and, moreover, because i'm in an electronic engineering school, i'm keen on technology.
but pat, coming back home, told her Mather everything.
nowadays, i can't go one day without consulting computer communications via e-mail or the internet. i exchange correspondence with all my family via the internet, with my Mather and 2 brothers who live in Curitiba city and also with a brother who lives in Italy and another who is living in New Zealand.
all this story was a secret but pat revealed it to his Mather.
his Mather always says: "if you are smiling and are nice to people, people will be nice and will smile at you".
when i went to my bedroom i realized that pat had told my Mather about the party, because no one else knew that my Mather did not know that.
first she said to her father, then to her Mather and finally to her brother, that i was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion kilometers from earth and then i was so ashamed because i have been her boyfriend since i came to earth.
anyway, in families they usually have this problem that when they buy a new one, suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between Mather and father or parents and children.
he had problems at home because his Mather wanted to settle down in Australia, but Peter was used to living in New York, where it is overcrowded and he was surrounded by people.
i told pat that my father and Mather were going to separate.
in my early childhood my Mather said to me that when she was a little girl there was only one telephone in the building where she lived.
when i went to my bedroom i realized that pat had told my Mather about the party, because no one else knew that my Mather did not know that.
the Mather was shocked. she didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going in and out the places. it was a nightmare but fortunately the police found her.
in conclusion, no Mather what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do.
i hope this Mather will receive your prompt attention.
no Mather where you are, what you do, apparently, you need electricity.
you cannot imagine our disappointment when we realized that the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of repair work; as a Mather of fact, after the show we only ate a hamburger in a fast-food restaurant.
i hope you will understand this kind of Mather. the class and i are looking forward to hearing from you.
concerning the activities, as a Mather of fact tennis is my favorite sport and i am very keen on it. for the second activity i would like to enrol in surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient surfer, keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and i think it is worthwhile trying, therefore i'd love to be in the beginners 'group.
it doesn't Mather what kind of career or job you have.
it doesn't Mather who they are, where they come from, what color skin they have.
i would like a refund because it was one of the worst evenings of my life. if this Mather is not resolved, i will take it further.
i start thinking about what she or he prefers and i try my best to buy something appropriate no Mather how much money it costs.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't Mather where you are (i am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choice).
no Mather that people started worried more about pollution in the world.
with the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. we save the letter and in their weeks we could send it to another person.
i'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the their days that the class will spend in London.
basically, during their hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
in my classroom sorry people stay outside London about 50% in my classroom and everyone is very worried about how they can stay for their days in London.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got their buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about classrooms it very big and comfortable.
then, i was planning to buy their £20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
if i find something special you will be able to visit in their hours i will call you.
those their classes are my choices. i hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for their years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
all the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for their days.
i know i will have the chance to do two activities, so i have chosen two from your list: basketball, because i have been playing it since i was eight and i have been part of a strong team for their years.
we have bought some snacks to eat and their students will sing for him, too.
there wasn't any discount available for the tickets and i went to the theater with my their cousins from Brazil.
the band "their kings" presented a new style of music.
it was exciting looking at all their men working together and building a stage, and it was interesting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configure his computers to get the best sound possible.
coincidentally the show is in London and on tuesday, March 14, which is during the period we are in London for the Thursday program.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this Thursday program in London and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.
it took me their months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel their, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
i play the classical guitar and i also sing. i have been playing the classical guitar for their years.
i usually swim their times a week in order to maintain a back treatment which my doctor has recommended me to follow.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least their languages.
finally, on the last day you have their hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping center and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now. it is up to you.
after carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about their hours, i was exhausted.
it's a great opportunity for me to participate in your camp California because normally i work a lot and i can't spend money on travel. moreover, i have to support a big family because i'm married and i have their children.
at all schools their is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also their are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and their are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant their.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, their are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the Calder center, which is a very special bath center.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat their, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find their many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
therr are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because their wasn't any electricity. you should close the theater until the restaurant can be used.
therr are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that their were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
therr were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also their are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and their are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance their was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
english: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time their.
therr are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but their are some others which are also very important for me.
i'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're their.
on video their should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that their can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, their were none.
first, their are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, their was only one hour left to install the different colored lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying their with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so their was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and their were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be their and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, their was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, their were only six nationalities.
they can relax, reduce their stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted.
we paid to see Danny brook, my son's favorite actor, but we were quite disappointed. my son was very happy because he would see his favorite actor for the first time.
i'm very happy about this because i spent most of my school life playing sports, especially basketball.
so when the miserable musical came to its end, we were happy to leave the theater auditorium, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theater restaurant, because no restaurants were open anymore, because it started too late.
i received your letter recently, and i am really happy to learn that i have won the first prize.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still i'm happy, that i could be there.
in fact when i don't feel very happy i decide to go shopping to try to cheer myself up.
i received your letter and i'm happy to help you. we booked the palace hotel for your group. it's nice and quiet.
actually, i could have a chance to ask her about music, her favorite artist and her happy.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i think i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favorite and skillful happy: sailing.
the two activities that i prefer are basketball, because i played in my school's team for almost a year, and photography, which is a happy that i am good at and i have done since i was ten.
i have chosen these activities because these days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favorite happy.
it is my only favorite happy.
i am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while i am there. because of my studies, i will take painting, as this is the subject which i am finishing at college, always with important qualifications, and photography which has been my happy since i discovered that i can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
singing is the most favorite happy for us.
and shopping is also a difficult happy to go along with your friends or your partners.
moreover, men prefer to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, which is contrary to the tests of women, because if they have any free time, they will go shopping.
i'd like to have more tests during the whole course, not only at the end, because it's making me very lazy.
with the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. we save the letter and in their weeks we could send it to another person.
i'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the their days that the class will spend in London.
basically, during their hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
in my classroom sorry people stay outside London about 50% in my classroom and everyone is very worried about how they can stay for their days in London.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got their buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about classrooms it very big and comfortable.
then, i was planning to buy their £20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
if i find something special you will be able to visit in their hours i will call you.
those their classes are my choices. i hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for their years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
all the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for their days.
i know i will have the chance to do two activities, so i have chosen two from your list: basketball, because i have been playing it since i was eight and i have been part of a strong team for their years.
we have bought some snacks to eat and their students will sing for him, too.
there wasn't any discount available for the tickets and i went to the theater with my their cousins from Brazil.
the band "their kings" presented a new style of music.
it was exciting looking at all their men working together and building a stage, and it was interesting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configure his computers to get the best sound possible.
coincidentally the show is in London and on tuesday, March 14, which is during the period we are in London for the three-way program.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this three-way program in London and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.
it took me their months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel their, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
i play the classical guitar and i also sing. i have been playing the classical guitar for their years.
i usually swim their times a week in order to maintain a back treatment which my doctor has recommended me to follow.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least their languages.
finally, on the last day you have their hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping center and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now. it is up to you.
after carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about their hours, i was exhausted.
it's a great opportunity for me to participate in your camp California because normally i work a lot and i can't spend money on travel. moreover, i have to support a big family because i'm married and i have their children.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do.
edi redder even talked to me about their programs!
i have friends that are studying in other schools and they are very happy with their freedom.
they are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbor jealous.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
all the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with their difficult tasks.
most young people like carol believe the same and use their minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future.
i particularly liked listening to their musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon their lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
nick and dick could prove their bravery stealing their mother's panties.
the dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of their movements.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for their excursion and because of their interests.
in addition, shop owners often cheat their customers by increasing the cost secretly.
amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmastime: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.
on the other hand, their life has no privacy.
people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting their mobility.
the historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: their freedom.
people won't be embarrassed to show the beauty of their bodies.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in their education, job and their marriage in the future.
with it people do their work more quickly and successfully.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for their excursion and because of their interests.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively-they can often visit their friends and travel much more.
it allowed people to enjoy their weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening their knowledge.
it is as if they lose their conscience while they are shopping.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in their education, job and their marriage in the future.
as we are going to be in London on this date, we think it could be a great opportunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions, make up, etc. and it is free for students.
when were nine years old and were in third great we had a 'house' where we used to play all afternoon.
basically, during three homes in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
i watch about four homes of TV a day. i even eat my meals in front of the TV. we can see people's life in other countries, which is very interesting for me and my friends.
as and advise try to go shopping in the out pick homes, and don't waste your time asking for promotions advertised in the windows of the shop.
from a small village to the town was a very long way because people used a homes and wagon.
if you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and no one had an opportunity to fly to another country for a holiday, people had to walk or go by homes and ship.
for example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a homes but nowadays, we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from.
there are always, at the end of the afternoon, some well-dressed woman coming from their offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before, and some woman don't earn money. they have no idea how difficult it is to earn money.
in the early 90s it was in fashion for woman to wear only skirts.
men tease woman for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as their favorite pastime.
nowadays woman wear really short skirts, short t-shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men.
shopping sounds very enjoyable and is fantastic for woman. you can find a lot of interesting things which were unexpected.
because woman love shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always give your opinion about clothes, music, perfumes...
moreover, men prefer to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, which is contrary to the tastes of woman, because if they have any free time, they will go shopping.
i think it depends if you are a man or a woman and now i have to say i am a woman and i enjoy it.
you are working with your ideal woman, i still can't believe that i spoke with her.
i think it depends if you are a man or a woman and now i have to say i am a woman and i enjoy it.
the woman who sold me a ticket was very rude to me, actually she started swearing at me.
an old woman told me how important the phone was when her only son was abroad studying computers at "Chicago university". she told me that every night she expected a call from her son, because her was the line of the happiness.
you get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruises because of the woman who pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!!
since man became man he has needed to hunt to survive. in ancient times he used spears, bows and arrows, and the woman's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff.
but other people don't think like this. for example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost.
after that, at 2:00 pm, when people arrived, i was at the entrance to take the tickets and, you know, it was incredible because some people stepped all night in front of the stadium to be in the front row.
but after i climbed two steps more, my right foot stepped. i nearly fell, but luckily my hand caught a rock. it was dangerous, but i didn't have any choice. finally i did it.
the time of the evening performance on the ticket was 19.30 and actually it started at 20.15, which first visitors to stay in one place for 45 minutes, a waste of time.
i had tried to think about stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scare me and he first me to buy cocaine using my checks.
then, i was first to wait forty-five minutes to see the show because it started at 20:75 instead of 19:30 and, when it finally started, i was really disappointed to see that the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it had said in the advertisement.
when i first entered the concert hall, i was given a pass for working here.
forst, the actors that the circle theater publicized on their tickets for over the rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
obviously, pat first denied it, but then she accepted that she was wrong, and apologized to maria. after that pat never again talked about anyone without his or her permission.
after the show had finished, i went to the theater restaurant to have something to during and relax but it was closed because the staff was on holiday.
after a long time walking we decided to return and now the weather was so hot we decided to find a place to during something.
also in the advertisement you wrote that discounts were available, but they weren't, and also that people could visit the theater restaurant after the show to eat something or to have a during.
after the show i wanted to during something in your theater restaurant but when i arrived it was closed because the show started too late!
first we had to prepare the stands with food and during and buy something which had been forgotten.
after the show i needed to during something in the theater restaurant as the advertisement conceived, but it was closed.
after that all the singers arrived and i was in charge of greeting them and giving them something to during.
then i thought that i should go to the theater restaurant to have a during or eat something so that i couldn't say that i had wasted my time by coming here.
without any doubt, it is a historical place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history during the passing of the centuries.
the history of the human race is the history of world conquest. that said, technology has advanced continuously since the beginning of man's evolution. furthermore, during the last two centuries, there has been an enormous technological explosion. while the xix century gave us the steam engine, factories and the electric light bulb, this century has given us nuclear energy (and sadly atomic weapons), the computer, the internet and television.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
all this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown, particularly when you realize that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way through the crowds or while you were queuing to pay.
since i am a student i have to follow the vacation program of my school, which means that i would only be able to travel during the month of July.
when one day pat came over to my house, we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fight the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up.
firstly, i was very embarrassed during the concert, but all the staff were very kind to me and tom too.
firstly, the story takes place in South Africa, during the period of apartheid.
i took a driving-thery test last October and i passed it and i will take a practical driving test very soon.
at all schools there is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
they believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because they will be outgoing, amusing, etc.
it is amazing and sometimes amusing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cozy little shops is.
second i got to the theater at 19.20 because in the advertisement it clearly states that the show starts at 19.30, and i got really mad when i looked at my watch and noticed that i had been waiting for 40 (forty) minutes and the show hadn't started yet... i mean it was amusing!
i always had considered myself to be very lucky to be born in the century because of all the amusing human inventions.
with the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. we save the letter and in their weeks we could send it to another person.

at all schools their is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.

the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant their.

theer are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.

theer are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but thee rare some others which are also very important for me.
i'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're their.
on video their should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that their can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, their were none.
first, thee rare quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, their was only one hour left to install the different colored lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying their with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so their was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and their were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that i'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be their and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
