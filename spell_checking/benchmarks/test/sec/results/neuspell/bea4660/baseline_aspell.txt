after a few seconds of thought i went straight to pat. "why, why did you do that?"
i thought that Danny brook, who is my favourite actor, would perform in that show.
and when we understood the internet, we thought that meeting people from other countries and being able "to chat" with them was the height of technology.
as you know, we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country!
i thought i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
i also like surfing. i think it is a dangerous sport, but i know how to do it, because of the fact that last year a professional surfer thought me.
not only was i a member of the swimming team in our school, but also i had been thought by my father since i was five years old.
as regards painting, i know a lot about it since my grandmother thought me when i was five years old.
i met a lot of different people and they all thought me something new about behaviour or compassion.
they thought me specially.
lastly, there is a recycling problem, which many people do not care about.
firstly, the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
I'd seen your advertisement which recommended the play 'over the rainbow' and i liked it very much.
there are the natural materials on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produces more and more synthetic materials, which relay on the production cost.
my main work was to take people to their seats because of a concert hall, which was the millennium dome.
therefore i am thinking of selling my car, which has changed my life over the last 10 years, which has given me a kind of freedom, which has gone with me to all sorts of fantastic places, and changed my life for a new life: without a car.
for example, recently i was shopping at the market, which is located in the centre of our town.
from the list of activities in which i will have a chance to compete i have chosen basketball and swimming.
we live surrounded by inventions which help as through the day.
to summarize, the modern technologies give you and allow you to do many things which would be impossible in the past but also creates many problems.
actually most people work hard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
finally in my opinion i which we would dress more as we did in the past, using natural material. we must think more about the environment and live closer to nature.
i which that my accommodation at camp California it must be in a tent.
i hope you will enjoy the visit and i which you a nice holiday in overdone.
travelling in July, i have to say, would be perfect for me because my birthday is on the 24th of that month and i which to spend my birthday in the best way possible, so that means there.
it was my dream. i which my daddy
i received a paper in which i was told about a play you are putting on and of the advantages i would get if i went to see it. i which that had never happened.
everybody will wear anything he/ she likes, choosing clothes from any century they which without this being strange.
however, there was one person who told me he wasn't happy at all with the phone, because he used to write a lot, especially at Christmas when he wanted to which all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phones him, ending a very old tradition.
some people use them in their work, others which to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the possibility of movement.
on the whole, being rich and famous doesn't always bring happiness, whereas the majority of the population which they were rich and famous.
i which you had been here with me.
the weather had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
about accommodation at camp California, i would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when i am in a tent i feel closer to nature.
we thought that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
July is also good because the weather is warm and i could enjoy the time i will spend in the camp more.
finally, what kind of weather is waiting for us?
i would like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so i can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing i need to know is the amount of money that i have to bring with me.
how is the weather in California?
i wonder if you could tell me about the weather and what kind of clothes i ought to bring with me.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
in japan, i often play golf but as you know Japanese weather conditions are not good enough for enjoying playing golf, but California has good weather, which means sunshine every day, hopefully.
i would like to ask you about the weather conditions, so i can decide on what clothes to take, and about costs, so i can make a budget for the holiday.
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, please can you tell me about the normal weather for this period?
in the future we won't buy clothes according to size or even colour. our clothes will adapt to our bodies, the weather, our fit, all our needs.
'as i have a choice i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions.
i don't know weather it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their money, or weather it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back's bank account number is enclosed.
i would like to ask weather you have competitions or different activities.
in your letter, you asked me weather the book I've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and weather there is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
first of all, the advertisement i got placed emphasis on Danny brook's starring in the show, but actually, a disappointing, unknown actor played his part, and i wonder weather he had real skills.
i don't know weather it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their money, or weather it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back's bank account number is enclosed.
i would like to ask you how much money i need, how the weather is, in order to pack the necessary clothing, and weather i need anything else.
finally, i would like to ask you weather there is anything i should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
from my point of view it depends on us weather shopping will be enjoyable or not.
weather there is a phone, a fax or email so i can be in touch with my family.
it must be our decision weather to stay and eat there, or not.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all weather i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between these two I'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
in addition i need to know weather meals are included or not with the accommodation so that i can decide how much i must have with me.
finally, i would like to ask you weather i have to prepare any special clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me.
could you please tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and weather the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
do you recommend me to take only summer clothes or some whiner clothes as well?
i would like to travel only in July because i would be on school holidays then and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in whiner.
i would like to know if it is necessary for me to bring some money, and if we will have time to visit the city. about the clothes, do i have to bring some whiner clothes?
I'm the whiner of the first prize in your competition and I'm writing to you to give you some information which was requested by you.
i am writing to answer your invitation which i have received as a first prize whiner.
at first i couldn't believe that i was a whiner
i came to London for a short holiday to meet new people and to have a taste of English culture.
there will be clothes for everyone's taste.
this is because people won't give up the great taste of food. although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two.
I've always wanted to taste the freedom that birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumping in my veins, full of adrenaline, to let myself free, to shake from excitement.
there are also many kinds of takeaway restaurants, where i can taste my favourite foods.
i took a driving taste last October and i passed it and i will take a practical driving taste very soon.
i took a driving taste last October and i passed it and i will take a practical driving taste very soon.
i only put the speakers in the right places, or helped the engineers taste the lights.
it took a long time to taste the speakers and the microphones.
there were hundreds of Thai students waiting to take this taste.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (i am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choose).
there are a lot of options and items to make our choose difficult.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choose and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
and i think that i made the right choose of profession's is the perfect combination: a very progressive form of modern technology, and the most important thing's is extremely interesting to me!
but after i climbed two steps more, my right foot slipped. i nearly fell, but luckily my hand caught a rock. it was dangerous, but i didn't have any choose. finally i did it.
it's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them i like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if i have to make a choose, i choose climbing and surfing.
for activities, my first choose is basketball. i have been playing it since i was nine years old.
i think that the best choose for you is to take the 234 bus.
secondly, my choose is the accommodation in tents. i think it could be more interesting. i could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside. in my opinion if i choose the log cabin it will be like being at home.
regarding the choose of tents or log cabins, i think i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favourite and skillful hobby: sailing.
you wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? i think this is the best choose for him!
since i have a choose of accommodation, I'll definitely go for the log cabin, because i can't bear the heat inside a tent.
he wasn't Danny brook, one of the reasons for my choose of coming to see over the rainbow.
my second choose is golf.
my other choose is painting. i have been painting since i was ten years old. i used to go to special classes and i don't mind if you need me to help in the class.
this choose doesn't give many artists the opportunity to express themselves.
the reason for my choose of singing is that i feel embarrassed about my voice, so maybe i could improve it.
it offers a wide choose of courses from cooking, computing, makeup, languages, geography, to culture and civilization.
'as i have a choose i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions.
as regards accommodation, i would choose to stay in tents.
about the accommodation, from the two options, i choose to sleep in a tent, because i think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.
the other one i would choose is basketball because I'm tall and very fast with the ball.
as you already know, i am trying to become a professional photographer, consequently i would choose photography as the first activity and painting as the second.
it would be great if we could choose swimming and golf.
and regarding the activities, i must choose photography and painting because i am not very good at sports and i think i do well at these things.
i am not very good at painting, but i choose it because it is a good opportunity to do it.
the answer is that we choose the same street (usually the most popular) and the same time as six hundred other people.
i really think you should choose this one for her, it does go with her personality.
and my answer to the question about which activities i would like to choose, well i choose swimming, because it is my daily exercise, and surfing.
next year, you should calculate or examine how many people will come before you choose a hall, which i feel very good was plays and films.
secondly, my choice is the accommodation in tents. i think it could be more interesting. i could enjoy my time with other people playing, eating and talking outside. in my opinion if i choose the log cabin it will be like being at home.
it would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could choose what you want to wear by pressing buttons.
with regard to the activities you offer, it is difficult to choose from such a huge variety, but i prefer to do those i know better such as climbing.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for three years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
finally, i must choose travelling there in July because i am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work.
secondly, i would like to choose a tent for accommodation, because i have never spent time in a tent, that's why, i think it is a good opportunity for me.
i don't really worry about the accommodation at camp California, but if i can tell you which one i prefer I'll choose to stay in a tent.
at the camp i would like to choose two activities, painting and singing. i love painting. at university i studied art for two years, but now i don't have much time to paint because i work in a bank and i have a baby.
what i most appreciated was that they Eve me their latest CD with their signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, I've given one to you.
the history of the human race is the history of world conquest. that said, technology has advanced continuously since the beginning of man's evolution. furthermore, during the last two centuries, there has been an enormous technological explosion. while the xix century Eve us the steam engine, factories and the electric light bulb, this century has given us nuclear energy (and sadly atomic weapons), the computer, the internet and television.
i took lots of pictures, asked for autographs and i even Eve them my cell phone number!
they also Eve me a ticket to watch the concert live.
pat Eve me some advice and i decided to have an operation.
i thought i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad Eve me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
for all these reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you Eve me some or all of my money back.
i met all the staff, and Ricky took lots of photographs with me and Eve me an autographed record.
i got into the car and Eve the jewellery in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
the concert was planned for the following Friday, which was the day after my teacher Eve me my marks.
he also Eve me his address and telephone number if i need help from him in the future.
in answer to your question, i will have to say that i can only go to the camp in July because of my job; they only Eve me that month off.
firstly, the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the internet, Eve ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
i Eve information about correct ways to other places like toilets and medical points.
some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously, maybe just a bit too seriously. they Eve themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or members of other gangs, trying to start fights with them.
nearly at the end of this letter i have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it Eve the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price.
i quickly became bored by this hypocritical attention they Eve me.
she was sent to new York to discover how some people from the government Eve money to the merchants because they wanted to build a trade centre there.
your advertisement was excellent and it Eve me a lot of enthusiasm.
thirdly, i have chosen sailing and photography from the list you Eve me because both of them are my favourite hobbies and i have been enjoying sailing and photography for several years so i am quite good at both of them.
can you believe it, it was mob. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he Eve me a shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the mob concert and everything, thank you.
I'd prefer it if you Eve me this information as soon as you can.
as a student, the low priced ticket certainly attracted me a lot and Eve me the opportunity to see and hear wonderful artists.
i am writing to you in order to Eve you some details you asked me for in your letter.
can you please Eve me some recommendations about the clothes i will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget.
before we can Eve our opinions on this statement we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing.
to cut a long story short, because of everything i have said above, the correct thing for me to do is to ask for my money back, and for you it is just to Eve it back to me because of all the trouble and disappointment you have made me suffer.
i want you to Eve me back my money. i hope that in future you will correct all these mistakes.
the aim of this report is to Eve some information about the new Acapulco resort buildings which were built 10 years ago. they are some of the first buildings that were built with the latest technology and designed by an important Mexican architect.
i would be very grateful if you could Eve me some additional information.
with reference to your letter which i received yesterday, i would like to Eve you some details about the international student conference, also the accommodation and activities that are planned during this week.
i and my friends would be obliged if you would Eve us back some of the money we paid.
the first part, the chairman and a few guests will Eve a speech and the second part, the participants will evaluate themselves, and the last part will consist of dinner and drinks.
because of this, the least you can do for us is to Eve me my money back and work hard so that this theatre, which is famous for its beauty and punctuality doesn't become famous for its disorganised shows.
in wars sailors communicate with mobile phones though places to place to get or Eve information about themselves and the enemy.
please, when you receive this letter Eve me a call so we can arrange everything.
i am writing to you to Eve you some required information.
marine's real father wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to Eve her back because they loved marine so much.
in the end, i asked for i money back (and payment for my horrible night): do you think anybody will Eve me something back?!
I'm writing to you to Eve my opinion of that great festival you organised last 21 and 22 of November.
sometimes they Eve up, before they get something,
finally we should Eve some information also about our tourism, business and computer courses.
plus, i got an autograph from a popular singer. I'll Eve you the autograph as a present.
i was enthusiastic about receiving your letter. i will Eve you all the necessary information.
by contrast, in the future, i guess we would rather go back to the ancient time, owing to have natural life style. we will be unwilling to Eve housework away.
i had not any money for travelling and my parents were going to Eve me some only if i had concrete plans.
regarding the accommodation, i would be pleased to stay in a tent, because those reminds me of my holidays with my family.
thank you for giving me those opportunity.
finally, food shops should be added to those festival next year because only plays and films were not attractive enough to get audiences.
those modern technology gets closer between person to another person, get close between worldwide, so that, those modern technology changed our daily life so different.
i would like to thank you once again for those great opportunity.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money that I'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me those information i would be very pleased.
so those is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in those show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from makeup artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
but after those servile work i met Eminem.
your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracies; those show did not start at 19.30 PM but only at 20.15.
furthermore you can play with the computer, and unfortunately those fact especially has changed my life.
I'd like you to send the money to those address: UL Galloway 10
I'm very happy about those because i spent most of my school life playing sports, especially basketball.
i am really looking forward to those holiday.
in conclusion, i can say that those is not the biggest problem that the world has and-- it is not my problem because i am not famous!
i think those topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view, because we can study the subject's reactions before, during and after shopping.
those story happened two years ago.
that is very nice that all costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the US's. and please tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change those activity.
I'm writing those letter to complain about the musical show i saw during my stay in London.
it said in the leaflet that those would be a perfect evening out, while it was not that at all.
now then, how was those advertising, it was completely different. i am really disappointed with your musical. i am asking you for my money back, because i didn't enjoy your musical.
we would like to ask if we could go to those show on the 15th march instead of doing the visit to the science museum.
some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing, that all the time those makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well.
it was great that you organised the arts festival in those city, because people really need those kind of social activity here.
if you have those opportunity one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like those just to get a free pass.
i am very keen on photography so i definitely will choose those as one of my activities at the camp.
in those book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we want something, we can get it, it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it.
in conclusion, the advertisement promised those would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so i would like to ask for my money back.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of those is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
i remember when i had the first lesson at the university and the teacher took us to the computer centre and i saw these machines, all my colleagues and i were laughing was very difficult to imagine how you can work with those kind of computer.
what kind of an organisation do you call those, sir/ madam?
now, it is already possible to send our shopping list by computer, and those option, in the next few years, will become the most common one.
firstly, the environment is polluted because of technology, although those is our fault.
anyway, in families they usually have those problem that when they buy a new one, suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
i do not have words to express how happy i am. i would like to thank you and camp California for those opportunity.
you wrote an advertisement saying that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit those concert, but there were artists from only 6 countries.
i prefer those accommodation because i think it's easier to meet people when you stay in a tent, near them, than when you stay in a log cabin.
the rest of the activities were very interesting for us, we learnt a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people, and all of those without being expensive. i think that the ticket was excellent for us because of its price.
i asked some people in town and those was the best place to choose.
so those is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in those show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from makeup artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
and finally, i would have had my dinner after those disappointing musical and thought i would go to 'theatre restaurant'.
in those letter you ask me for some further information for my convenience for those trip.
finally, i would like to ask you whether there is anything i should bring on those trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
i am really surprised for the information because i won, and i would like to say thank you for everything. those is why i wrote and sent those letter with the information you need i can only travel in July because it is the only time when i can do it before for my work i do not really care what accommodation i will have. i would prefer to come in July i will be available for the moment. i would really appreciate it if you could tell the people who work at camp California i choose the golf and photography because i think i am really interested in those subjects. i am not really really good but i have some experience.
you wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? i think those is the best choice for him!
those is something i will never ever forget.
i think that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it isn't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event, and with those ticket you can visit everything you want.
in those letter you ask me for some further information for my convenience for those trip.
the aim of those report is to describe the biggest building of our town.
i am writing those letter to complain about your advertisement for the musical show "over the rainbow", which is misleading in a number of ways.
i made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha's friends with a note: "do not tell Agatha about those. those is a surprise party for her. please keep the secret!" pat arranged a great DJ and drinks.
we started to put everything on the stage and after those we realized that the band was coming onto the stage near us.
i am very disappointed with those evening and with those disorganised way of dealing with problems so i am asking for my money back.
those is because i intend to take an examination in September.
nowadays, in the year 2000 we still practise those ancient art but in a different way, we don't use weapons for hunting animals in the jungle, we use the remote to hunt TV shows, and we do not collect vegetables any more, we go shopping.
i would be grateful if you could include those show in your programmer.
after all of those we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
people are getting more and more addicted to those, because it helps to make everyday life easier and more comfortable.
most of the time he gets lost, or they start playing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... and when those happens you get in a bad mood and you'll have a bad day shopping.
those was the best part because when everyone was gone, billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginners!!!
the man said it was OK those time and we got in quite easily, we'd made it.
the modern technologies mean i am able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if i buy a reproductive, i can carry those music everywhere.
in those book, heathcliff as a child wasn't a bad character, but the situations he lived through with the earnshaw family, where he grew up, made him rude, aggressive and noisy.
in addition to those, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
secondly, another problem was the starting time. according to your advertisement, the play starts at 19.30 but instead it started at W, those is almost an hour's delay.
those story happened a long time ago.
maybe you think i am exaggerating but recent studies prove that those mania can be really dangerous.
in fact, those activity seems to be very interesting.
when we saw your advertisement for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediately decided that those would be a perfect evening out.
i decided to go to see those show because of its stars, but on the day i saw it, a different actor performed.
in addition to those, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find there.
those book helps us to improve our logic, mind, and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much.
in fact, i expect a full refund plus compensation for the dissatisfaction suffered. i trust you will give immediate attention to those letter and i look forward to receiving a satisfactory response by return of post within a week.
i used those equipment during the concert, but i was so complicated system.
although i cannot explain any more about the thing i felt during the concert in those letter, I'd like to recommend you to help at a pop concert.
those part had to be saved for later because the concert organiser wanted to know the exact number of visitors.
there is only one bad thing, that those festival was too short.
we really appreciate your organising a very nice programmer, which has been organised by you those time.
the musical should have begun at W, but it started at W; those is unacceptable!
i am writing to reply to your letter in which you told me i won first prize in your competition, which is two weeks. i was very happy with those result since i did not think i could win.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding those choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
one of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes. our school is now the best in the country in all ages. we are preset with those. we can show what we Dion order to be the best.
to make those report easier and faster, it was necessary to make a questionnaire which was given out in the school.
i appreciate those shops for lots of products, cheap prices and big spaces.
i am very indignant because i wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so i would like you to return my money and take note of all those problems.
in answer to your question, i wouldn't change anything because i think that those are the minimum rules that a teenager has to have to be responsible in the future.
definitely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under those circumstances i really believe you should give me my money back.
well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all those reasons i demand to have my money back, i wasted £ 20 to see a show which doesn't respect the programmer i paid for.
who got married, who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable change in his complexion, those are questions that most journalists are interested in.
all those years i believed that my father was killed in a car accident.
i was really astonished by all those shopping centres, like Ada, homebase, etc.
and regarding the activities, i must choose photography and painting because i am not very good at sports and i think i do well at those things.
those are only my immature views. if it is considerable for you, i will be very pleased. thank you very much.
if you break one of those rules you could be expelled for a week, a month or for ever.
now, you just need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city, with a car, aeroplanes, shops, all those things without lights.
i might say that i am really good at swimming and sailing because i have been doing those kinds of activities for five years and i have had a really good training in water sports.
i will always say thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the machines which do the washing and the washing's, before this, women spent a long time doing those tasks.
because we are living a computerised life, we'll able to do most things at home or those flat's have those places as well.
i have chosen those activities because those days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favourite hobby.
although, i would have felt better if i had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentioned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, those couldn't possibly be given either!
the long queues, crowded places, high prices, sales, all those things combined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it.
those actors appeared fortifier minutes late according to what is written in your advertisement.
when i was a child i was afraid of all those little insects that live in the ground and this fear still remains now.
because we are living a computerised life, we'll able to do most things at home or those flat's have those places as well.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between those two I'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
i would prefer to travel in July. i have only this time, because my summer holidays are during those days.
all those exhibits are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence on our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it.
all synthetic material will be uncomfortable for those people.
i hope you appreciate my letter and that you'll try to amend those problems./ sally Sven's
closing those facts, when the musical finished i was very, after waiting for the start of the musical and i was disappointed with this version of over the rainbow. everybody went to the restaurant, which was closed without any explanation.
we found the advertisement in a local newspaper and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity, because the show consists of those topics:
those inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared, but not everyone believes it is really so.
it seems to me that all those failures were your fault, because you were responsible for the organisation of the show.
besides that the most important thing is that those children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got psychological problems and they are useful in society.
so i hope the world reaches agreement about this and computer engineers have to prevent those problems because something good could be something very dangerous.
in those galleries there are historical paintings and antique furniture which Chang used.
all those items of equipment are applications of modern science.
so i feel scared when i think about the consequences if some of the viruses or mad people misuse as happens those days with sex or other.
those days we can use a computer, television and some sophisticated equipment, which were unusual once.
for all those reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my money back.
regarding the activities i would like to choose swimming and climbing for my activities at the camp; i usually do those two activities on the army camp. i know how to climb up on ratchet outside and help other people to climb up.
the activities i would like to do during those two weeks are basketball and swimming.
because of all those inconveniences, i ask you for a total refund.
not only those subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, biology and physical training, but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects.
but those days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
i have chosen those activities because those days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favourite hobby.
and because of those circumstances, i would like to have a part of my money back.
in my opinion the hall for the rock concerts was too small. you have to consider booking a bigger one for next year because those kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people.
i don't like thinking of my house or my life without all those facilities.
during those past few decades, or rather in the 20th century, there has been a great deal of development in modern technology.
i remember when i had the first lesson at the university and the teacher took us to the computer centre and i saw those machines, all my colleagues and i were laughing was very difficult to imagine how you can work with this kind of computer.
at those words, Paul suddenly awoke.
and we are practising those things.
those days a lot of countries have been worried about lands that can't have enough space to build houses.
those things are very convenient; on the other hand, there are lots of disadvantages.
those improvements will be involved by the lack of petrol and nonrenewable energy.
maybe it would be a nice idea to analyse those changes and to put limits on technology, because i think that the most important thing is to understand our life and know the ways we can improve it.
technology, are we prepared for those advances?
on Tuesday we have those lessons: English, maths, economics and physics.
lastly, i think that all those changes won't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptly.
but it was unpleasant because of those things.
after all those problems i became disappointed.
i think those reasons are sufficient to ask for my money back.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making those clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green peace will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
many years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all those things and they had to work a lot.
those days the computer is part of your life, you use it all the time. sometimes you do personal and other times it is just the things you need to do like go to the bank, use transport, go shopping etc. it is a machine that makes life easy and endow you can carry it everywhere. it is amazing the way as the fa's the computer changes, the programs are faster and more useful and practical.
all those products of science are with me from the very beginning of my day.
those are some points i want to mention about the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
because of convenience, we can use our time more effectively, but we should not rely on those things too much.
those days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centres, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of money.
they are just like alcoholics and those people go shopping every day because they cannot stop themselves unless they have not got money to spend.
only those who get good marks can take part in those activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
under those circumstances, as your theatre did not fulfil its commitments, i ask you for a full refund and i expect to receive a cheque for £ 15, as soon as possible yours faithfully
you know how good i am at music anyway i was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds. at the beginning i was connecting all those wires into speakers, music system, guitars etc... the bit that i particularly liked about the experience was when i was standing next to the singers and playing a goitre's know how much i love playing guitarist all those video cameras were just filming us.
because of all those things it obviously wasn't the perfect evening as was said in the advertisement.
all those play an important role in our daily life without us ever understanding them.
those days, we're surrounded with so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented.
those days we are very interested in space and the millennium and things and many designers have shown millennium looks recently.
about the information that you need, i must tell you that i will be able to travel only in July because i have got a new job and i can't ask for more than one month of holidays each year and in the other months i will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays in those months.
i want you to give me back my money. i hope that in future you will correct all those mistakes.
you know how good i am at music anyway i was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds. at the beginning i was connecting all those wires into speakers, music system, guitars etc... the bit that i particularly liked about the experience was when i was standing next to the singers and playing a goitre's know how much i love playing guitarist all those video cameras were just filming us.
but we can't stop those technological improvements.
those are my favourite because they have a lot to do with water, but i like them more than surfing.
we can hardly imagine life without computers, TV sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet none of those things existed seventy years ago.
but in spite of all of those disadvantages, i was pursuing my dreams and objectives and in spite of everything i was going to do it.
of course we will also show other activities, such as PE, the lunch break and the theatre workshop.
the students mentioned that it would be very interesting to show the English lesson because some foreign students will probably join our college next year and it is the best way for them to find out about our English course.
and now of course there will be someone trying to improve it.
of course, you can't afford a luxury car and a large apartment unless you're born with a silver spoon in your mouth.
firstly, the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
of course, what was going to be a perfect evening out turned into a very disappointing evening, and i would be very grateful if you could refund me the price of my ticket.
what i most appreciated was that they gave me their latest CD with their signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, I've given one to you.
there i was impressed by how a singer can course such hysteria in teenagers.
i am sorry to course you inconvenience.
but where is the bad part of it? well shopping can became horrible at Christmas for example, when hundreds of people go to the shopping centre and it also can course many problems when you become an impulsive buyer.
poisonous chemical compounds, EEG. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming their brain and their bodies, and it can also course death.
but they don't consider the problems the rumours may course the famous family or couple.
this is also another course of heart attacks.
amazingly, doctors tell people to look after their bodies during Christmas time: shopping can course you a large variety of undesirable pains.
basically, during three House in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
i watch about four House of TV a day. i even eat my meals in front of the TV. we can see people's life in other countries, which is very interesting for me and my friends.
as and advise try to go shopping in the out pick House, and don't waste your time asking for promotions advertised in the windows of the shop.
about the TV. i spend many House in front of the TV. it helps me to relax and spend some House alone.
after this competition there was mathematics, and two House of biology.
especially if you want to buy clothes with your girlfriend or if you are a girl, you have to be ready to spend House trying on clothes.
finally, on the last day you have three House before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now. it is up to you.
i can spend so many House because day by day i discover new things.
about the TV. i spend many House in front of the TV. it helps me to relax and spend some House alone.
after carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three House, i was exhausted.
teachers will take it from you if it rings during school House.
after two House i thought that all of this information was written from a foreign point of view and it wasn't the native opinion.
for the last day, we have arranged a small party in the hotel. then we all set off to go on a sightseeing tour of brolly town centre for about two House before you leave for the airport.
it is a good start to go on a sightseeing bus on Monday morning, because we can see all the famous buildings in a few House.
if i find something special you will be able to visit in three House i will call you.
working long House, doing plenty of activities, going out, going on holidays.
nowadays i spend 2 House in front of the computer every day, shopping or chatting to people.
during the afternoon, Tim and i spent the House before the concert lying in the park next to the sports hall where the concert was to be held.
it was a hard month because my job was very hard. i worked 12 House per day but always with fun people.
about two House before the beginning of the show, we met the band and received tickets to go backstage. that was wonderful, maybe better than the concert itself!
moreover, you must be aware of the fact that the conference is going to last two House, until W pm.
then the show was supposed to start at 19.30 House but it started at W, more than half an hour late.
it is not too far and the opening House suit us.
when one day pat came over to my House, we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fight the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up.
it all started when pat, nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his House. most of the class disagreed with that because the pat's House is extremely little, they started to say to him that his House was like a box.
i was afraid that someone was near my House and wanted to get into my House.
it contributes to the world's treasure House of literature and arouses an irresistible fascination.
first of all we need the telephone in our House because it's important to make a call if you need something or if something happens to your House and nobody is with you.
i want to suggestions for the last day. you and your group could maybe go to green park and visit the queen's House and parliament, this area is very nice and the group would enjoin after the conference to get some fresh air. another option could be the new tell gallery. i have never been there but it could be a good excuse to visit it with you.
the computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get access to huge informational sources through the internet, to do shopping without leaving my House, to do my work more effectively and quickly.
also, the accommodation i would prefer at camp California is the log cabin, because first when i was a little child we stayed in a small House every holiday and i like that.
among them, the mobile telephone, computers, telexes, different appliances for the kitchen, machines which help housekeepers to do any work about the House.
first of all we need the telephone in our House because it's important to make a call if you need something or if something happens to your House and nobody is with you.
so one day she invited me to come to her House at night and to do so i had to run away from our boarding House and that was illegal.
i looked outside and saw two men go into the House in front of mine.
in addition to this you will be able to control all parts of the House by computer such as temperature or vacuum cleaning.
it was badly hurt. my friend rushed to me, then ran back to my House and called mum.
nick told the situation to the class and offered his House for the party, because it was very big, with large gardens and a big swimming pool.
one day i decided to go to the shopping centre which is only 40 metres from our House.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their House because there aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
pat sent a fax to my House with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined.
in conclusion, i strongly believe that the House of the future will be the House of a new awareness. it will be a very positive point for opening up our lives.
in fact it wasn't a real House, it was some stones between the trees in the little forest near our House.
everything that we do now we do with a computer: it helps to look after the House, to perform very difficult operations, because the computer can think much faster than a human.
nowadays, technology is everywhere, all over your House, your school, office or any place you can be in a city.
in conclusion, i strongly believe that the House of the future will be the House of a new awareness. it will be a very positive point for opening up our lives.
at all schools thee is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also thee are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and thee are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant thee.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, thee are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the caldera centre, which is a very special bath centre.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat thee, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find thee many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
thee are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because thee wasn't any electricity. you should close the theatre until the restaurant can be used.
thee are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that thee were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
thee were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also thee are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and thee are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance thee was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
English: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time thee.
thee are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but thee are some others which are also very important for me.
I'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're thee.
on video thee should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that thee can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, thee were none.
first of all, thee are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, thee was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying thee with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so thee was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and thee were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that I'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be thee and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, thee was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, thee were only six nationalities.
apart from that, the show was delayed fortifier minutes, consequently, everybody thee lost control and became angry.
she was sent to new York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a trade centre thee.
thee are some things i would like to ask about: the type (and quantity) of clothes i will have to take, and if it is necessary to take some money or any additional stuff (like raincoats).
from thee to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus, which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town centre.
then, i was planning to buy three £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that thee were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! i, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as thee were so many magnificent events.
the activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (thee must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
you can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert. apart from the musicians and the singers, thee are people who work with lights, who organize the security... it was so exciting!
thee, Jacob approaches him slowly and tells him.
are thee any discotheques or something? i would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her i can't be thee.
i went to buy a ticket and as i like to enjoy the show near the stage i bought a £ 20 ticket but when i asked for a discount they told me, "i am sorry but thee was an error in the advertisement. it will be impossible to give you a discount".
firstly, this is because thee are a lot of scandal magazine readers.
all my family liked the films and the plays that thee were very much, but i personally think that it would be better to add more because thee were only five plays and seven films.
thee is also a gift shop in thee, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
could you please let me know where i will eat? if thee will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
it's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freely, and thee are no teachers. it could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons.
for the accommodation at camp California, i would prefer to have a log cabin because i think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case thee is a big storm with heavy rain. a log cabin's more resistant than a tent.
it's quite difficult for me because thee are 4 of them i like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if i have to make a choice, i choose climbing and surfing.
to make matters worse, we have never had the opportunity to see Danny brook because, instead, thee was a different actor!
finally i want to find out if thee is a supermarket near the campsite and if thee are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because thee aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
i don't know much about the weather down thee, in California, so i am rather puzzled about what to wear thee.
i don't think that I'd enjoy it, all the people kicking you, you can't walk properly or buy anything. and also thee are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops. i mean that some people can fight to get something.
an international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die thee were stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
the advertisement also says that thee are discounts available but this is not true, thee were none.
you will find thee an amazing collection of old weapons, armour and, we are especially proud of it, the great collection of swords.
thee is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only layoff you have to buy something you like.
if you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that thee are incredibly big differences between them.
in addition to this, thee is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
first, i got thee at W pm, because the show was about to start at W pm, and i needed some time to buy the tickets. i bought two tickets for £ 20 and when i asked for a discount, they didn't give me one, then i was kept waiting for the show to start until W pm.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be thee, my favourite actor, but thee was someone else instead of him.
i didn't need to pay an entrance fee because i was working thee.
what is more, you advertised thee were discounts available but thee were not.
thee was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
if Danny brook does not appear, you have to say something about this to the people who are thee in the theatre. this is your unforgivable mistake.
thee were no discounts available so i overspent.
i stood at the entrance and thee i had to check the tickets.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that thee would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but thee were artists from only six countries and in my opinion thee
and the theatre restaurant was being painted, so i could not go thee.
it's not that problem that thee was no more discount available i had chosen it, because I'm (allowed?).
and the best way to get from thee to the conference is by coach, as thee are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
it is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from thee to the conference by foot.
also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes thee are planned visits to historical places.
thee are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
the task was not easy, at 18 you don't know too much about cryptography algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it. thee was nothing to lose.
because of it our state can't pay workers in schools, hospitals, on building sites. in our country thee is a high number of unemployed.
however, i feel that at the moment thee should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that has been created and it seems that it's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
i am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while i am thee. because of my studies, i will take painting, as this is the subject which i am finishing at college, always with important qualifications, and photography which has been my hobby since i discovered that i can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
first of all, thee were no discounts available such as were promised in the advertisement so i had to pay the original price which wasn't cheap at all.
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get thee, like a big supermarket and mall centre, from different areas of the city.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still I'm happy, that i could be thee.
thee are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in their private life.
from thee you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, which both take you very close to the conference centre, and also you can go by underground to get thee.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work thee don't work if they don't get their pay first.
also it was written in the advertisement that some discounts were available, but thee weren't any discounts.
they decided to build more schools, especially in Switzerland because the people thee were considered clever.
but when we got into the house thee were all my friends!
in fact thee were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and i would be grateful if you could give me back a part of my money.
thee were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisement.
but thee was a little problem and it was that my parents didn't let me go to discos alone, so i had to go illegally, and i decided i would do it.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the centre of the town because thee are many places to have a look at and go shopping.
likewise, thee were no discounts available.
history: at the castle thee are always a few guides, who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle (when it was built, by whom and why), which makes everyone enthusiastic.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so thee was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and thee were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that I'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
is thee a possibility of exchanging different currencies to us dollars?
at the camp, is thee a free uniform or will we have to wear something special?
in the advertisement you say that thee is a discount available but thee was not.
i prefer that kind of accommodation because i can have a kitchen or even a bathroom thee, but i can't have it in a tent.
if you have never been thee, i really recommend you to go.
thee is no need to bother about clothes.
how are you? I'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help thee and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
the performances were great, but some halls were too small to accommodate all the people who were thee that day.
at the end of the conference thee will be a reception at the hotel.
thee are Emacs cinema, museums, a gallery.
i love sports so i would like to play some basketball at the camp. by the way, my team and i won the last school championship. i play guard on my team. i also like tennis but i am not very good. i was wondering if you could give me some lessons while i am thee.
the advertisement promised thee would be my favourite star, Danny brook, but thee was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
in your advertisement you mentioned that thee would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately i found out only six countries were represented.
but you can't play if thee is too much wind, because the ball becomes uncontrollable!
sometimes, thee are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
in my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity: i live on a little mountain at 160 metres altitude so i cannot go to the city using a bicycle. because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and i need a good personal computer with a modem and the internet to study or do research, because thee are not any book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over thee without my shopping and how the weather is over thee in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel three, and you will see me thee playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
actually, i read the advertisement for the show and thee were a few mistakes in it.
thee were lasers all over the place, which i had to be careful of.
the advertisement promised thee would be my favourite star, Danny brook, but thee was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
thee is a great opportunity to go thee because students need not pay anything.
because all the smells in the market are awfuller is the smell of the meat and dirty water, black and smelly water, all over the market street.
the people who were thee to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
people won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certainly be synthetic, because thee won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be thee, my favourite actor, but thee was someone else instead of him.
it was also written in the show's advertisement that thee would be discounts available on the tickets.
finally you said thee was a restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything until we got home.
after all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad. i think i can only forgive your theatre if you give me a refund of the money i spent thee, and some more for all the problems i had.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether thee is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find thee.
and now of course thee will be someone trying to improve it.
well on march 11th thee was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favourites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
thee has been a change in the relationships between people.
when pat first came into a class or a group of teenagers thee were no problems.
thee are huge queues to the tills, noise, hassle, poor customer service.
i had read in the advertisement that thee were some discounts available but thee weren't.
i had read in the advertisement that thee were some discounts available but thee weren't.
so, after all of that, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and thee was a notice that the restaurant wasn't open.
in Italy thee aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict.
firstly, you advertised that Danny brook, who is my favourite, is the lead but thee was another actor instead of him.
i was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, that was not exactly the case: thee were no discounts available, such as were mentioned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; i was then very disappointed to see that Danny brook had been replaced by someone else.
for example thee were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance.
to sum up, thee is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of money, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
also, i want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but thee weren't enough of them for me.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because thee are many different kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on makeup and how to have appropriate hairstyles.
and the best way to get from thee to the conference is by coach, as thee are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
finally i want to find out if thee is a supermarket near the campsite and if thee are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
moreover, once i was paying for the tickets, i found another thing out: thee were no discounts available.
secondly for us thee are disadvantages because pollution affects us indirectly, and because i don't do anything but watch television, and it isn't very good at all.
i think it is very convenient for the group. you know the Victoria area, it is easy to travel from thee to the rest of the city. about the hotel, it is clean, and provides a good service. the rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting good value. and the best way to get to the college for the conference is to walk to Victoria station, get the tram to glister road and after 3 blocks on the Lufthansa side you will find the college.
in spite of that fact thee are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
it is easy to get thee and free admission.
also thee is a very good shopping centre next to the museum.
me and my friend were thee to hear the soundcheck, and when i understood what was happening on the stage, i decided to help them.
thee is a very big library.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have thee problems, thee affairs, thee private lives just as normal people do.
edit bedder even talked to me about thee programmers!
i have friends that are studying in other schools and they are very happy with thee freedom.
they are ready to sacrifice all thee savings to get something that will make thee neighbour jealous.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve thee problem all together.
all the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with thee difficult tasks.
most young people like carol believe the same and use thee minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future.
i particularly liked listening to thee musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon thee lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect thee human rights.
nick and dick could prove thee bravery stealing thee mother's panties.
the dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of thee movements.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for thee excursion and because of thee interests.
in addition, shop owners often cheat thee customers by increasing the cost secretly.
amazingly, doctors tell people to look after thee bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.
on the other hand, thee life has no privacy.
people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting thee mobility.
the historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: thee freedom.
people won't be embarrassed to show the beauty of thee bodies.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in thee education, job and thee marriage in future.
with it people do thee work more quickly and successfully.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for thee excursion and because of thee interests.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend thee free time more actively can often visit thee friends and travel much more.
it allowed people to enjoy thee weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening thee knowledge.
it is as if they lose thee conscience while they are shopping.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in thee education, job and thee marriage in future.
what i most appreciated was that they gave me thee latest CD with thee signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, I've given one to you.
her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help thee child and that is the reason why I'm writing this story.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at thee tables doing thee homework.
firstly, the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving thee knowledge.
the time had come. the who groups had combined thee forces and were ready to strike.
designers are unique in a way but thee designs are sometimes more a piece of art and not for everyday purposes.
poisonous chemical compounds, EEG. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming thee brain and thee bodies, and it can also cause death.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from thee relations with journalists because of thee work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
our whole life is being simplified by machines for not waste the time to work on thee development.
it seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because students always make some mistakes while they are practising with thee partner, in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times.
but for thee considerations, they're working in thee routines.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know thee preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
they need to be with thee family in peace.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend thee free time more actively can often visit thee friends and travel much more.
science and technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved thee way of life.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve thee work, politicians for thee campaigns and film stars to make thee latest movie famous.
i have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore i simply love water sports and thee challenges.
why must everybody know and talk about thee private life?
men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as thee favourite pastime.
they are the main characters of that book, and what characterizes them is the violence of thee passions.
what i really liked doing was helping them with thee clothes and makeup, because i learnt how to do makeup for someone and i spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the world.
now i only need to push a button, and things or machines work on thee own.
when choosing this style of life they should realise what thee life would be like.
i would make schools less stressful, with added fun 'cause that way it's easier to learn and i would give students more chances to share thee fantasies at school.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in thee house because there aren't convenient appliances in thee houses yet.
some people use them in thee work, others wish to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the possibility of movement.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for thee clothes.
they could not believe thee eyes.
on the other hand, thee stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create thee own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
I've had the honour of helping thee sound engineer and branching the cables for microphones, guitars etc.
in conclusion, i believe that we have a right to be informed about thee lives, providing that journalists respect some important rules.
in order to fulfil thee readers 'requirements they constantly follow them.
but for thee considerations, they're working in thee routines.
there are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in thee private life.
nowadays women wear really short skirts, short shirts, short tops, and cut thee hair short just like men.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have thee problems, thee affairs, thee private lives just as normal people do.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in thee house because there aren't convenient appliances in thee houses yet.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve thee work, politicians for thee campaigns and film stars to make thee latest movie famous.
so they prefer to leave thee sons watching TV.
first, the actors that the circle theatre publicised on thee tickets for over the rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
actually most people work hard to earn thee money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
thee hobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything.
and the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as thee parents and have a happy family.
we can see students expressing thee feelings, wonderful and exciting story that the student made up or from a well welkin story.
when the sons were old they began to talk about thee life, beginning with this story, which happened a long time ago.
poisonous chemical compounds, EEG. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming thee brain and thee bodies, and it can also cause death.
let us try to appreciate thee importance again.
after all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got thee signatures.
a lot of countries buy guns, for thee defence they say, but they buy them to kill people.
i mean, it's still unbelievable. can you imagine how like a dream it was to be shaking thee hands.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve thee work, politicians for thee campaigns and film stars to make thee latest movie famous.
i sometimes lose my desire to buy a thing because of thee bad behaviour.
only those who get good marks can take part in these activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on thee faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
in the last forty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using thee car.
what i most appreciated was that they gave me thee latest CD with thee signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, I've given one to you.
the best thing was that i have learned how to take care of thee expensive instruments and i have sung my favourite songs with them.
nowadays the majority of people have a computer in thee home and sometimes we ask ourselves if modern technology will change our daily life.
the churches and the cathedral are very interesting because of thee different romantic styles.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get thee pay first.
instead of going to the theatre, which is more cultural, or even having a picnic at Jayapura park, people prefer spending all thee money at shopping centres.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at thee tables doing thee homework.
they can relax, reduce thee stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price for thee clothes.
what is important is not thee fashion but thee knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
because of everything i have said i am more likely to think that the benefits of people's inventions are much greater than all thee disadvantages.
they are ready to sacrifice all thee savings to get something that will make thee neighbour jealous.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon thee lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect thee human rights.
since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, thee lives have been far easier than before.
it informs people, hospitals use modern technology, and the computer helps standers and helps people do thee job.
i had a chance to talk to them about thee jobs and it was amazing!
this technological improvement is changing people's lives, behaviour, even thee homes.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from thee relations with journalists because of thee work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes thee life miserable.
however, i would add that journalist's aware of that hard topical try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have thee own private life exposed!
they are human beings and they need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in thee lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for thee cars, motorbikes or computers.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about thee last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
to sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern thee sports activities as well.
research has shown that almost every single household owns a PC. some people use them for thee job because they need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for thee money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back's bank account number is enclosed.
there is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for thee families and friends.
it is very interesting for me how new works, thee possibilities.
but even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in thee showrooms.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend thee leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than thee home.
none of the groups are known at the moment, but i believe they are well on thee way to becoming famous bands.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased thee production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who live in third world countries.
it allowed people to enjoy thee weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening thee knowledge.
on the other hand, thee stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create thee own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
thee lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funny.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take thee pictures, because although they are famous they also have thee private life.
in addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £ 10. this was excellent. it meant people only spent Pokemon, and then they could watch all the events at the weekend. for them it is a really economical way to spend thee weekend.
in 100 years, it's possible that everyone will develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, as a way to create thee own clothes.
peter and sue asked Francis for some help with thee exam subjects and Francis, all week, was too busy to help them.
famous people must understand that the journalists are doing thee job.
my main work was to take people to thee seats because of a concert hall, which was the millennium dome.
i helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with thee guitars!
furthermore, most of the famous brand of sportswear companies will be at this exhibition with thee new products for the coming season.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have thee problems, thee affairs, thee private lives just as normal people do.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend thee leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than thee home.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match thee new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and they develop thee own styles which suit them the most.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended thee friendship with pat because thee popularity was damaged.
future students could appreciate coming if they could still do thee sport.
boys pierce thee bodies just like girls do and vice versa.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse thee show. i could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take thee pictures, because although they are famous they also have thee private life.
what is important is not thee fashion but thee knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on thee levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have thee wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
i carried a lot of chairs and looked after the queue or people who lost thee way.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine thee face clearly.
about a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, they cooked thee food on the fire and they didn't have pens.
this is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing thee jobs.
in fact, now i can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for example, in the morning and receive thee answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing.
nick and dick could prove thee bravery stealing thee mother's panties.
there are always, at the end of the afternoon, some weltered women coming from thee offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
i think that the government have to protect them and thee private life from the journalists, by punishing journalists.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended thee friendship with pat because thee popularity was damaged.
by the way, i have already been invited to thee next concert.
later, when the show had finished, i stayed with the group in thee room for a few minutes.
although i like camping and sharing with different kinds of people, I'd prefer a comfortable and private place (if it's possible) where i can sleep, or be quieter.. i am not a teenager!
as regards accommodation, i prefer a longer, Canadian tent in a quieter place because i am fond of nature and i would like to feel free in an informal setting.
i received your letter and I'm happy to help you. we booked the palace hotel for your group. it's nice and quieter.
that is the most important reason why i only like to go shopping in small stores, where i have peace and quieter and very often nothing to complain about.
can you imagine how exciting it is when we are in the dark and very quieter and we can hear the sound of the animals.
however, this apparently quieter and relaxed activity can sometimes turn into a living hell; you may only be able to go shopping at the weekend and then, if you do go, you will find yourself in the middle of a huge crowd of people, unable to get to any product or even shop and feeling dizzy with the mixture of smells that come from the people.
I'm quieter good at painting and i play tennis. I'll be very happy if you can give me a chance to use the camp's art studio and you'll be able to prepare some painting materials like oil paints, canvas and brushes for me.
i would prefer to do some climbing because that's what i Dion my spare time and i do it quieter well.
lots and lots of experiments produce quieter interesting and amazing results and i think science is very useful in life.
thirdly, i have chosen sailing and photography from the list you gave me because both of them are my favourite hobbies and i have been enjoying sailing and photography for several years so i am quieter good at both of them.
i have chosen those because i am quieter good at playing basketball and i sing every weekend in the choir of the local church as well.
i was living quieter close to potbelly road but i didn't know the area very well because all the time i just had to get off at the corner of my street. but that day, as i was kind of drunk, i didn't realise that the bus took a different route. so, when i noticed it, the driver was already asking me to get off, because we were in the garage in potbelly.
i also like surfing. i think it is a dangerous sport, but i know how to do it, because of the fact that last year a professional surfer taught me.
I've always enjoyed danger and this time getting the password was, indeed, a taught cookie.
i am very grateful and i want to thank you very Mitch for letting me go on this trip.
someone is talking, laughing, crying on there, so join them. you will feel Mitch better than you would just by yourself.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are Mitch more mobile and can spend their free time more actively can often visit their friends and travel Mitch more.
furthermore, i would like to ask you which kind of clothes i need to take and how Mitch money I'll spend.
and you need a strategy to win the Mitch.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will Mitch their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
colours to Mitch the clothes.
they are more comfortable and really Mitch with the environment.
or, without leaving the office, you are able to heat the weather for a hot bath.
i used to enjoy floating on the weather whenever i was on holiday.
it was difficult for me because i am afraid of weather.
we build big cities, there is hot and cold weather, electricity, gas in practically every home.
i might say that i am really good at swimming and sailing because i have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and i have had a really good training in weather sports.
i have chosen sailing because i would like to try a new sport. i love weather but i have never tried this sport before.
i have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore i simply love weather sports and their challenges.
these are my favourite because they have a lot to do with weather, but i like them more than surfing.
because all the smells in the market are awfuller is the smell of the meat and dirty weather, black and smelly weather, all over the market street.
because all the smells in the market are awfuller is the smell of the meat and dirty weather, black and smelly weather, all over the market street.
i can find cold weather in the refrigerator but 50 years ago they didn't have the refrigerator, so our life is easier today.
however, i hope, there is weather and light inside this log cabin.
i only had to stay behind the drummer supplying them with weather whenever they wanted.
however, i would choose sailing because i am fascinated with the sea and its mysteries and i also like the weather, the wind in my face...
on the other hand, people in the future will probably wear clothes to protect themselves from the polluted air and weather, the harmful ultraviolet rays from the sun and all the dangerous and poisonous gases or chemicals which are the product of a developed and flagon country.
the most important thing was a little boy of about ten years old, who was in the weather without his parents and couldn't swim.
i grew up through the weather world and i couldn't live without it.
the weather had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
about accommodation at camp California, i would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when i am in a tent i feel closer to nature.
we thought that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
July is also good because the weather is warm and i could enjoy the time i will spend in the camp more.
finally, what kind of weather is waiting for us?
i would like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so i can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing i need to know is the amount of money that i have to bring with me.
how is the weather in California?
i wonder if you could tell me about the weather and what kind of clothes i ought to bring with me.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
in japan, i often play golf but as you know Japanese weather conditions are not good enough for enjoying playing golf, but California has good weather, which means sunshine every day, hopefully.
i would like to ask you about the weather conditions, so i can decide on what clothes to take, and about costs, so i can make a budget for the holiday.
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, please can you tell me about the normal weather for this period?
in the future we won't buy clothes according to size or even colour. our clothes will adapt to our bodies, the weather, our fit, all our needs.
'as i have a choice i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions.
the last thing i would like to know is what clothes i have to take, even though the weather in July will be good.
i think that the cabins are safer than the tents and they can protect you better in case the weather changes.
the restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity. you should clause the theatre until the restaurant can be used.
from there you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, which both take you very clause to the conference centre, and also you can go by underground to get there.
for weeks I'd been planning to go to the theatre with some clause relatives and friends but the problems that we had made this perfect night a disaster for all of us.
about the accommodation during those two weeks, i would rather stay in a log cabin, as it is really difficult for me to stay in a little clause room.
that means for example, while you are sitting in the office you are able to control your home with the computer. you can open and clause the windows and switch the light on and off.
nowadays technical progress gets clause to us, to normal customers.
secondly, i would prefer to stay in a tent because i enjoy being outside clause to nature.
little by little we were growing up and becoming clause friends.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i think i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping clause to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favourite and skillful hobby: sailing.
-are there leisure and entertainment facilities clause to the camp?
a good idea to start will be an alarm clock ringing clause to his bed, because that's the way everyone gets up in the morning (apart from the people who don't do anything).
it was about marine, who was our clause friend.
beside that, I'm allergic, and that causes me problems when I'm clause to nature.
i was living quite clause to potbelly road but i didn't know the area very well because all the time i just had to get off at the corner of my street. but that day, as i was kind of drunk, i didn't realise that the bus took a different route. so, when i noticed it, the driver was already asking me to get off, because we were in the garage in potbelly.
actually, they put me very clause to the stage, in the middle of the real hell.
this modern technology gets closer between person to another person, get clause between worldwide, so that, this modern technology changed our daily life so different.
if we are talking about accommodation then accommodation in tents would be great's love being clause to nature.
i think, next we can film either the development clause or the society clause, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the face clause.
the point of "upper intermediate clause".
spending time together out of the clause is a nice experience.
i think, next we can film either the development clause or the society clause, because in my opinion they are the most interesting classes apart from the face clause.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my clause to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
Sarah looked at him for a while, then she stood in front of the clause and explained to the others that she had won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the coast of southern France and every one of the 19 pupils was invited, except pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
as we have seen the advertisement for the programmer the school arranged for us as a farewell activity, we are very appreciative and would like to thank you for your kindness, as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other clause, which we have hardly done at all.
i was very embarrassed and i wanted to run out of the clause.
I'm writing to you to thank you for the excellent programmer for our English clause in London, especially for the river trip to Greenwich. it will be a great experience for us.
i couldn't believe it. how can this clause of theatre be so..
i have interviewed each student from my English clause.
our clause really appreciate your preparing this programmer, especially with regard to Monday's attraction.
on Monday morning, i walked into the clause and all of my friends were shouting at me and calling my name and my boyfriend.
the reason is that all students are interested in it and the teacher is so good at explaining problems that the whole clause takes part in discussions about specific aspects of the subject.
the whole clause and i would like to thank you for the good programmer which you have organised for our trip to London.
according to statistics based on the questionnaire, the majority of students feel the most enthusiasm for an English clause.
but some naughty students in my clause were throwing paper aeroplanes when the teacher was writing something on the board.
about the accommodation, from the two options, i choose to sleep in a tent, because i think that a log cabin isn't as authentic as a tent, at the camp.
we can choose between two options for spending our free time.
for example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a horse but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for three years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
there are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficult.
according to students 'options, the most popular activities are basketball, tennis, swimming and also the photography group and the painting team.
I'd like to say something that i felt during the festival, and give my options that would be helpful for you to prepare for the next festival.
i hope you will consider my options and that my suggestions will be helpful for next year.
before we can give our options on this statement we have to make sure that everyone knows what we are discussing.
if you want to hear more of my suggestions and options about it please contact me on my cellphone.
this part had to be saved for letter because the concert organiser wanted to know the exact number of visitors.
first of all i would like to say that it started letter than it should have. i had to wait for about fortifier minutes.
that is fortifier minutes letter! it is also advertised that there were discounts available. however, that was another lie.
i was very nervous because I'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't help it and i started crying can imagine, they were so handsome that i couldn't believe Ito tried to calm down because i had to work, and letter i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very stealthy i was workaround it was like a dream.
letter, when the show had finished, i stayed with the group in their room for a few minutes.
expecting British punctuality, we went to the theatre at W to watch the W show but it only started at W. it finished letter than it was supposed to and then we missed the train.
letter when the show finished, i planned to go to the restaurant and get some food, but it was closed, because it was being repaired.
firstly, the musical show started not at 7.30 PM. but 45 minutes letter.
a couple of weeks letter, my sister called me when i was at work; completely devastated and weeping scalding tears, she could hardly pronounce a word.
unfortunately your advertisement said that the show starts at W but it started 45 minutes letter.
a few minutes letter the show started and the group appeared on the stage.
letter, i realised it was the worst thing that could happen to me.
it was about W, i thought it was a bit letter but it wasn't my fault anyway.
one minute letter, pat and half our class stood in 'the house' looking and laughing at me and my flower soup.
the play should have started at 19.30 but it started fortifier minutes letter, we were waiting there without anything to do.
they found him two months letter and six months letter he was in jail.
at first i was surprised but a few seconds letter, when i realised that i wasn't allowed to go, i tried to persuade my teacher to let me go.
sometimes you can stay out all day just to buy a present for someone. it starts in the morning, and of course you have breakfast somewhere, and it gets letter and you are still looking for it, so you have lunch, and finally you spend more money than you thought you would.
they found him two months letter and six months letter he was in jail.
today i received your letter. it is the most wonderful news i have heard in a long time.
i received your letter recently, and i am really happy to learn that i have won the first prize.
i would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competition for two weeks at camp California in the US's.
in your letter you wrote that i will have the chance to do two activities; first of all i would like to play tennis because i have been playing for seven years. secondly i would like to attend a surfing course but i have just some elementary knowledge.
I'm writing to you to answer the letter in which, as you probably know, you congratulated me for having won first prize in your competition and tried to encourage me to travel to California and attend that camp.
with the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. we save the letter and in three weeks we could send it to another person.
i have just received your letter and I'm very happy because of it, especially because the competition was so hard.
I'm writing to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter, so referring to the question of when i would like to travel, i would like to go anytime during July, because i have to be back home in august, because i need to apply and get everything sorted out, to go to college next September.
i am writing to you in order to give a reply to the kind letter i received from you.
my name is Joseph and i am writing this letter to complain about the mess that the administration of the circle theatre presented to me.
the activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
i am writing in reply to your letter in which you told me i won the first prize.
i have just received your letter informing me that i won a two week holiday at camp California, so i am writing to you to tell you my preferences for the travel and the accommodation.
i am writing this letter to complain about your advertisement for the musical show "over the rainbow", which is misleading in a number of ways.
in your letter, you asked me whether the book I've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday.
you can send a letter to your friend by email instead of writing it on a piece of paper and sending it by post.
thank you for your letter.
i am writing in reply to your letter. i am glad to have won the first prize in your competition for two weeks at camp California in the USA.
i am writing to thank you for notifying me about the competition and i would be very grateful to give to you the information that was requested in your letter.
i was one of the luckiest people from my school to be pieced to help at the pop concert which took place in my town.
of course you know I'm a singer, so i came back quickly to my home, i pieced up my microphone, and i handed it to the singer.
it was really a reasonably pieced weekend for me, but you should also introduce new activities like competitions in singing songs or drawing a portrait next year.
we chose some of them and we were glad that we had our reasonably pieced ticket for all the events because we could change our plans during the event.
they believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because they will be outgoing, amazing, etc.
it is amazing and sometimes amazing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is.
second i got to the theatre at 19.20 because in the advertisement it clearly states that the show starts at 19.30, and i got really mad when i looked at my watch and noticed that i had been waiting for 40 (forty) minutes and the show hadn't started yet... i mean it was amazing!
i always had considered myself to be very lucky to be born in the century because of all the amazing human inventions.
i chose climbing because I'm interested in this sport even thought I'm not experienced.
in wars sailors communicate with mobile phones thought places to place to get or give information about themselves and the enemy.
the last thing i would like to know is what clothes i have to take, even thought the weather in July will be good.
plus, it is mentioned in your advertisement that discounts are available. in fact, no discount was given to me, thought i am a student and as a student i was entitled to get a discount but i paid £ 20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show.
however, i could enjoy it, even thought i was a beginner, so i would like to practise and have fun at the camp.
the hour fight is described in such a peaceful, faithful way that it callas a thought about life and death.
even thought pat has got a great sense of humour and wonderful personality, he'll never be able to keep any secrets from anyone, even himself.
in particular, i liked cleaning the stage, because i could stand on a famous singer's stage and i could feel his enthusiasm, even thought i had to clean it.
i must say thought, i would have to travel in July because it's the summer holidays for schools and i would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if that is possible.
sometimes, i think i am a computer addict because whenever i come back home, my hand goes to the computer switch, automatically, even thought i don't want to use the computer.
even thought i think most of the time it is very interesting, sometimes it gets people upset.
i had a really nice time with them even thought i would've preferred to stay at the front with the other people,
it is not always like that but we often see such a scene, even thought shopping is becoming an entertainment not only for teenagers but also for adults.
not only because she's famous and wrote lots of books, but she knows how to introduce characters and how to tell a good story us thought deceiving the readers.
Danny brook is one of my favourite actors so i decided to buy a ticket even thought i had to cancel my appointment on that day at 18.30 and also notice of price discount impressed me.
even thought the advertisement said we should visit it after the show, it was closed and no explanations were given.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even thought it was very hard at the beginning.
painting always did fascinate me, even thought I'm not so good at it, but my friends say i can really paint and they love the things i do. the technique i like the most is watercolours.
after a few seconds of thought i went straight to pat. "why, why did you do that?"
i thought that Danny brook, who is my favourite actor, would perform in that show.
and when we understood the internet, we thought that meeting people from other countries and being able "to chat" with them was the height of technology.
as you know, we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country!
i thought i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
then i thought that i should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that i couldn't say that i had wasted my time by coming here.
you know that i always wanted to help at a concert. to be part of the staff would be wonderful, i thought. and i was right!
i read the advertisement and i thought it was going to be a pleasant evening.
i didn't see any discounts available; i thought my son would have paid less than i. as we had already missed the first we went to the theatre restaurant, which is famous for its good food, however, it was closed.
we thought that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
you've got more stress, you feel fed up and finally when you get home you think that shopping is not as enjoyable as you thought.
we had never been to a musical show and we thought that it was a new opportunity.
pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined.
i know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what i thought when i was asked to help, but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party wasn't as successful as we thought.
when i received your advertisement concerning the show "over the rainbow" i thought that I'd have a great evening, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me.
i have already thought about a change to the programmer.
it was a pity but it did not annoy me because i thought that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 for.
when you go shopping and there are a lot of people in the same place, all trying to find the best prices and not carrying about anybody, this could drive anyone crazy.
after carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about three hours, i was exhausted.
and please could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes i will have to bring?
can you believe it, it was mob. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he gave me a shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the mob concert and everything, thank you.
if you want to hear more of my suggestions and opinions about it please contact me on my cellphone.
i thought you understood '; please send money back to me, you know why, don't answer me?
and please tell me how much money i am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation.
lastly, can you please tell me how much money would be appropriate to take?
can you please give me some recommendations about the clothes i will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget.
i hope to give you all the information you need and, please, if you want more information or something is not clear, please don't hesitate to contact me again.
please reply at your earliest convenience.
could you, please send me some extra information regarding the amount of money i should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes i should take.
i hope to give you all the information you need and, please, if you want more information or something is not clear, please don't hesitate to contact me again.
i would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and please inform us of your decision as soon as possible.
Anna told her again: "pat don't tell anyone please, especially my brother, everything would be ruined then". and pat answered: "don't worry i won't tell anyone".
please, if you would be so kind correct this mistake. i would be grateful if you could correct too that show starts at 20.15 not on 19.30.
i made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha's friends with a note: "do not tell Agatha about this. this is a surprise party for her. please keep the secret!" pat arranged a great DJ and drinks.
please, when you receive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything.
if you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to contact me.
could you please tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, please can you tell me about the normal weather for this period?
please could you send me an itinerary of the trip?
please note that alcoholic drinks are only sold until PM.
concerning the accommodation's be informed that i would prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i think that the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities have chosen tennis and photography.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money that I'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
it could be any day but please let me know nearer the time.
could you please let me know where i will eat? if there will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
and please do not be very surprised if you receive more letters about this.
that is very nice that all costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the US's. and please tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change this activity.
i hope i have given you enough information and if you still have some questions, please do not hesitate to contact us.
please let us know as soon as you make your decision.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
if this is an inconvenience, please feel free to tell me.
so if it's possible could you arrange it for me please.
the please I'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where I'm sure I'd feel more comfortable than in a tent.
basketball is the most popular activity, which takes please between W PM pm from Monday to Friday every week.
i would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: it is "the London fashion and leisure show", which is going to take please at the central exhibition hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th march, between 10.00 and 19.00.
i was one of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took please in my town.
i got into the car and gave the jewellery in exchange for my brother, took him and left the please.
first of all i helped with the decoration of the please where the concert would take please.
finally, i would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a please for a campsite so that people who come a long way don't have to spend money on accommodation.
if it is possible i want a log cabin for my accommodation because i have been suffering with my back since my childhood, therefore i need a comfortable please to sleep.
there were lasers all over the please, which i had to be careful of.
in the advertisement, it said that Danny brook was starring, but in please of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing.
for example, once people had to walk from one please to another, but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol-powered vehicles and we can travel faster with them.
the old town is the best please for an afternoon stroll, with a great deal of restaurants, cafes and street performers.
without any doubt, it is a historical please which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history during the passing of the centuries.
subject: recommendations for a please to visit
after a long time walking we decided to return and now the weather was so hot we decided to find a please to drink something.
we arrived quite early because we had to work out how we were going to serve people did with which order, so we started putting all the stuff in the appropriate please.
your group has been booked into the palace hotel, which is situated in the city centre, 15 minutes 'walk from where the conference takes please.
i had to keep things in please and check that the microphones were working properly.
which special please in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall centre, from different areas of the city.
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a please with extended pollution's think there will be many such places in a hundred yearned a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
after all of this we saw the show from the best please, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
in wars sailors communicate with mobile phones though places to please to get or give information about themselves and the enemy.
the show is going to take please in the general exhibition hall in London, Thursday the 14 of march, so it could be a good idea to see this show instead of going to the science museum.
although i like camping and sharing with different kinds of people, I'd prefer a comfortable and private please (if it's possible) where i can sleep, or be quiet.. i am not a teenager!
i am writing in response to the international arts festival, which took please on W November.
but the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the "London fashion and leisure show", which will take please in the central exhibition hall, London, on Tuesday march 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. at the same time we have to go to the science museum but we would all like to go to the show.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public please and there are too many people.
i helped them to prepare the room for the bands and i decorated the please for the singers.
there was a secret please where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
it will be good for your group because you don't need to move to another please.
my name is Mani rodeos and i am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show over the rainbow, which took please in your establishment, the circle theatre, which made me feel very upset.
I'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent. and with the tent i can go to another please in the camp.
and please could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes i will have to bring?
can you believe it, it was mob. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he gave me a shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the mob concert and everything, thank you.
if you want to hear more of my suggestions and opinions about it please contact me on my cellphone.
i thought you understood '; please send money back to me, you know why, don't answer me?
and please tell me how much money i am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation.
lastly, can you please tell me how much money would be appropriate to take?
they need to be with their family in please.
i felt an enormous please.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green please will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
that is the most important reason why i only like to go shopping in small stores, where i have please and quiet and very often nothing to complain about.
you can't go outside in please, and there is always a crowd of people who stand in front of your house waiting for you.
although modern technology gives you many comfortable things for living, can it give you nature, please and fresh air?
at all schools there is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, there are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the caldera centre, which is a very special bath centre.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
there are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity. you should close the theatre until the restaurant can be used.
there are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
there were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
English: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there.
there are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
I'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're there.
on video there should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that there can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, there were none.
first of all, there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, there was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so there was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that I'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be there and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, there was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, there were only six nationalities.
apart from that, the show was delayed fortifier minutes, consequently, everybody there lost control and became angry.
she was sent to new York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because they wanted to build a trade centre there.
there are some things i would like to ask about: the type (and quantity) of clothes i will have to take, and if it is necessary to take some money or any additional stuff (like raincoats).
from there to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus, which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town centre.
then, i was planning to buy three £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! i, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so many magnificent events.
the activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (there must be beautiful pictures to take in California).
you can't imagine how many people are involved in the organization of a concert. apart from the musicians and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security... it was so exciting!
there, Jacob approaches him slowly and tells him.
are there any discotheques or something? i would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her i can't be there.
i went to buy a ticket and as i like to enjoy the show near the stage i bought a £ 20 ticket but when i asked for a discount they told me, "i am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement. it will be impossible to give you a discount".
firstly, this is because there are a lot of scandal magazine readers.
all my family liked the films and the plays that there were very much, but i personally think that it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
there is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
could you please let me know where i will eat? if there will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
it's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freely, and there are no teachers. it could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons.
for the accommodation at camp California, i would prefer to have a log cabin because i think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case there is a big storm with heavy rain. a log cabin's more resistant than a tent.
it's quite difficult for me because there are 4 of them i like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if i have to make a choice, i choose climbing and surfing.
to make matters worse, we have never had the opportunity to see Danny brook because, instead, there was a different actor!
finally i want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because there aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
i don't know much about the weather down there, in California, so i am rather puzzled about what to wear there.
i don't think that I'd enjoy it, all the people kicking you, you can't walk properly or buy anything. and also there are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops. i mean that some people can fight to get something.
an international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die there were stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
the advertisement also says that there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
you will find there an amazing collection of old weapons, armour and, we are especially proud of it, the great collection of swords.
there is, as well, the struggle you have to endure when you find yourself in the crowds, crammed in the small shops during the only layoff you have to buy something you like.
if you compare the fashion now with that of 100 years ago, you'll notice that there are incredibly big differences between them.
in addition to this, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
first, i got there at W pm, because the show was about to start at W pm, and i needed some time to buy the tickets. i bought two tickets for £ 20 and when i asked for a discount, they didn't give me one, then i was kept waiting for the show to start until W pm.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be there, my favourite actor, but there was someone else instead of him.
i didn't need to pay an entrance fee because i was working there.
what is more, you advertised there were discounts available but there were not.
there was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
if Danny brook does not appear, you have to say something about this to the people who are there in the theatre. this is your unforgivable mistake.
there were no discounts available so i overspent.
i stood at the entrance and there i had to check the tickets.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that there would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
and the theatre restaurant was being painted, so i could not go there.
it's not that problem that there was no more discount available i had chosen it, because I'm (allowed?).
and the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
it is one of the most comfortable hotels in our city and situated only half a mile from the main building of our college, so it is very simple to get from there to the conference by foot.
also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes there are planned visits to historical places.
there are many facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
the task was not easy, at 18 you don't know too much about cryptography algorithms and databases but anyway we decided to do it. there was nothing to lose.
because of it our state can't pay workers in schools, hospitals, on building sites. in our country there is a high number of unemployed.
however, i feel that at the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution that has been created and it seems that it's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
i am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while i am there. because of my studies, i will take painting, as this is the subject which i am finishing at college, always with important qualifications, and photography which has been my hobby since i discovered that i can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
first of all, there were no discounts available such as were promised in the advertisement so i had to pay the original price which wasn't cheap at all.
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall centre, from different areas of the city.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still I'm happy, that i could be there.
there are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in their private life.
from there you can get a taxi, catch the number seven and eleven buses, which both take you very close to the conference centre, and also you can go by underground to get there.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get their pay first.
also it was written in the advertisement that some discounts were available, but there weren't any discounts.
they decided to build more schools, especially in Switzerland because the people there were considered clever.
but when we got into the house there were all my friends!
in fact there were a lot of mistakes in your advertisement and i would be grateful if you could give me back a part of my money.
there were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisement.
but there was a little problem and it was that my parents didn't let me go to discos alone, so i had to go illegally, and i decided i would do it.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the centre of the town because there are many places to have a look at and go shopping.
likewise, there were no discounts available.
history: at the castle there are always a few guides, who will show someone around and tell him about the history of the castle (when it was built, by whom and why), which makes everyone enthusiastic.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so there was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that I'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
is there a possibility of exchanging different currencies to us dollars?
at the camp, is there a free uniform or will we have to wear something special?
in the advertisement you say that there is a discount available but there was not.
i prefer that kind of accommodation because i can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but i can't have it in a tent.
if you have never been there, i really recommend you to go.
there is no need to bother about clothes.
how are you? I'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help there and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
the performances were great, but some halls were too small to accommodate all the people who were there that day.
at the end of the conference there will be a reception at the hotel.
there are Emacs cinema, museums, a gallery.
i love sports so i would like to play some basketball at the camp. by the way, my team and i won the last school championship. i play guard on my team. i also like tennis but i am not very good. i was wondering if you could give me some lessons while i am there.
the advertisement promised there would be my favourite star, Danny brook, but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
in your advertisement you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately i found out only six countries were represented.
but you can't play if there is too much wind, because the ball becomes uncontrollable!
sometimes, there are so many people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
in my situation for example cars and motorcycles are a necessity: i live on a little mountain at 160 metres altitude so i cannot go to the city using a bicycle. because of my "isolation" the telephone is very important and i need a good personal computer with a modem and the internet to study or do research, because there are not any book shops to buy or borrow books in my little town.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel three, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
actually, i read the advertisement for the show and there were a few mistakes in it.
there were lasers all over the place, which i had to be careful of.
the advertisement promised there would be my favourite star, Danny brook, but there was another actor who could not play his part as well as Danny brook. in addition, the performance started 45 minutes late, so we couldn't visit your theatre restaurant after the show because it was closed already.
there is a great opportunity to go there because students need not pay anything.
because all the smells in the market are awfuller is the smell of the meat and dirty water, black and smelly water, all over the market street.
the people who were there to watch the show were very angry and they were shouting because they had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
people won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certainly be synthetic, because there won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be there, my favourite actor, but there was someone else instead of him.
it was also written in the show's advertisement that there would be discounts available on the tickets.
finally you said there was a restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything until we got home.
after all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad. i think i can only forgive your theatre if you give me a refund of the money i spent there, and some more for all the problems i had.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether there is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find there.
and now of course there will be someone trying to improve it.
well on march 11th there was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favourites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
there has been a change in the relationships between people.
when pat first came into a class or a group of teenagers there were no problems.
there are huge queues to the tills, noise, hassle, poor customer service.
i had read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there weren't.
i had read in the advertisement that there were some discounts available but there weren't.
so, after all of that, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice that the restaurant wasn't open.
in Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict.
firstly, you advertised that Danny brook, who is my favourite, is the lead but there was another actor instead of him.
i was looking forward to a great evening, but much to my surprise, that was not exactly the case: there were no discounts available, such as were mentioned in the advertisement; the show started 45 minutes late; i was then very disappointed to see that Danny brook had been replaced by someone else.
for example there were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance.
to sum up, there is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of money, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
also, i want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but there weren't enough of them for me.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are many different kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on makeup and how to have appropriate hairstyles.
and the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.
finally i want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
moreover, once i was paying for the tickets, i found another thing out: there were no discounts available.
secondly for us there are disadvantages because pollution affects us indirectly, and because i don't do anything but watch television, and it isn't very good at all.
i think it is very convenient for the group. you know the Victoria area, it is easy to travel from there to the rest of the city. about the hotel, it is clean, and provides a good service. the rooms are doubles and each has its own bathroom and for the number of students we are getting good value. and the best way to get to the college for the conference is to walk to Victoria station, get the tram to glister road and after 3 blocks on the Lufthansa side you will find the college.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
it is easy to get there and free admission.
also there is a very good shopping centre next to the museum.
me and my friend were there to hear the soundcheck, and when i understood what was happening on the stage, i decided to help them.
there is a very big library.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have there problems, there affairs, there private lives just as normal people do.
edit bedder even talked to me about there programmers!
i have friends that are studying in other schools and they are very happy with there freedom.
they are ready to sacrifice all there savings to get something that will make there neighbour jealous.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve there problem all together.
all the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with there difficult tasks.
most young people like carol believe the same and use there minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future.
i particularly liked listening to there musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon there lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect there human rights.
nick and dick could prove there bravery stealing there mother's panties.
the dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of there movements.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for there excursion and because of there interests.
in addition, shop owners often cheat there customers by increasing the cost secretly.
amazingly, doctors tell people to look after there bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.
on the other hand, there life has no privacy.
people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting there mobility.
the historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: there freedom.
people won't be embarrassed to show the beauty of there bodies.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in there education, job and there marriage in future.
with it people do there work more quickly and successfully.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for there excursion and because of there interests.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend there free time more actively can often visit there friends and travel much more.
it allowed people to enjoy there weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening there knowledge.
it is as if they lose there conscience while they are shopping.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in there education, job and there marriage in future.
what i most appreciated was that they gave me there latest CD with there signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, I've given one to you.
her parents have been so upset that they have asked the school to help there child and that is the reason why I'm writing this story.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at there tables doing there homework.
firstly, the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving there knowledge.
the time had come. the who groups had combined there forces and were ready to strike.
designers are unique in a way but there designs are sometimes more a piece of art and not for everyday purposes.
poisonous chemical compounds, EEG. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming there brain and there bodies, and it can also cause death.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from there relations with journalists because of there work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
our whole life is being simplified by machines for not waste the time to work on there development.
it seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because students always make some mistakes while they are practising with there partner, in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times.
but for there considerations, they're working in there routines.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know there preferences regarding this choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
they need to be with there family in peace.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend there free time more actively can often visit there friends and travel much more.
science and technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved there way of life.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve there work, politicians for there campaigns and film stars to make there latest movie famous.
i have got some experience already and I'm used to any weather conditions, furthermore i simply love water sports and there challenges.
why must everybody know and talk about there private life?
men tease women for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as there favourite pastime.
they are the main characters of that book, and what characterizes them is the violence of there passions.
what i really liked doing was helping them with there clothes and makeup, because i learnt how to do makeup for someone and i spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the world.
now i only need to push a button, and things or machines work on there own.
when choosing this style of life they should realise what there life would be like.
i would make schools less stressful, with added fun 'cause that way it's easier to learn and i would give students more chances to share there fantasies at school.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in there house because there aren't convenient appliances in there houses yet.
some people use them in there work, others wish to sit in one by the end of the day and for some other people a wheelchair represents the possibility of movement.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for there clothes.
they could not believe there eyes.
on the other hand, there stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create there own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
I've had the honour of helping there sound engineer and branching the cables for microphones, guitars etc.
in conclusion, i believe that we have a right to be informed about there lives, providing that journalists respect some important rules.
in order to fulfil there readers 'requirements they constantly follow them.
but for there considerations, they're working in there routines.
there are large numbers of journalists following them all the time, even in there private life.
nowadays women wear really short skirts, short shirts, short tops, and cut there hair short just like men.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have there problems, there affairs, there private lives just as normal people do.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in there house because there aren't convenient appliances in there houses yet.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve there work, politicians for there campaigns and film stars to make there latest movie famous.
so they prefer to leave there sons watching TV.
first, the actors that the circle theatre publicised on there tickets for over the rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
actually most people work hard to earn there money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
there hobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a chair without doing anything.
and the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as there parents and have a happy family.
we can see students expressing there feelings, wonderful and exciting story that the student made up or from a well welkin story.
when the sons were old they began to talk about there life, beginning with this story, which happened a long time ago.
poisonous chemical compounds, EEG. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming there brain and there bodies, and it can also cause death.
let us try to appreciate there importance again.
after all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got there signatures.
a lot of countries buy guns, for there defence they say, but they buy them to kill people.
i mean, it's still unbelievable. can you imagine how like a dream it was to be shaking there hands.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve there work, politicians for there campaigns and film stars to make there latest movie famous.
i sometimes lose my desire to buy a thing because of there bad behaviour.
only those who get good marks can take part in these activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on there faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
in the last forty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using there car.
what i most appreciated was that they gave me there latest CD with there signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, I've given one to you.
the best thing was that i have learned how to take care of there expensive instruments and i have sung my favourite songs with them.
nowadays the majority of people have a computer in there home and sometimes we ask ourselves if modern technology will change our daily life.
the churches and the cathedral are very interesting because of there different romantic styles.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get there pay first.
instead of going to the theatre, which is more cultural, or even having a picnic at Jayapura park, people prefer spending all there money at shopping centres.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at there tables doing there homework.
they can relax, reduce there stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price for there clothes.
what is important is not there fashion but there knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
because of everything i have said i am more likely to think that the benefits of people's inventions are much greater than all there disadvantages.
they are ready to sacrifice all there savings to get something that will make there neighbour jealous.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon there lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect there human rights.
since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, there lives have been far easier than before.
it informs people, hospitals use modern technology, and the computer helps standers and helps people do there job.
i had a chance to talk to them about there jobs and it was amazing!
this technological improvement is changing people's lives, behaviour, even there homes.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from there relations with journalists because of there work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes there life miserable.
however, i would add that journalist's aware of that hard topical try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have there own private life exposed!
they are human beings and they need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in there lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for there cars, motorbikes or computers.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about there last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
to sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern there sports activities as well.
research has shown that almost every single household owns a PC. some people use them for there job because they need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for there money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back's bank account number is enclosed.
there is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for there families and friends.
it is very interesting for me how new works, there possibilities.
but even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in there showrooms.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend there leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than there home.
none of the groups are known at the moment, but i believe they are well on there way to becoming famous bands.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased there production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who live in third world countries.
it allowed people to enjoy there weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening there knowledge.
on the other hand, there stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create there own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
there lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funny.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take there pictures, because although they are famous they also have there private life.
in addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £ 10. this was excellent. it meant people only spent Pokemon, and then they could watch all the events at the weekend. for them it is a really economical way to spend there weekend.
in 100 years, it's possible that everyone will develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, as a way to create there own clothes.
peter and sue asked Francis for some help with there exam subjects and Francis, all week, was too busy to help them.
famous people must understand that the journalists are doing there job.
my main work was to take people to there seats because of a concert hall, which was the millennium dome.
i helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with there guitars!
furthermore, most of the famous brand of sportswear companies will be at this exhibition with there new products for the coming season.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have there problems, there affairs, there private lives just as normal people do.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend there leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than there home.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match there new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and they develop there own styles which suit them the most.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended there friendship with pat because there popularity was damaged.
future students could appreciate coming if they could still do there sport.
boys pierce there bodies just like girls do and vice versa.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse there show. i could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take there pictures, because although they are famous they also have there private life.
what is important is not there fashion but there knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on there levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have there wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
i carried a lot of chairs and looked after the queue or people who lost there way.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine there face clearly.
about a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, they cooked there food on the fire and they didn't have pens.
this is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing there jobs.
in fact, now i can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for example, in the morning and receive there answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing.
nick and dick could prove there bravery stealing there mother's panties.
there are always, at the end of the afternoon, some weltered women coming from there offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
i think that the government have to protect them and there private life from the journalists, by punishing journalists.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended there friendship with pat because there popularity was damaged.
by the way, i have already been invited to there next concert.
later, when the show had finished, i stayed with the group in there room for a few minutes.
you don't have to Waite at a bus stop in cold and windy weather for a late bus, or be stuck on a train for an hour due to some track repairs. you can just jump into a car, tune your radio to your favourite station and have a pleasant drive to your destination.
first of all i would like to say that it started later than it should have. i had to Waite for about fortifier minutes.
it was so boring to Waite for the show in a noisy and hot theatre.
after that you have to Waite a long time in the queue to pay and many times it isn't possible to pay with your credit card and you don't have any money in cash.
regarding starting time and the theatre restaurant, to see the musical i had to Waite about 45 minutes because it started at W.
i mean, it is too crowded, you have to Waite such a long time before you can pay, and most of the things are too expensive!
one day, when the old man went into the bamboo bush, he found some bamboo gritted Waite.
she was so angry and felt so betrayed by Mr Waite that without any hesitation she went to the school headmaster to report everything she had seen.
and if you climb to the top of the main tower's keep's will see unforgettable views of a Waite town.
for the party i suggest you wear classic clothes; maybe something black and not red or pink. i am going to wear classic black trousers and a Waite Jesuit might be that this information gives you some idea too.
then i drove very slowly very often crossing the Waite line on the road.
woods is thought to stand for all Waite people and this book could have an influence on them.
and place could you give me some details about what the weather is like there and what type of clothes i will have to bring?
can you believe it, it was mob. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he gave me a shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and place tell everybody about the mob concert and everything, thank you.

i thought you understood '; place send money back to me, you know why, don't answer me?
and place tell me how much money i am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation.
lastly, can you place tell me how much money would be appropriate to take?
can you place give me some recommendations about the clothes i will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget.

i hope to give you all the information you need and, place, if you want more information or something is not clear, place don't hesitate to contact me again.
i would be grateful if you could consider our suggestion and place inform us of your decision as soon as possible.
Anna told her again: "pat don't tell anyone place, especially my brother, everything would be ruined then". and pat answered: "don't worry i won't tell anyone".
place, if you would be so kind correct this mistake. i would be grateful if you could correct too that show starts at 20.15 not on 19.30.
i made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha's friends with a note: "do not tell Agatha about this. this is a surprise party for her. place keep the secret!" pat arranged a great DJ and drinks.
place, when you receive this letter give me a call so we can arrange everything.
if you have any further questions, place do not hesitate to contact me.
could you place tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, place can you tell me about the normal weather for this period?
place could you send me an itinerary of the trip?
place note that alcoholic drinks are only sold until PM.
concerning the accommodation's be informed that i would prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i think that the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities have chosen tennis and photography.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money that I'm going to spend, so if you, place, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
it could be any day but place let me know nearer the time.
could you place let me know where i will eat? if there will be a vegetarian menu? and how much is it?
and place do not be very surprised if you receive more letters about this.
that is very nice that all costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the US's. and place tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change this activity.
i hope i have given you enough information and if you still have some questions, place do not hesitate to contact us.
place let us know as soon as you make your decision.
place could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
if this is an inconvenience, place feel free to tell me.
so if it's possible could you arrange it for me place.
the place I'd prefer to stay in is a log cabin, where I'm sure I'd feel more comfortable than in a tent.
basketball is the most popular activity, which takes place between W PM pm from Monday to Friday every week.
i would like to tell you about the show which we would like to see: it is "the London fashion and leisure show", which is going to take place at the central exhibition hall in London, on Tuesday the 14th march, between 10.00 and 19.00.
i was one of the luckiest people from my school to be picked to help at the pop concert which took place in my town.
i got into the car and gave the jewellery in exchange for my brother, took him and left the place.
first of all i helped with the decoration of the place where the concert would take place.
finally, i would like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come a long way don't have to spend money on accommodation.
if it is possible i want a log cabin for my accommodation because i have been suffering with my back since my childhood, therefore i need a comfortable place to sleep.
there were lasers all over the place, which i had to be careful of.
in the advertisement, it said that Danny brook was starring, but in place of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing.
for example, once people had to walk from one place to another, but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol-powered vehicles and we can travel faster with them.
the old town is the best place for an afternoon stroll, with a great deal of restaurants, cafes and street performers.
without any doubt, it is a historical place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history during the passing of the centuries.
subject: recommendations for a place to visit
after a long time walking we decided to return and now the weather was so hot we decided to find a place to drink something.
we arrived quite early because we had to work out how we were going to serve people did with which order, so we started putting all the stuff in the appropriate place.
your group has been booked into the palace hotel, which is situated in the city centre, 15 minutes 'walk from where the conference takes place.
i had to keep things in place and check that the microphones were working properly.
which special place in the town will be left just as a commercial area, but of course with all the facilities to get there, like a big supermarket and mall centre, from different areas of the city.
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution's think there will be many such places in a hundred yearned a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
after all of this we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
in wars sailors communicate with mobile phones though places to place to get or give information about themselves and the enemy.
the show is going to take place in the general exhibition hall in London, Thursday the 14 of march, so it could be a good idea to see this show instead of going to the science museum.
although i like camping and sharing with different kinds of people, I'd prefer a comfortable and private place (if it's possible) where i can sleep, or be quiet.. i am not a teenager!
i am writing in response to the international arts festival, which took place on W November.
but the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the "London fashion and leisure show", which will take place in the central exhibition hall, London, on Tuesday march 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. at the same time we have to go to the science museum but we would all like to go to the show.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
i helped them to prepare the room for the bands and i decorated the place for the singers.
there was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.
it will be good for your group because you don't need to move to another place.
my name is Mani rodeos and i am writing to complain about some things that happened at the performance of the show over the rainbow, which took place in your establishment, the circle theatre, which made me feel very upset.
I'd prefer to take a tent because it is more romantic and exciting to spend nights in a tent. and with the tent i can go to another place in the camp.
the weather had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
about accommodation at camp California, i would rather be in a tent than in a log cabin because in July the weather is really good and when i am in a tent i feel closer to nature.
we thought that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
July is also good because the weather is warm and i could enjoy the time i will spend in the camp more.
finally, what kind of weather is waiting for us?
i would like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so i can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing i need to know is the amount of money that i have to bring with me.
how is the weather in California?
i wonder if you could tell me about the weather and what kind of clothes i ought to bring with me.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
in japan, i often play golf but as you know Japanese weather conditions are not good enough for enjoying playing golf, but California has good weather, which means sunshine every day, hopefully.
i would like to ask you about the weather conditions, so i can decide on what clothes to take, and about costs, so i can make a budget for the holiday.
in order to know what sort of clothes i have to take, please can you tell me about the normal weather for this period?
in the future we won't buy clothes according to size or even colour. our clothes will adapt to our bodies, the weather, our fit, all our needs.
'as i have a choice i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because they seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions.
i don't know weather it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their money, or weather it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back's bank account number is enclosed.
i would like to ask weather you have competitions or different activities.
in your letter, you asked me weather the book I've read would be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday.
before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and weather there is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
first of all, the advertisement i got placed emphasis on Danny brook's starring in the show, but actually, a disappointing, unknown actor played his part, and i wonder weather he had real skills.
i don't know weather it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their money, or weather it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back's bank account number is enclosed.
i would like to ask you how much money i need, how the weather is, in order to pack the necessary clothing, and weather i need anything else.
finally, i would like to ask you weather there is anything i should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
from my point of view it depends on us weather shopping will be enjoyable or not.
weather there is a phone, a fax or email so i can be in touch with my family.
it must be our decision weather to stay and eat there, or not.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all weather i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between these two I'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
in addition i need to know weather meals are included or not with the accommodation so that i can decide how much i must have with me.
finally, i would like to ask you weather i have to prepare any special clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me.
could you please tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and weather the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
you can send a letter to your friend by email instead of writing it on a Pierce of paper and sending it by post.
often people can't buy a Pierce of bread. and they ask for money from other people.
designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a Pierce of art and not for everyday purposes.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a Pierce of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
when i asked for the Pierce i was surprised because the assistant told me there wasn't any discount available.
nearly at the end of this letter i have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap Pierce.
furthermore you had mentioned some discounts in your advertisement, but i had to pay the full Pierce although i am a student.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full Pierce, at the end of the season it is half Pierce. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
regarding the accommodation, i would be pleased to stay in a tent, because thees reminds me of my holidays with my family.
thank you for giving me thees opportunity.
finally, food shops should be added to thees festival next year because only plays and films were not attractive enough to get audiences.
thees modern technology gets closer between person to another person, get close between worldwide, so that, thees modern technology changed our daily life so different.
i would like to thank you once again for thees great opportunity.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money that I'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me thees information i would be very pleased.
so thees is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in thees show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from makeup artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
but after thees servile work i met Eminem.
your advertisement for the show contains further inaccuracies; thees show did not start at 19.30 PM but only at 20.15.
furthermore you can play with the computer, and unfortunately thees fact especially has changed my life.
I'd like you to send the money to thees address: UL Galloway 10
I'm very happy about thees because i spent most of my school life playing sports, especially basketball.
i am really looking forward to thees holiday.
in conclusion, i can say that thees is not the biggest problem that the world has and-- it is not my problem because i am not famous!
i think thees topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view, because we can study the subject's reactions before, during and after shopping.
thees story happened two years ago.
that is very nice that all costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the US's. and please tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change thees activity.
I'm writing thees letter to complain about the musical show i saw during my stay in London.
it said in the leaflet that thees would be a perfect evening out, while it was not that at all.
now then, how was thees advertising, it was completely different. i am really disappointed with your musical. i am asking you for my money back, because i didn't enjoy your musical.
we would like to ask if we could go to thees show on the 15th march instead of doing the visit to the science museum.
some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing, that all the time thees makes you feel complete and also they think that if you are famous you are special as well.
it was great that you organised the arts festival in thees city, because people really need thees kind of social activity here.
if you have thees opportunity one day, you had better buy the ticket to the concert or just watch it on TV but never do something like thees just to get a free pass.
i am very keen on photography so i definitely will choose thees as one of my activities at the camp.
in thees book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we want something, we can get it, it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it.
in conclusion, the advertisement promised thees would be a perfect evening out, but it was not, so i would like to ask for my money back.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of thees is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
i remember when i had the first lesson at the university and the teacher took us to the computer centre and i saw these machines, all my colleagues and i were laughing was very difficult to imagine how you can work with thees kind of computer.
what kind of an organisation do you call thees, sir/ madam?
now, it is already possible to send our shopping list by computer, and thees option, in the next few years, will become the most common one.
firstly, the environment is polluted because of technology, although thees is our fault.
anyway, in families they usually have thees problem that when they buy a new one, suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
i do not have words to express how happy i am. i would like to thank you and camp California for thees opportunity.
you wrote an advertisement saying that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit thees concert, but there were artists from only 6 countries.
i prefer thees accommodation because i think it's easier to meet people when you stay in a tent, near them, than when you stay in a log cabin.
the rest of the activities were very interesting for us, we learnt a lot of things and we met a lot of interesting people, and all of thees without being expensive. i think that the ticket was excellent for us because of its price.
i asked some people in town and thees was the best place to choose.
so thees is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real world of fashion design, because in thees show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from makeup artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
and finally, i would have had my dinner after thees disappointing musical and thought i would go to 'theatre restaurant'.
in thees letter you ask me for some further information for my convenience for thees trip.
finally, i would like to ask you whether there is anything i should bring on thees trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.
i am really surprised for the information because i won, and i would like to say thank you for everything. thees is why i wrote and sent thees letter with the information you need i can only travel in July because it is the only time when i can do it before for my work i do not really care what accommodation i will have. i would prefer to come in July i will be available for the moment. i would really appreciate it if you could tell the people who work at camp California i choose the golf and photography because i think i am really interested in those subjects. i am not really really good but i have some experience.
you wrote that your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? i think thees is the best choice for him!
thees is something i will never ever forget.
i think that one reasonably-priced weekend ticket for all events is an excellent idea because it isn't so expensive as buying a ticket for each event, and with thees ticket you can visit everything you want.
in thees letter you ask me for some further information for my convenience for thees trip.
the aim of thees report is to describe the biggest building of our town.
i am writing thees letter to complain about your advertisement for the musical show "over the rainbow", which is misleading in a number of ways.
i made beautiful invitations for all of Agatha's friends with a note: "do not tell Agatha about thees. thees is a surprise party for her. please keep the secret!" pat arranged a great DJ and drinks.
we started to put everything on the stage and after thees we realized that the band was coming onto the stage near us.
i am very disappointed with thees evening and with thees disorganised way of dealing with problems so i am asking for my money back.
thees is because i intend to take an examination in September.
nowadays, in the year 2000 we still practise thees ancient art but in a different way, we don't use weapons for hunting animals in the jungle, we use the remote to hunt TV shows, and we do not collect vegetables any more, we go shopping.
i would be grateful if you could include thees show in your programmer.
after all of thees we saw the show from the best place, near the stage and afterwards, the thing that i most liked, we were invited to see the group and got their signatures.
people are getting more and more addicted to thees, because it helps to make everyday life easier and more comfortable.
most of the time he gets lost, or they start playing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... and when thees happens you get in a bad mood and you'll have a bad day shopping.
thees was the best part because when everyone was gone, billy Joel arrived to give his support to the beginners!!!
the man said it was OK thees time and we got in quite easily, we'd made it.
the modern technologies mean i am able to listen the music I've downloaded with the same quality as a CD, and if i buy a reproductive, i can carry thees music everywhere.
in thees book, heathcliff as a child wasn't a bad character, but the situations he lived through with the earnshaw family, where he grew up, made him rude, aggressive and noisy.
in addition to thees, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
secondly, another problem was the starting time. according to your advertisement, the play starts at 19.30 but instead it started at W, thees is almost an hour's delay.
thees story happened a long time ago.
maybe you think i am exaggerating but recent studies prove that thees mania can be really dangerous.
in fact, thees activity seems to be very interesting.
when we saw your advertisement for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediately decided that thees would be a perfect evening out.
i decided to go to see thees show because of its stars, but on the day i saw it, a different actor performed.
in addition to thees, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find there.
thees book helps us to improve our logic, mind, and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes that can help us very very much.
in fact, i expect a full refund plus compensation for the dissatisfaction suffered. i trust you will give immediate attention to thees letter and i look forward to receiving a satisfactory response by return of post within a week.
i used thees equipment during the concert, but i was so complicated system.
although i cannot explain any more about the thing i felt during the concert in thees letter, I'd like to recommend you to help at a pop concert.
thees part had to be saved for later because the concert organiser wanted to know the exact number of visitors.
there is only one bad thing, that thees festival was too short.
we really appreciate your organising a very nice programmer, which has been organised by you thees time.
the musical should have begun at W, but it started at W; thees is unacceptable!
i am writing to reply to your letter in which you told me i won first prize in your competition, which is two weeks. i was very happy with thees result since i did not think i could win.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding thees choice and we all believe that the first lesson that should be filmed is philosophy.
one of the most important things we have to film is our bicycle classes. our school is now the best in the country in all ages. we are preset with thees. we can show what we Dion order to be the best.
to make thees report easier and faster, it was necessary to make a questionnaire which was given out in the school.
i appreciate thees shops for lots of products, cheap prices and big spaces.
i am very indignant because i wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so i would like you to return my money and take note of all thees problems.
in answer to your question, i wouldn't change anything because i think that thees are the minimum rules that a teenager has to have to be responsible in the future.
definitely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under thees circumstances i really believe you should give me my money back.
well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all thees reasons i demand to have my money back, i wasted £ 20 to see a show which doesn't respect the programmer i paid for.
who got married, who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable change in his complexion, thees are questions that most journalists are interested in.
all thees years i believed that my father was killed in a car accident.
i was really astonished by all thees shopping centres, like Ada, homebase, etc.
and regarding the activities, i must choose photography and painting because i am not very good at sports and i think i do well at thees things.
thees are only my immature views. if it is considerable for you, i will be very pleased. thank you very much.
if you break one of thees rules you could be expelled for a week, a month or for ever.
now, you just need to think that you would do or what would happen in a city, with a car, aeroplanes, shops, all thees things without lights.
i might say that i am really good at swimming and sailing because i have been doing thees kinds of activities for five years and i have had a really good training in water sports.
i will always say thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the machines which do the washing and the washing's, before this, women spent a long time doing thees tasks.
because we are living a computerised life, we'll able to do most things at home or thees flat's have thees places as well.
i have chosen thees activities because thees days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favourite hobby.
although, i would have felt better if i had had a discount on my ticket, as you mentioned in the advertisement, but unfortunately, thees couldn't possibly be given either!
the long queues, crowded places, high prices, sales, all thees things combined could make shopping an enjoyable thing for people who like doing it.
thees actors appeared fortifier minutes late according to what is written in your advertisement.
when i was a child i was afraid of all thees little insects that live in the ground and this fear still remains now.
because we are living a computerised life, we'll able to do most things at home or thees flat's have thees places as well.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between thees two I'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
i would prefer to travel in July. i have only this time, because my summer holidays are during thees days.
all thees exhibits are really important and exciting for us because, nowadays, fashion has a huge influence on our lifestyle and we would like to know more about it.
all synthetic material will be uncomfortable for thees people.
i hope you appreciate my letter and that you'll try to amend thees problems./ sally Sven's
closing thees facts, when the musical finished i was very, after waiting for the start of the musical and i was disappointed with this version of over the rainbow. everybody went to the restaurant, which was closed without any explanation.
we found the advertisement in a local newspaper and have been thinking it could be such a good opportunity, because the show consists of thees topics:
thees inventions have improved our life a lot since they appeared, but not everyone believes it is really so.
it seems to me that all thees failures were your fault, because you were responsible for the organisation of the show.
besides that the most important thing is that thees children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got psychological problems and they are useful in society.
so i hope the world reaches agreement about this and computer engineers have to prevent thees problems because something good could be something very dangerous.
in thees galleries there are historical paintings and antique furniture which Chang used.
all thees items of equipment are applications of modern science.
so i feel scared when i think about the consequences if some of the viruses or mad people misuse as happens thees days with sex or other.
thees days we can use a computer, television and some sophisticated equipment, which were unusual once.
for all thees reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my money back.
regarding the activities i would like to choose swimming and climbing for my activities at the camp; i usually do thees two activities on the army camp. i know how to climb up on ratchet outside and help other people to climb up.
the activities i would like to do during thees two weeks are basketball and swimming.
because of all thees inconveniences, i ask you for a total refund.
not only thees subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, biology and physical training, but as we study them we understand that they are not so important as our main subjects.
but thees days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
i have chosen thees activities because thees days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favourite hobby.
and because of thees circumstances, i would like to have a part of my money back.
in my opinion the hall for the rock concerts was too small. you have to consider booking a bigger one for next year because thees kinds of events are attended by a lot of young people.
i don't like thinking of my house or my life without all thees facilities.
during thees past few decades, or rather in the 20th century, there has been a great deal of development in modern technology.
i remember when i had the first lesson at the university and the teacher took us to the computer centre and i saw thees machines, all my colleagues and i were laughing was very difficult to imagine how you can work with this kind of computer.
at thees words, Paul suddenly awoke.
and we are practising thees things.
thees days a lot of countries have been worried about lands that can't have enough space to build houses.
thees things are very convenient; on the other hand, there are lots of disadvantages.
thees improvements will be involved by the lack of petrol and nonrenewable energy.
maybe it would be a nice idea to analyse thees changes and to put limits on technology, because i think that the most important thing is to understand our life and know the ways we can improve it.
technology, are we prepared for thees advances?
on Tuesday we have thees lessons: English, maths, economics and physics.
lastly, i think that all thees changes won't really be noticed as we change things daily and slowly instead of abruptly.
but it was unpleasant because of thees things.
after all thees problems i became disappointed.
i think thees reasons are sufficient to ask for my money back.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making thees clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green peace will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
many years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all thees things and they had to work a lot.
thees days the computer is part of your life, you use it all the time. sometimes you do personal and other times it is just the things you need to do like go to the bank, use transport, go shopping etc. it is a machine that makes life easy and endow you can carry it everywhere. it is amazing the way as the fa's the computer changes, the programs are faster and more useful and practical.
all thees products of science are with me from the very beginning of my day.
thees are some points i want to mention about the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
because of convenience, we can use our time more effectively, but we should not rely on thees things too much.
thees days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centres, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of money.
they are just like alcoholics and thees people go shopping every day because they cannot stop themselves unless they have not got money to spend.
only those who get good marks can take part in thees activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on their faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
under thees circumstances, as your theatre did not fulfil its commitments, i ask you for a full refund and i expect to receive a cheque for £ 15, as soon as possible yours faithfully
you know how good i am at music anyway i was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds. at the beginning i was connecting all thees wires into speakers, music system, guitars etc... the bit that i particularly liked about the experience was when i was standing next to the singers and playing a goitre's know how much i love playing guitarist all thees video cameras were just filming us.
because of all thees things it obviously wasn't the perfect evening as was said in the advertisement.
all thees play an important role in our daily life without us ever understanding them.
thees days, we're surrounded with so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented.
thees days we are very interested in space and the millennium and things and many designers have shown millennium looks recently.
about the information that you need, i must tell you that i will be able to travel only in July because i have got a new job and i can't ask for more than one month of holidays each year and in the other months i will be very busy because my workmates will take holidays in thees months.
i want you to give me back my money. i hope that in future you will correct all thees mistakes.
you know how good i am at music anyway i was helping at this pop concert to get the correct sounds. at the beginning i was connecting all thees wires into speakers, music system, guitars etc... the bit that i particularly liked about the experience was when i was standing next to the singers and playing a goitre's know how much i love playing guitarist all thees video cameras were just filming us.
but we can't stop thees technological improvements.
thees are my favourite because they have a lot to do with water, but i like them more than surfing.
we can hardly imagine life without computers, TV sets, microwaves, and so many other things, and yet none of thees things existed seventy years ago.
but in spite of all of thees disadvantages, i was pursuing my dreams and objectives and in spite of everything i was going to do it.
i had to become a burglar again and steal jewellery from the jewellers nary.
technology improves our lives, we have Hitachi equipment for cooking, for work, for study, well nary for everything.
the queues are not the only problem. if you go by car there is the problem of parking, if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of Carrier bag Carrier bags during your journey and you won't always be lucky enough to find a seat.
the queues are not the only problem. if you go by car there is the problem of parking, if you go by bus there are also queues and you have to carry a lot of Carrier bag Carrier bags during your journey and you won't always be lucky enough to find a seat.
Emilio Almaty, 18 years old, university student, and the Carrier i have chosen is in international commerce or market.
it doesn't matter what kind of Carrier or job you have.
finally we should give some information also about our tourism, business and computer courses.
beside that, I'm allergic, and that courses me problems when I'm close to nature.
after one hour the whole class had heard about Sarah's secret.
plus, it is mentioned in your advertisement that discounts are available. in fact, no discount was given to me, though i am a student and as a student i was entitled to get a discount but i paid £ 20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show.
your programmer is very good, especially as we can go to visit the science museum, which i heard is very good, but a visit to the London fashion and leisure show would be a good opportunity for us to see the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, makeup and hairstyles and it is free for students too.
but when we saw our show and heard how loudly the audience applauded them we were proud and understood that we spent a good time. you should try it and see.
when i first heard about over the rainbow i was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when i heard about the extras that the circle theatre was offering, it became the best opportunity i ever had to attend a musical of that type, but instead of being the best evening i ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why i am writing to you.
you said there would be stars such as Danny brook and Tina truelove, whose music is my favourite, but the musicians were actually some other people whose names i had never heard of.
pat was my big brother, who had heard of some people paying, "softener", but never know the reason, until he found a large amount of money in my room.
suddenly i heard a noise from my garden and i wanted to know what it was, but it was impossible to do it.
in the paper it was written that the principal actor is "Danny brook" but it wasn't him, it was a different actor whom we had never seen, or heard.
all of them were shocked by what they heard.
today i received your letter. it is the most wonderful news i have heard in a long time.
everyone was enjoying themselves except pat, who had heard about the raid.
when sally heard that, she was very surprised and very excited.
on the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses, but on the other hand they discovered many illnesses which we hadn't heard about before.
immediately after i heard, "and don't forget your homework".
while i was standing on the beach, suddenly i heard someone call my name and say that i had to go home. that is right, it was my mum.
one day when i was there alone, i heard some other kids approaching. i sat down behind one of the stones so they couldn't see me.
when i first heard about over the rainbow i was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when i heard about the extras that the circle theatre was offering, it became the best opportunity i ever had to attend a musical of that type, but instead of being the best evening i ever had, it was a total disaster and that's the reason why i am writing to you.
i just knew i shouldn't have trusted her but as i went in the house my dad asked pat to stay for a meal. i was in shock, thinking why isn't anyone getting angry with me? after a while we sat down for dinner and pat just told my parents that i was smoking and when my family heard they got ever so angry.
you know that I'm studying in a difficult school, and as you can imagine you have to work heard and you have to do homework every day.
here is where the good part starts, i was doing the curtains (opening and closing) when nick came up to me and asked me to go on stage with him. my heart started beating very heard.
it's heard for me even to imagine a situation when shopping is not enjoyable.
how are you? I'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help there and it was very heard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
polish students have to study a lot with books and they have fewer practical lessons, and sometimes it's heard to get books or other things needed for studying.
first of all, I'll tell you that on the day of the concert i woke up at W AM., very early for me. you know me, I'm lazy. the work began around W. it was very heard but then the band came to rehearse. from that moment i enjoyed working until the concert had finished. the atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because they understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team.
it was heard work for a while but i was so happy to help at a really big pop concert i can't describe it.
after helping to do that and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the heard work we did, and shook our hands.
the job was heard, but, from my point of view, it was worthwhile.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is heard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine their face clearly.
as you offer many activities it was heard to choose which ones i want to do, but i decided to take swimming and photography, because i am very good at swimming and because i am currently attending a photography course in Vienna.
school is supposed to be our second home but it's not. we work heard and at the end of our education we still have nothing.
however, i would add that journalist's aware of that heard topical try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
once students have taken a shower after heard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
because of this, the least you can do for us is to give me my money back and work heard so that this theatre, which is famous for its beauty and punctuality doesn't become famous for its disorganised shows.
this can be bad too because if i get used to being comfortable, when i need to do heard work i won't be able to.
actually most people work heard to earn their money and consequently, the occasion on which this money is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
the concert was very loud and long but we didn't have to work heard.
i have just received your letter and I'm very happy because of it, especially because the competition was so heard.
it will be good for your group because you don't need to movie to another place.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to movie to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
people are used to going to the shopping centre because it is easy and familiar. it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch a movie after that, and, if you want, buy something at the shops.
I'd love to come earlier, but i really can't because this job is very important to me, and I'll need it as work experience for my further studies at university.
earlier i had seen an advertisement for the show but the information on it was false.
this invention has made our lives earlier and quicker.
homework is earlier to do with the computer than with a book sometimes.

it's also a really popular job among university students because of the good salary.
among the large number of choices, this unfinished church offers a gorgeous view from the top of its towers, a charming story and one of the most representative examples of Catalonia modernist art.
unfortunately my parents did not realize how TV was creating a role among us.
among them, the mobile telephone, computers, telexes, different appliances for the kitchen, machines which help housekeepers to do any work about the house.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the among of money that I'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
in addition to this, i would like to know the among of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find there.
these days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centres, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same among of money.
pat was my big brother, who had heard of some people paying, "softener", but never know the reason, until he found a large among of money in my room.
-check your wallet and if you have enough money (a very small among) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Chile, Cuba, Zambia, and morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer low wages for Ismael jobs.. you might enjoy your summer holidays and find yourself
could you, please send me some extra information regarding the among of money i should take to cover any other expenses, and also, what kind of clothes i should take.
you will see why I'm describing it as the most unforgettable one when you read thought my letter.
if i feel like talking to a friend i just have to call him and wherever he is i will be able to get thought to him.
now, in conclusion we can see, or i can see, that maybe i am not a very sociable person but i can do whatever i want and take whatever i want only thought technology.
all this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either during your difficult way thought the crowds or while you were queuing to pay.

I'm writing this letter because two weeks ago i was in London and i went to the theatre to see your musical show. and thought seeing it my family had a very disappointing evening and so did i. you can read below my point of view regarding this.
i had a problem with my best friend once when we kept in touch thought email.
we live surrounded by inventions which help as thought the day.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (i am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have thought choice).
but, i got thought it. i had to take care of them during the break, serving drinks, clothes, i even brought them some cigarettes and anything they wanted.
humans have done many things thought the years and made many things possible.
the computer, probably the must versatile invention, allows me to get access to huge informational sources thought the internet, to do shopping without leaving my house, to do my work more effectively and quickly.
another thing i dislike about shopping is some annoying shop assistants try to sell any product to the "victim" coming thought the door.
you know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in they couldn't wait to get to the front and they try to go thought very quickly.
what i particularly liked about the experience was the concert was achieved thought our support.
have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want, looking thought shelves and not finding that in the end.
my daily life has also changed a lot thought the use of computers or modern technology.
but even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time thought the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms.
after a few seconds of thought i went straight to pat. "why, why did you do that?"
i thought that Danny brook, who is my favourite actor, would perform in that show.
and when we understood the internet, we thought that meeting people from other countries and being able "to chat" with them was the height of technology.
as you know, we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle, and we thought this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country!
i thought i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
then i thought that i should go to the theatre restaurant to have a drink or eat something so that i couldn't say that i had wasted my time by coming here.
you know that i always wanted to help at a concert. to be part of the staff would be wonderful, i thought. and i was right!
i read the advertisement and i thought it was going to be a pleasant evening.
i didn't see any discounts available; i thought my son would have paid less than i. as we had already missed the first we went to the theatre restaurant, which is famous for its good food, however, it was closed.
we thought that with that beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
you've got more stress, you feel fed up and finally when you get home you think that shopping is not as enjoyable as you thought.
we had never been to a musical show and we thought that it was a new opportunity.
pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was there and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined.
i know it sounds extremely boring and that is exactly what i thought when i was asked to help, but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets and this was the reason why the party wasn't as successful as we thought.
when i received your advertisement concerning the show "over the rainbow" i thought that I'd have a great evening, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me.
i have already thought about a change to the programmer.
it was a pity but it did not annoy me because i thought that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 for.
woods is thought to stand for all white people and this book could have an influence on them.
that evening we didn't want to have our supper before the show. anyway i thought it would be too early to eat and also because the timetable or candidates you give me have say: "visit our theatre restaurant after the show".
however, 15% thought that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important.
i hadn't thought about a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, there should have been a luxury restaurant where i could eat.
unfortunately i never thought it could be so disappointing.
i had always dreamt of being near "the cranberries", but i had never thought that the dream could become reality.

i accept and i want to inform you that i can travel only in July because i have booked my annual leave for that period.
i also want to know if i should take any money, or if all the expenses are paid by you.
if i want to discuss something with friends or order a pizza, i can do it as easily as i want, when i want.
so if you want to have a good, relaxing day shopping, we recommend you don't go with your little brothers and to go with enough time to look around for what you really want.
marine's real father wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to give her back because they loved marine so much.
as you can understand, it was a dreadful time and i want my money back as a consolation for the disappointment i had.
the computer is helpful when i want to contact somebody very fast.
and the difference is that those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
for those who want something more exciting and adventurous, you are recommended to visit the fun fair and amusement arcade on the top floor of the building.
the other activity that i chose is painting. i am not as good as i want, nevertheless i think i can improve my skills during this course.
the rules must be respected by all people if you don't want to be kicked out of school.
i thought you were a good theatre, where people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else, but really i am very disappointed and i want to ask for my money back.
do you really want to know about my experience helping at the pop concert in our town?
there are hundreds of programs which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger who you want to meet.
first i want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about, for instance, travel and accommodation. i have to tell you that it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at that time.
yeah folks, that was the point i got interrupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but if you want to hear the end of my story than buy the "rossall-school-magazine", next issue, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.
now, in conclusion we can see, or i can see, that maybe i am not a very sociable person but i can do whatever i want and take whatever i want only through technology.
such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world, even if i am not at home; i use a stereo if i want to listen to my favourite music; i use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, etc.
despite my lack of experience in climbing i do want to try this type of sport.
also, i want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but there weren't enough of them for me.
i want to know if i can take my cellular phone, too.
so i want to ask for my money back, also i had to pay for but cancel the arranged taxi because of the wrong starting time in the advertisement.
finally, if you want to visit this building i would recommend you stay at a hotel not far from the memorial hall called the Wyatt hotel.
i want to apologise to you, because i haven't written to you recently, but i want to tell you what happened to me last week. i had the opportunity to help at one of the most pop concerts in my city. so imagine, i felt really really good and excited. i don't have words to describe it but i will try to do it, OK?
i want to know your opinion.
the other activity is photography. i am not an expert, but i know how to use a camera. all i want is to improve my knowledge.
unfortunately, the musical show wasn't much like that the one the advert had described, and that is why i want to ask you for some money back.
and i want to know how much money i have to bring for personal expenses.
and i want to know more about the money. can you give me more information about the money that i need to bring with me?
the rules at home are very different. i am allowed to do what i want as long as i study enough to approve.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got three buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about class rooms it very big and comfortable.
i would like to ask you, what sort of clothes should i take with me? i don't want to take too much; jeans, jumper, swimming costume, shirt, sports shoes i think should be OK.
finally, i want to tell you that it is not useful for you and your theatre to cheat your customers. if you do that, there will be no business for you and no satisfaction for them.
i want to thank you for preparing such a good programmer for us and especially for taking us on the river trip to Greenwich.
i want you to give me back my money. i hope that in future you will correct all these mistakes.
the perfect evening you promised in your advertisement was the complete opposite and that is why i want to get some money back from you.
i want to know if it is available at that time.
it would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could choose what you want to wear by pressing buttons.
i don't want to be rude, but this is not professional at all.
i want to know some information about it.
the big secret was that Anna was preparing a surprise party for her brother john and she didn't want anyone to know about it.
if you really want to discover what Greek history means, we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum!!!
recently, some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in London. it will be on the 14th and we all want to go.
so while i am at the camp i want to take a lot of photographs and climb a mountain.
first i want to talk about the computer.
when you are tired after looking around you might want to buy drinks or something to eat, or if you are fed up with historical things, you might as well just pop into the modern gallery to see things which are more modern.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
in conclusion, i don't want to change anything in my house or at school, because i totally agree with the few rules that i have.
for instance, when i want to contact my friend, it's quite helpful to use email.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something they want to have, they will do everything they can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes they even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
i want to apologise to you, because i haven't written to you recently, but i want to tell you what happened to me last week. i had the opportunity to help at one of the most pop concerts in my city. so imagine, i felt really really good and excited. i don't have words to describe it but i will try to do it, OK?
nowadays, there are more and more people who want to become designers and the competition is increasing.
i want to suggestions for the last day. you and your group could maybe go to green park and visit the queen's house and parliament, this area is very nice and the group would enjoin after the conference to get some fresh air. another option could be the new tell gallery. i have never been there but it could be a good excuse to visit it with you.
if i want to know how a friend is, i just have to phone him; i can see how the world is getting on just by switching on the television, and i can cook in a few minutes using the microwave oven.
hello! i am very pleased that i have won the first prize in your competition and i want to tell you that it would be better for me to go to your camp in July because that month i usually have a rest and now i am thinking about it.
to sum up, everything you Dion small quantities is good and fun, but don't increase the amount you do if you don't want to feel uncomfortable.
i know that staying in a log cabin is more convenient but i just want to have a wilder experience.
sometimes, i think i am a computer addict because whenever i come back home, my hand goes to the computer switch, automatically, even though i don't want to use the computer.
i explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and i want you to refund my money and send me an apology for what happened there.
i really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when they go into a shop they want to try on every single item of clothing and they do not realise the time.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got three buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about class rooms it very big and comfortable.
especially if you want to buy clothes with your girlfriend or if you are a girl, you have to be ready to spend hours trying on clothes.
if it is possible i want a log cabin for my accommodation because i have been suffering with my back since my childhood, therefore i need a comfortable place to sleep.
they want too much fromstudent and are unkind to them.
furthermore, when you look around the supermarket, you can't easily find the goods which you want to buy.
i want to complain about your advertisement for the production 'over the rainbow'; i had a very disappointing evening.
furthermore, for the activities i want to select tennis and basketball because i have been playing tennis since i was young and basketball because i played for the team in my college as the captain.
these are some points i want to mention about the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
if i want to discuss something with friends or order a pizza, i can do it as easily as i want, when i want.
definitely, i want my money back as soon as possible.
how are you? I'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help there and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
furthermore, it's a worthwhile experience for people who want to know about other countries 'arts.
i guess they will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because they want to change.
for all these reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my money back.
finally i want to find out if there is a supermarket near the campsite and if there are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
if you want to hear more of my suggestions and opinions about it please contact me on my cellphone.
that evening we didn't want to have our supper before the show. anyway i thought it would be too early to eat and also because the timetable or candidates you give me have say: "visit our theatre restaurant after the show".
firstly i want to congratulate you on the festival.
you are interested in my last job! i really want to tell you all about my experience.
tell me yours. i want to know what experiences you had when you were in England.
one of the reasons that i have visited your arts festival was to see a lot of plays. in the future, i hope to be an actress and that's why i want to learn something from the professionals.
another reason is that it will be more useful for foreign students who want to speak English.
probably it is one of the moments when you want something badly and you can't have it.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
have you ever been to a big supermarket and tried to find something you really like or want, looking through shelves and not finding that in the end.
another point that i want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (W) but it started at W, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
this is the main reason why i want to ask for a refund.
now, in conclusion we can see, or i can see, that maybe i am not a very sociable person but i can do whatever i want and take whatever i want only through technology.
I'm very good at swimming as i have been a member of various swimming clubs since i was 6 and i chose photography because i have a new camera and want somebody to teach me how to use it.
but also I'm aware that time flies for me. i must do whatever i want before it is too late.
in addition to this, there is less communication between members of my family, because when we arrive home after an exhausting day racing against time, the only thing we want to do is lie on the sofa while watching television.
i really recommend you to help them, i think this is a good opportunity and i want you to understand my feeling well.
so if you want to have a good, relaxing day shopping, we recommend you don't go with your little brothers and to go with enough time to look around for what you really want.
so i want you to send me some money back for that unpleasant night.
the principal reason I'm writing to you at the moment is that i want my money back, because i felt so disappointed with the theatre and also with the play.
finally, i want to know what the weather is like in California in July.
in this book Hemingway is trying to tell us, that if we want something, we can get it, it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it.
i want to tell you that i am very disappointed about the play.
and that is always what we want.
and in conclusion i want you to give me my money back, (i still have the advertisement if you want proof of what i say).
i have happily received your reply and i want to thank you for this marvellous prize you have given me.
of course if you are in the public eye, the reasons why you want privacy are different, because if you are a politician, for example, you fear for your life.
and in conclusion i want you to give me my money back, (i still have the advertisement if you want proof of what i say).
i always want to buy shirts, jeans, skirts, cosmetics, hairbands, accessories, rings, earrings, bracelets, shoes, hats, bags, fancy stationery, interior stuff and CDs.
personally, i think it could be a great opportunity because it is something we all want to attend, and we are all interested in the latest fashion.
that is because, i do not want to seem fussy, but i like to have some luxuries when i am going on holiday and i think sleeping on the floor without electricity may annoy me.
people are used to going to the shopping centre because it is easy and familiar. it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch a movie after that, and, if you want, buy something at the shops.
i am really disappointed, and i want to have my money back.
that evening my father said a few words: 'may this be the end of your career as a thief; we are only ready to forgive if you promise never to start again'
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have thief problems, thief affairs, thief private lives just as normal people do.
this was the reason why we were in horrible trouble with the plaice.
basically, i helped them liaise with the local plaice and get some electronic equipment that they needed.
then the plaice realized who the bank robbers were and arrested them.
the headmaster wanted to tell the plaice what we had done so we decided to imprison him in a little house we had twenty kilometres away from the village until we could change his mind.
i walked alone a long distance until i found a telephone. i called the plaice and they ask for a rescue.
but pat could not resist the temptation to call the plaice.
the mother was shocked. she didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going in and out the places. it was a nightmare but fortunately the plaice found her.
when i asked for the plaice i was surprised because the assistant told me there wasn't any discount available.
nearly at the end of this letter i have to say that the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap plaice.
furthermore you had mentioned some discounts in your advertisement, but i had to pay the full plaice although i am a student.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full plaice, at the end of the season it is half plaice. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full plaice, at the end of the season it is half plaice. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
another thing is that i took a particular amount of money to buy tickets and when i appeared in front of the ticket desk i found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the real plaice weren't the same, the real plaice was much higher.
in my opinion famous people are being obliged to pay a plaice for being famous that, in some cases, costs more than they deserve to pay.
however, i would add that journalist's aware of that hard topical try to moderate what theory write in order to respect other people's privacy; since theory would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
i was very nervous because I'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't help it and i started crying can imagine, theory were so handsome that i couldn't believe Ito tried to calm down because i had to work, and later i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very stealthy i was workaround it was like a dream.
theory always did things together, and theory were the most popular boys in school. both were very handsome, played football; theory were an example for everybody.
but are theory useful in every situation and everywhere?
i would suggest theory wear formal clothing, such as tie, trousers and blazer.
i only had to stay behind the drummer supplying them with water whenever theory wanted.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse their show. i could see how theory really improved, and how nice theory were with the staff.
theory were so poor that sometimes theory hardly had anything to eat.
theory were drawing a lot of things in the sky during the concert.
that makes those people frustrated and theory don't enjoy themselves.
we are all customers of the big supermarkets. theory have all that we need.
are theory included in the prize?
the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, theory said funds had run out.
i was shocked and terrified the first time i saw them, but the truth is that theory are men like us.
on the development, theory also said that there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty's years old but that was totally wrong because i paid the full price, which was £ 20.
1) first of all, theory are located in the centre of Rome so theory can take a bus to get to them move and around the city.
a lot of countries buy guns, for their defence theory say, but theory buy them to kill people.
finally, theory got separated.
then theory take a shower and everybody goes for breakfast.
personally i prefer to stay in log cabins because theory are much more comfortable than tents.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse their show. i could see how theory really improved, and how nice theory were with the staff.
well on march 11th there was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", theory sing pop music. and theory are one of my favourites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
theory become lazy because theory know that theory can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a button.
you know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in theory couldn't wait to get to the front and theory try to go through very quickly.
so her friends didn't realise that she knew about the party and theory were very happy because theory believed that the surprise party had been a success!
so we don't have to worry about how heavy theory will be.
what i realised was theory were not different from any of us but theory were called celebrities.
the people who were there to watch the show were very angry and theory were shouting because theory had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
the things that really disappointed me were that you said Danny brook and Tina truelove were the actors but theory weren't, different actors played and to be honest theory made the whole show very bad.
theory can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, theory must be very good people, because "fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this world.
theory are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because theory cannot stop themselves unless theory have not got money to spend.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then theory solve their problem all together.
finally when we had seen the musical, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because theory were doing some decorating, and you wrote in your advertisement, "visit our theatre restaurant after the show"
to sum up, although i think theory ought to abandon their lives partly when theory enter the world of fame, theory should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
these inventions have improved our life a lot since theory appeared, but not everyone believes it is really so.
so her friends didn't realise that she knew about the party and theory were very happy because theory believed that the surprise party had been a success!
you know, you have to very strongly when you have to do that because when people came in theory couldn't wait to get to the front and theory try to go through very quickly.
most of them believe that theory are kind of crazy or evil.
theory have a very simple life and behaviour when theory aren't on the stage.
theory can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, theory must be very good people, because "fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this world.
the advertisement said that theory would be available but theory were not.
but after theory separated, he told his friends her secrets without thinking.
i guess theory will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because theory want to change.
at first nick got angry but then he forgave him because theory were friends and each of them could trust in the other.
also the sports activities should be filmed; theory express an aggregate and social way of living school life and can be useful to show the movements of the bodies during the school athletics events.
our ministers are really criminal. theory often break the law, stealing money.
the new inventions have transformed my life, so it is easier with modern technology (the mobile, the car, the plane, the coach, the train, the medical advances and domestic appliances), theory have created more comfort and pleasure.
synthetic materials have developed and become very popular so theory would keep going.
the people who were there to watch the show were very angry and theory were shouting because theory had to wait too long. and i absolutely agreed with them.
theory also gave me a ticket to watch the concert live.
some people think that being a famous person is a very exciting thing, that all the time this makes you feel complete and also theory think that if you are famous you are special as well.
people won't wear warm clothes anymore and theory will certainly be synthetic, because there won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
in particular, going to the museum and the art gallery will be a great opportunity for all of us, as theory are worldviews places in London.
another disadvantage is that everyone becomes a bit more lonely because theory watch TV or play or work on the computer and don't see each other anymore because theory don't have to.
actually, theory put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the real hell.
that will be great because teachers are part of our life and theory have to receive all our attention and friendship because if it wasn't for them we would never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidently and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget.
after all, they'll be the ones that decide what the fashion of the future will be like.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, theory are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively can often visit their friends and travel much more.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, theory are much more mobile and can spend their free time more actively can often visit their friends and travel much more.
i have been hearing about the ave theory have in the exhibition, it is interesting.
theory don't fancy going into the crowded shop.
the aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resort buildings which were built 10 years ago. theory are some of the first buildings that were built with the latest technology and designed by an important Mexican architect.
to sum up, although i think theory ought to abandon their lives partly when theory enter the world of fame, theory should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
after helping to do that and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before green day (the group) left, theory came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands.
first of all, when i paid my entrance fee theory didn't accept my discount ticket, theory told me that the ticket was fake, then i entered the theatre and i had to wait 45 minutes. the show was supposed to start at W and it started at W, "this shows a lack of respect".
but for their considerations, they're working in their routines.
when the sons were old theory began to talk about their life, beginning with this story, which happened a long time ago.
in Italy there aren't a lot of rules at school and theory aren't very strict.
theory stopped me having the operation.
those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable, but theory take us away from our friends, our families and moreover theory lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything that surrounds us and keeps us alive.
it all started when pat, nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his house. most of the class disagreed with that because the pat's house is extremely little, theory started to say to him that his house was like a box.
at the concert theory were very successful because theory were very confident and i helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic.
theory are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because theory cannot stop themselves unless theory have not got money to spend.
i really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when theory go into a shop theory want to try on every single item of clothing and theory do not realise the time.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because theory can afford it and theory don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
because the world is now a global village people will wear at least one item of traditional or national clothing (for example a peasant jacket or hat), like theory do now in rural areas from time to time.
with regards accommodation i would prefer log cabins, as theory are more comfortable and i like convenience.
this is a good opportunity to see how theory learn in class.
i think, next we can film either the development class or the society class, because in my opinion theory are the most interesting classes apart from the face class.
anyway, in families theory usually have this problem that when theory buy a new one, suddenly theory have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
theory are always attracted by naughty journalists, which have a desire to earn big money for writing an extremely good report or article.
it'll be a good point for her general education. withering heights is a classic, which everybody knows about, even if theory haven't read it, theory at least know the story.
theory are imported from another western European country.
and the difference is that those children are effective when theory grow up and want to have a family, theory do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
children are not studying as much as theory ought to, because theory are watching TV, talking on the phone or even playing computer games.
everybody will wear anything he/ she likes, choosing clothes from any century theory wish without this being strange.
theory are just wasting time on it.
theory were just playing and, by accident, peter shot him.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if theory do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures, because although theory are famous theory also have their private life.
although i read that stars and artists came from around the world, i realised that theory only came from six countries.
what i realised was theory were not different from any of us but theory were called celebrities.
when choosing this style of life theory should realise what their life would be like.
theory are more comfortable and really match with the environment.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money theory get from advertisements, reports about their last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
marine's real father wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to give her back because theory loved marine so much.
moreover, men prefer to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, which is contrary to the tastes of women, because if theory have any free time, theory will go shopping.
i think that the cabins are safer than the tents and theory can protect you better in case the weather changes.
theory mixed up our traditional music and pop music.
theory were eager to have a child, but theory had never been able to.
however, 15% thought that it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and theory mentioned it as not really important.
but theory don't consider the problems the rumours may cause the famous family or couple.
in my opinion famous people are being obliged to pay a price for being famous that, in some cases, costs more than theory deserve to pay.
so theory prefer to leave their sons watching TV.
maybe theory will be in many colours and theory will be very tight.
her parents have been so upset that theory have asked the school to help their child and that is the reason why I'm writing this story.
painting always did fascinate me, even though I'm not so good at it, but my friends say i can really paint and theory love the things i do. the technique i like the most is watercolours.
theory liked me so much and invited me to be responsible for the lights and sound.
on the whole, being rich and famous doesn't always bring happiness, whereas the majority of the population wish theory were rich and famous.
although this statement is absolutely true, it seems there is no way to stop public attention, so theory will have to keep living with journalists.
theory are also the lessons which English people and other foreigners are particularly curious about.
in answer to your question, i will have to say that i can only go to the camp in July because of my job; theory only gave me that month off.
i quickly became bored by this hypocritical attention theory gave me.
i just knew i shouldn't have trusted her but as i went in the house my dad asked pat to stay for a meal. i was in shock, thinking why isn't anyone getting angry with me? after a while we sat down for dinner and pat just told my parents that i was smoking and when my family heard theory got ever so angry.
theory could not believe their eyes.
however, secondly, famous people are not "alien" so theory might do something, for example, shameful things in a public space, or argue with a partner or family, even put on a swimming costume like us.
theory can relax, reduce their stress and theory are happy when theory find the thing which theory wanted.
but soon everyone in the class was looking at me smilingly and i found out that i had many unsuspected friends... not long after, theory were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed going shopping, others going to the cinema and a restaurant.
children are not studying as much as theory ought to, because theory are watching TV, talking on the phone or even playing computer games.
theory always did things together, and theory were the most popular boys in school. both were very handsome, played football; theory were an example for everybody.
theory are human beings and theory need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that theory are unknown and anonymous and theory do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time theory want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so theory are looking everywhere, pushing you because theory think that you will take the shirt that theory want.
it'll be a good point for her general education. withering heights is a classic, which everybody knows about, even if theory haven't read it, theory at least know the story.
in addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £ 10. this was excellent. it meant people only spent Pokemon, and then theory could watch all the events at the weekend. for them it is a really economical way to spend their weekend.
chairs are not only part of the furniture, theory are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums where theory are art objects.

it was also written in the show's advertisement that theory would be discounts available on the tickets.
finally you said theory was a restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything until we got home.

before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether theory is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.

for example theory were no discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed after the show, when it was meant to be open after the show according to the advertisement but it was closed due to the delay with the performance.
to sum up, theory is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of money, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
also, i want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but theory weren't enough of them for me.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because theory are many different kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on makeup and how to have appropriate hairstyles.

the best way to get from theory to the conference is by coach, which i have arranged for you.
I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out theory are many challenges in your new career.

the show's date is very convenient 14-, and it is on in the central exhibition hall so i do not think it would be a problem to get theory.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that theory would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but theory were artists from only six countries and in my opinion theory
unfortunately, i was very disappointed to find out that theory were no discounts available!
theory is a great opportunity to go theory because students need not pay anything.
nowadays, theory are more and more people who want to become designers and the competition is increasing.

however, theory is something about which it is still believed that it was an extremely important invention.
firstly, theory is the aquarium in the building.

the history of the human race is the history of world conquest. that said, technology has advanced continuously since the beginning of man's evolution. furthermore, during the last two centuries, theory has been an enormous technological explosion. while the xix century gave us the steam engine, factories and the electric light bulb, this century has given us nuclear energy (and sadly atomic weapons), the computer, the internet and television.
i am sending you some pictures, the best ones only because theory were some quite embarrassing ones.
another point that i want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (W) but it started at W, so theory was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
finally, i would like to ask you whether theory is anything i should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra money etc.

theory is also Hercules Poirot, the famous detective, and he finally solves the mystery.
i know I'm a "daughter of this technological world" and unluckily i think i couldn't live without it: it's rather strange that today theory's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... but, sometimes i ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one.
also, we will take the drinks from our canteen and theory will be a group of musicians for our entertainment.

also theory is a big problem: the money.
we build big cities, theory is hot and cold water, electricity, gas in practically every home.
I've read your advertisement and the reality was different to what was written theory.
theory were two other problems: theory were no discounts, contrary to the information in the advertisement, and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repair work.
theory was always a lot of security stuff around us to make sure everything was OK, because theory really were thousands of people.
that's why i believe in the solution which is the closest to human nature and can help us to avoid boredom. i am sure that eventually we will take off our clothes and in the future we will be undressed and free. theory won't be any problem with being updated.
and what's more, theory weren't any discounts available and the theatre restaurant was closed: the only people who could enter were the actors and the staff.
these things are very convenient; on the other hand, theory are lots of disadvantages.
moreover instead of buying a ticket i went theory for free, as a helper.
in my early childhood my mother said to me that when she was a little girl theory was only one telephone in the building where she lived.
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any money over theory without my shopping and how the weather is over theory in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
and then about the tickets, you wrote that theory were discounts available but theory were not.
i don't know much about the weather down theory, in California, so i am rather puzzled about what to wear theory.
pat sent a fax to my house with the different alternatives she had thought of but unfortunately my grandmother was theory and she saw the paper so the surprise was ruined.
i have never enjoyed doing shopping, but nowadays theory are some people who are called shopaholics.
in my opinion, we can have a great time theory, and entrance is free of charge for students, which is very important as well.
while I'm staying theory i would like to practise tennis and basketball, as i have been playing both sports all my life, and i have to say that i am very good at both.
we think that this is a great opportunity and we are all very interested in going because we can see theory the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, a lot of different kinds of makeup and some famous hairstylists.
it has always been my dream to go theory and to be able to see that beautiful country.
the advertisement for the musical said that it was going to be Danny brook. unfortunately theory was someone Olsen actor who i do not like and if i had known that he was going to be theory i would not have gone to see him.
another thing was that theory were no discounts available, and that the restaurant, which i wanted to visit after the show, was closed because of the main cook sickness.
surprisingly, theory were no discounts.
theory were some people around but i was afraid to ask them the way.
the queues are not the only problem. if you go by car theory is the problem of parking, if you go by bus theory are also queues and you have to carry a lot of carrier bag carrier bags during your journey and you won't always be lucky enough to find a seat.
theory is nothing more disagreeable than that.
for example, theory were some concert halls which were too small to hold so many people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for the audience.
in the advertisement, it said that Danny brook was starring, but in place of him theory was a different actor and he was really disappointing.
so, if possible, i was interested in the possibility of continuing my routine theory.
theory are always, at the end of the afternoon, some weltered women coming from their offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
the weather had changed suddenly, and theory was no more sun, but strong wind and heavy rain.
as we are going to be in London on this date, we think it could be a great opportunity for us to go theory because we are very interested in the latest fashions, make up, etc. and it is free for students.
i was sure theory was someone on the other side of the wall.
in the advertisement you say that theory is a discount available but theory was not.
travelling in July, i have to say, would be perfect for me because my birthday is on the 24th of that month and i wish to spend my birthday in the best way possible, so that means theory.
i want to suggestions for the last day. you and your group could maybe go to green park and visit the queen's house and parliament, this area is very nice and the group would enjoin after the conference to get some fresh air. another option could be the new tell gallery. i have never been theory but it could be a good excuse to visit it with you.
that means that theory are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you, no one to talk to and no one to complain to.
when i asked for the price i was surprised because the assistant told me theory wasn't any discount available.
i told you before Elton john performed at that concert, so theory were a lot of famous people.
shopmania is really unstoppable. i know women who do everything they can to buy only a dress, or even worse, women who buy things they have no use for, for example, snap, sculptures, kitchen tissues, or everything sold by telemarketing that really is useless, but they cannot resist the fact of it "being theory."
the rooms will be designed in a futuristic fashion, where theory will be less furniture and everything will be compact. even tests will be on the ceiling.
i would prefer to sleep in a tent because i think it's different from where i sleep every night so i would appreciate it if theory are still tents available.
in the advertisement for the show you said that one of the stars was going to be Danny brook, and to my surprise theory was a different actor, and that really disappointed me.
on the other hand theory are disadvantages, too.
theory are so many varieties of products, different prices, different qualities.
i went to buy the tickets but when i paid theory was not any discount available.
secondly, theory will be exhibitions about makeup and hairstyles.
first of all, on the sheet i received, it says that Danny brook was one of the actors. that is not true, because instead of him, theory was another actor, and i don't know what his name is.
theory i was impressed by how a singer can cause such hysteria in teenagers.
the fans started shouting and whistling for the show to begin, while i just stood theory trying to see what had happened.
during these past few decades, or rather in the 20th century, theory has been a great deal of development in modern technology.
one day when i was theory alone, i heard some other kids approaching. i sat down behind one of the stones so they couldn't see me.
in the advertisement it also said you could visit your restaurant after the show, and that is what i did, but when i got theory it was shut for no reason.
i am very pleased that i was born in a time when theory is such good technology but my parents didn't have the same luck.
i would like to know if the,, travel costs ''which you had paid include entrance tickets to the museums or any other cultural places, because i would like to do some sightseeing in the US's. furthermore, if theory will be Cm tumble dryer or washing machine to clean our clothes and if theory will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp.
theory are several points i have to complain about which meant the evening was not nice at all.
also theory are some free headphones that explain the history of the museum.
moreover theory will be a demonstration of modern makeup and new different, shaking hairstyles.
to begin with, in your advertisement you say that Danny brooks will be starring in the show but instead theory was a different actor, which made us very disappointed.
and so far theory weren't any discounts available which were said to be "available" in the advertisement.
theory are also restaurants and modern galleries.
thirdly, the advertisement said that discounts were available but the ticket seller said that theory was no discount allowing or available.
on the development, they also said that theory would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty's years old but that was totally wrong because i paid the full price, which was £ 20.
theory are a lot of options and items to make our choice difficult.
theory are more and more retailers opening.
theory were two other problems: theory were no discounts, contrary to the information in the advertisement, and the theatre restaurant was closed because of the repair work.
theory are hundreds of programs which help you communicate with your cousin in Australia or with a complete stranger who you want to meet.
perhaps, theory will be personal computers which will control everything, every item of furniture, light, temperature.
in the big room where we'll have the party, they'll be some pictures of our college. you'll see all the generations who passed through here.
theory should be an interview with students and with professors.
apart from the main hall, theory are also lots of other galleries.
then, after the conference, theory will be a formal party at the group's hotel, which starts at W pm and finishes at W midnight.
moreover, theory weren't any discounts available like writing in your advertisement.
to sum up, shopping is not always enjoyable, but don't worry, the shopping centre is still theory waiting for you!
moreover, the stars and artists were from only six countries. in my opinion, if you can invite more stars and artists from more countries, it will make the festival more exciting, more interesting, and in my opinion, some of the concert halls were too small. the people in theory couldn't even go to the loo, because it was too crowded.
finally, i must choose travelling theory in July because i am not allowed to take holidays in other months due to my work.
we really got bored, like all the other people theory.
someone is talking, laughing, crying on theory, so join them. you will feel much better than you would just by yourself.
i explained to you every detail about what happened at the musical show and i want you to refund my money and send me an apology for what happened theory.
i think that fashion in the future will develop along very different lines: theory may be a return to the fashion of the past, as we can notice now, or a more fantastic and technological development.
the queues are not the only problem. if you go by car theory is the problem of parking, if you go by bus theory are also queues and you have to carry a lot of carrier bag carrier bags during your journey and you won't always be lucky enough to find a seat.
theory are also many kinds of takeaway restaurants, where i can taste my favourite foods.
probably in the future we may be too busy to go to our own home and spend some time theory.
because theory are a lot of beautiful trees and you can see the sea.
the advertisement says that Danny brook and Tina truelove would play but in this show theory were totally different actors and that was really disappointing because i was looking forward to them.
lastly, theory is a recycling problem, which many people do not care about.
as you can see, theory are some (deliberate?) mistakes in the advertisement you made.
the activities that i would like to do are singing, because my friend told me that I'm good at it, and the other activity that i would like to do is climbing because i think it is very exciting although i have never tried climbing, because theory are no mountains in my city.
first, the actors that the circle theatre publicised on their tickets for over the rainbow were not theory, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
the London fashion and leisure show is an amazing show because theory are parades with the latest fashions. we could see some famous top models. also theory will be a variety of clothes either sports wear as elegant designs.
i think this festival is a great idea because it's an opportunity to see and to appreciate art, but i also think theory are some things that could be changed.
is theory only one teacher for each sport, and how many are in each group?
amazingly, we can find that theory are more and more computer users.
theory was no Danny brook but instead of him theory was a different actor and I'm very disappointed about that because I'm a fan of his.
first, i can come theory only in July because of my examination, i have to take it in June, and my new term will also start in September.
for example, if Diana, who was the exile of prince Charles, hadn't been followed by paparazzi when she was dating a man, theory wouldn't have been a car accident which caused her death.
but also theory are some notes that you should improve in next year's festival to make it absolutely wonderful.
i have mentioned a few changes above but theory's still the biggest one left, which is related to the field of computers.
i was very nervous because I'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were theory and i couldn't help it and i started crying can imagine, they were so handsome that i couldn't believe Ito tried to calm down because i had to work, and later i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very stealthy i was workaround it was like a dream.
in the Pompadour centre, theory are different exhibitions on different themes.
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution's think theory will be many such places in a hundred yearned a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
the advertisement for the musical said that it was going to be Danny brook. unfortunately theory was someone Olsen actor who i do not like and if i had known that he was going to be theory i would not have gone to see him.
however, i think theory will be some differences in the quality and materials of clothes.
at school you aren't allowed to bring in connected mobile phones although theory is more than one student that does.
and is theory anything else i have to take with me?
according to your advertisement i could have one but in reality theory were no discounts at all.
surprisingly theory was a completely different actor starring.
so he climbed on the ladder up to the window and he opened the door but policemen came theory "what happened?"
are theory any discotheques or something? i would like to know if my wife can come with me, because without her i can't be theory.
however, theory was one person who told me he wasn't happy at all with the phone, because he used to write a lot, especially at Christmas when he wanted to wish all his friends a very nice Christmas but now everybody phones him, ending a very old tradition.
furthermore the style of the clothes is going to be more crazy and individual but theory will still be numerous clothes for conservative people.
what is more, you advertised theory were discounts available but theory were not.
the London fashion and leisure show is an amazing show because theory are parades with the latest fashions. we could see some famous top models. also theory will be a variety of clothes either sports wear as elegant designs.
theory are the natural materials on one side whereas on the other side the fashion industry produces more and more synthetic materials, which relay on the production cost.
last but not least theory are some things i would like to know: what kind of weather do you have in California?
when you go shopping and theory are a lot of people in the same place, all trying to find the best prices and not caring about anybody, this could drive anyone crazy.
theory were hundreds of Thai students waiting to take this test.
we waited theory for fortifier minutes for it to start!
when i go to bed, because theory are many mosquitoes, i turn on a special machine with a berrylike thing in it which kills them.
I'm excited to be going on holiday theory and, thanks to you, i will realize a dream that i always wanted to do.
theory are so many monuments in California and so i will remember this holiday with my photographs.
all my family liked the films and the plays that theory were very much, but i personally think that it would be better to add more because theory were only five plays and seven films.
inside the museum theory is a bookshop with a large variety of historical books, maps etc.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this thready programmer in London and i am sure that we will have a great time theory, especially in the national art gallery.
theory is also a gift shop in theory, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for their families and friends.
because nowadays wherever you go theory is a big queue and i hate waiting.
finally, theory are a lot of museums in our town. therefore, i would suggest going to the frogs museum, which is really fascinating.
it was a nightmare, theory were pickpockets in the shop.
on the one hand theory are the materials from which the PCs are made, on the other hand is the huge waste problem.
i hadn't thought about a restaurant to go to after the show, because if the advertisement had been right, theory should have been a luxury restaurant where i could eat.
that is fortifier minutes later! it is also advertised that theory were discounts available. however, that was another lie.
you wrote an advertisement saying that people from more than 15 different countries were going to visit this concert, but theory were artists from only 6 countries.
the most exciting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert, and we went to the highlands to spend the whole day theory.
in these galleries theory are historical paintings and antique furniture which Chang used.
we think that we could go theory on the 14th of march, in the evening, instead of going shopping.
theory are a number of hotels or youth hostels to stay overnight, if necessary.
the third problem was that it was written that discounts were available, but when i got theory it was not true.
according to the advertisement you published, theory should have been some important differences to the production i saw.
after this competition theory was mathematics, and two hours of biology.
theory are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but theory are some others which are also very important for me.
the group has been booked into the palace hotel, and the best way to get from theory to the conference is by tube. the location of the conference is then five minutes by foot.
the price was excellent because theory wasn't any time limit.
i strongly recommend you to use public transport in order to get theory, because you may find other types of transportation quite expensive.
the first problem happened at the box office because theory were absolutely no discounts available.
fortunately, theory are many ways to earn some money nowadays.
can you please give me some recommendations about the clothes i will need and also the cost of the food theory to plan my budget.
i was promised that the star was Danny Brock but when i was theory i saw another star that was completely different from your brochure.
in fact theory would be only one possibility in July because i will finish my exams at the end of that month and begin vocational training the 1st of august.
theory was no Danny brook but instead of him theory was a different actor and I'm very disappointed about that because I'm a fan of his.
it is not always easy, but theory are rules in every home and you have to respect them.
and another question is what are the prices of things like theory, which i want to know so that i can make a better budget for my trip.
what is more, theory was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, theory were only six nationalities.
i have further ideas. in the future, maybe in 2113, theory will be houses like now but with more technical things.
theory was no discount at all, which was in contrast with 'discounts available'.
on the other hand, theory are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from their relations with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
i would like to know if the,, travel costs ''which you had paid include entrance tickets to the museums or any other cultural places, because i would like to do some sightseeing in the US's. furthermore, if theory will be Cm tumble dryer or washing machine to clean our clothes and if theory will be a guide who will be responsible for us and the camp.
shopping is not always enjoyable. sometimes theory is a long queue or a machine is broken.
whether theory is a phone, a fax or email so i can be in touch with my family.
although this statement is absolutely true, it seems theory is no way to stop public attention, so they will have to keep living with journalists.
theory will be a number of developments in technology in the future, which could make our life easier to live but what should remain the same is the feeling of being together and love.
however, i hope, theory is water and light inside this log cabin.
theory are many things that can go wrong in the process of acquiring a product or service.
theory, i saw the exhibitions and admired the building itself.
last of all, it says in your advertisement that theory is a theatre restaurant open after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was being redecorated and no announcement was made.
and then about the tickets, you wrote that theory were discounts available but theory were not.
in my opinion the easiest way to get theory from the conference would be by taking the Piccadilly line.
it was a surprise when we were told theory would be another actor.
but other people don't think like this. for example, theory is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost.
the play should have started at 19.30 but it started fortifier minutes later, we were waiting theory without anything to do.
although theory are new machines etc, medicine makes many discoveries thanks to research into different diseases in order to make the population live longer.
if theory is no chance to go to California in July, i could wait until next summer.
also theory will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green peace will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
both of them are as convenient as getting theory.
by problems i mean that the show started at 20.15 and not at W or why theory were no discounts available?
well here in Dublin things are still the same, but i think somebody told you that i went to the mob concert here at the point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. i guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard? well he told me that they needed people to put everything on the stage, so i went to help them and everything else, and when i got to the point, do you know who was theory?
theory was always a lot of security stuff around us to make sure everything was OK, because theory really were thousands of people.
after a few minutes the dream happened: Gareth guitarist-appeared over theory.
it started from got up in the morning, we have the machine help us to cook, iron, cleaning, washing, and then we went out to work, theory are car, sky train to travel for help us convenience and quickly.
when we arrived at the theatre we realised that theory were no discount tickets available as were mentioned in your advertisement so we had to buy the most expensive ones.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so without want i knew that theory was going to be a concert in our city given by, from my point of view, the best group in the world, oasis.
but theory is always a lot of traffic at all times, and the air is so polluted that i can't even breathe.
theory were also the discounts which weren't available.
i actually enjoyed it working theory and i wouldn't hesitate to work theory again.
I'd like to have more tastes during the whole course, not only at the end, because it's making me very lazy.
i came to London for a short holiday to meet new people and to have a tastes of English culture.
i am writing to thank you for notifying me about the competition and i would be very grateful to give to you the information that was requested in your letter.

the whole class and i would like to thank you for the good programmer which you have organised for our trip to London.
first of all, we would like to say thank you very much for organising our tour around London and our programmer, which is considered especially good for us because of the places we will visit.
thank you very much!
first i want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about, for instance, travel and accommodation. i have to tell you that it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my father is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at that time.
i am really surprised for the information because i won, and i would like to say thank you for everything. this is why i wrote and sent this letter with the information you need i can only travel in July because it is the only time when i can do it before for my work i do not really care what accommodation i will have. i would prefer to come in July i will be available for the moment. i would really appreciate it if you could tell the people who work at camp California i choose the golf and photography because i think i am really interested in those subjects. i am not really really good but i have some experience.
i am very grateful and i want to thank you very much for letting me go on this trip.
we believe that the programmer is very good and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time especially for that.
i decided to thank pat, and maybe, if possible, teach her a lesson.
can you believe it, it was mob. so i went to say hello to him, and he asked me, 'would you give me a hand with my decks?' so i went, and when we finished he gave me a shirt and a gold pass to see the concert from the first row. oh my god, Kim, that was the best thing that ever happened to me. well Kim, i hope to receive a letter from you soon, and please tell everybody about the mob concert and everything, thank you.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this thready programmer in London and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.

i received your letter, which says i won the first prize in your competition's weeks at camp California in the US's. i appreciate that and i thank you sincerely for having chosen me as a winner.
I'm writing to answer your questions but, first of all, to thank you for the prize.

i have happily received your reply and i want to thank you for this marvellous prize you have given me.
with reference to our trip to London, on behalf of all of us, the English class in this college, we would like to thank you for your special attention in organising a good programmer to learn about the interesting and cultural places in London.
on behalf of the class i would like to thank you for the excellent programmer you have organised, especially the idea of visiting a gallery.
i am writing to thank you for your letter confirming that i won the first prize in your competition.
i have just received your letter and i thank you for your invitation and congratulations.
i am writing to you to answer your question about the conference in London. thank you for your letter.
thank you very much for the many interesting positions in this schedule, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which, we are sure, will be very exciting.
thank you for your letter, as usual, it's a pleasure to receive news from you.
thank you for any detail more i think we go with you and enjoy a fantastic programmer.
firstly, i would like to thank you warmly for this great prize.
i am writing to you to thank you for your very good organisation of the international arts festival, where i spent two excellent days recently.
thank you for your attention and understanding.
thank you for your letter, which arrived yesterday.
i would like to thank you for your letter you recently sent me concerning the competition for two weeks at camp California in the US's.
thank you for your letter.
first of all, we'd like to thank you for the programmer you have already arranged. it's wonderful because it covers most of our interests.
thank you very much for your cooperation.
i received your letter this morning. thank you very much for your kind letter and for choosing me.
again we're so sorry that we are causing you inconvenience regarding your plan and thank you for considering us.
thank you very much for your offer.
before answering your letter (which i have just received) about the prize for the competition i recently won, I'd like to say thank you very much for giving me the chance of going to the USA.
thank you for this prize, I'm really excited and emotional.
when they finished singing the last song i was surprised when they called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people.
as we have seen the advertisement for the programmer the school arranged for us as a farewell activity, we are very appreciative and would like to thank you for your kindness, as all of them are very interesting and give us a chance to meet and join the other class, which we have hardly done at all.
thank you for the excellent programmer you have organised for our class.
i will always say thank you very much to the inventor who has invented the machines which do the washing and the washing's, before this, women spent a long time doing these tasks.
for your last day i thank it would be interesting to visit our historic and famous city centre.
as for the colours, i thank metallic colours, especially silver, will be the most popular.
i thank in the near future we need to decide with the government
maybe you thank i am exaggerating but recent studies prove that this mania can be really dangerous.
and it is responsible for many changes in my life, and i thank i wouldn't be able to live without it anymore.
i thank going shopping in a big space like Harrods's is not a pleasure.
i thank that competitions should be filmed because my school is a kind of sports school.
everything that we do now we do with a computer: it helps to look after the house, to perform very difficult operations, because the computer can thank much faster than a human.
when you thank of shopping, it reminds you of going out (mostly) with friends, looking for new things like clothes, accessories etc. and buying them.
although we cannot deny it is our nature's are curious can improve our sense of morality and try to thank about the importance of privacy for them.
life is too short to thank about possessions.
i thank i can handle it very well.
i thank the people who enjoy shopping are greedy for materialistic things and they haven't any interests in the spirit (?), in the intellectual life.
when it comes down to colour, i thank it'll be much brighter and maybe glittery.
regarding accommodation at camp California, i would prefer to stay in a log cabin because i thank it is safer than a tent.
in conclusion, i thank that technology has two faces which affect my life as well as everybody Elise's life.
most of the time they have journalists following them everywhere, looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper, and i don't thank this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because they are popular.
concerning the accommodation's be informed that i would prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i thank that the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities have chosen tennis and photography.
i thank it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if they are pushing you), to understand what they like and what they don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
for special occasions, for example a party, a concert, people will dress very smartly. i thank that it will be dresses, and suits sewed by the welkin tailors.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got three buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i thank somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about class rooms it very big and comfortable.
furthermore i would like to choose to stay in a tent instead of a cabin because i thank it could be more exciting and could provide more contact with the environment.
i don't thank i have done such a bad thing as to destroy our friendship.
but other people don't thank like this. for example, there is a case of a woman who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost.
i thank that the government have to protect them and their private life from the journalists, by punishing journalists.
i have just received your letter which made me so happy. i cannot believe that i won first prize in your competition, because i have always believed i am an unlucky man and now i thank some things are changing in my life.
overall, people should thank about what it would be like if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer that all people, including famous people, need a private life and would like to have an ordinary life.
we thank that we could go there on the 14th of march, in the evening, instead of going shopping.
i thank I'm not bad at painting either; at least everyone in my family likes my work, including myself.
that is because, i do not want to seem fussy, but i like to have some luxuries when i am going on holiday and i thank sleeping on the floor without electricity may annoy me.
about the size of houses, i thank that in cities houses will be more and more small because of overpopulation.
i mean i don't thank we'll change cars into aeroplanes...
it was really a new job for me, but i thank i did well.
moreover, i have chosen this month because i thank the weather will be fine.
because of all this trouble i thank we should have our money back.
i thank it is a good idea to include a record of one of our big events such as the annual sports tournament or welcoming evening for new students.
i also thank that the log cabin will be much more comfortable than the tent.
students thank that we don't do anything and we don't learn anything special.
regarding the accommodation, i would prefer a log cabin. i thank that will be safer for all my things.
now, my English teacher has asked me to explain what i thank.
log cabins may be more comfortable. on the other hand i thank that i will be able to "survive" in a tent.
about the accommodation, i thank i would prefer to be in a log cabin instead of a tent, since it is more comfortable.
then i realized that Danny brook did not appear in the show, which was very disappointing for me because i like this actor very much, and i thank that i was not the only one who was upset.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i thank i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favourite and skillful hobby: sailing.
in the end, i asked for i money back (and payment for my horrible night): do you thank anybody will give me something back?!
in my opinion, small shops and the street markets should be supported. on the other hand, the big supermarkets should thank more about the recycling problem, which will be the most important problem in the near future.
i thank after 100 years, at least something will change as regards design, material, colour, etc.
i thank these reasons are sufficient to ask for my money back.
and referring to the question about which type of accommodation i prefer, i choose a log cabin, because i thank that a tent is messier, so i would appreciate it if you give me a cabin.
great fun, very happy, if go with your girlfriend it will feel romantic, you should thank something like this, but do you know it is not always like this?
i thank you can do a lot more things now than before with technology.
regarding the accommodation at camp California, i prefer to rent a tent, which is going to be more fun, i thank, but are the tents singles?
another point which i thank was annoying was the concert hall.
with reference to the accommodation i would rather stay in a tent because i thank it is the best way to socialize.
i thank that some of the changes have been very good, like the improvement in medical science, which now can save millions of people that one hundred years ago were doomed to die or to live miserable lives.
i thank that life without modern technology would be simple and boring. that's why i am using it in my daily life. i am happy that there is such a thing as modern technology.
think about the computer, the speed of computers is much fatter than before.
in my opinion it's a lot better than the dictionary because it's fatter and you really find what you need.
for example, once people had to walk from one place to another, but now we can use science and technology to produce a lot of petrol-powered vehicles and we can travel fatter with them.
everything that we do now we do with a computer: it helps to look after the house, to perform very difficult operations, because the computer can think much fatter than a human.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it fatter and colder.
now i have a new computer, which is very easy to use, and comfortable for my fingers and also fatter.
industrial wheel going fatter and fatter.
the computer is our way of communicating with the outside world, whereas with aeroplanes we can reach our parents and friends easily and much fatter than we would if we used boats or trains.
cooking has become fatter with the help of the microwave.
besides this, the information goes fatter than it used to now and it's available at the same time in every part of the world.
industrial wheel going fatter and fatter.
these days the computer is part of your life, you use it all the time. sometimes you do personal and other times it is just the things you need to do like go to the bank, use transport, go shopping etc. it is a machine that makes life easy and endow you can carry it everywhere. it is amazing the way as the fa's the computer changes, the programs are fatter and more useful and practical.
we can also use technology to produce more food and help them grow fatter.
to make this report easier and fatter, it was necessary to make a questionnaire which was given out in the school.
first i want to thank you for all the congratulations, and I'll try to answer all your questions about, for instance, travel and accommodation. i have to tell you that it is only possible for me to go on holiday in July because my fatter is very ill and it is only possible for my sister to take care of him in July (because her small children are in summer school at that time.
when one day pat came over to my house, we started arguing about ordinary things and during our fight the subject of my fatter and his problems suddenly came up.
that evening my fatter said a few words: 'may this be the end of your career as a thief; we are only ready to forgive if you promise never to start again'
my fatter always remembered his responsibility was to provide his workers with a good salary, which is the aim of his life.
my golf teacher is my fatter and I've only played in a practising centre, but my fatter and his friends say i have good talent for golf.
my golf teacher is my fatter and I've only played in a practising centre, but my fatter and his friends say i have good talent for golf.
anyway, in families they usually have this problem that when they buy a new one, suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and fatter or parents and children.
i told pat that my fatter and mother were going to separate.
i can come to USA in July because in august i will be working with my fatter.
all these years i believed that my fatter was killed in a car accident.
marine's real fatter wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to give her back because they loved marine so much.
i was surprised that my fatter didn't watch me but i soon understood that he was ignoring me.
first she said to her fatter, then to her mother and finally to her brother, that i was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion kilometres from earth and then i was so ashamed because i have been her boyfriend since i came to earth.
not only was i a member of the swimming team in our school, but also i had been taught by my fatter since i was five years old.
i am deeply disappointed with the survive and the unreliable information at your theatre.
i like to sleep in a tent under the open sky since i have done military survive, therefore i would prefer a tent as my accommodation.
i am writing to complain about your survive.
another point that i want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (W) but it started at W, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration many other points like unsatisfactory survive, and uncomfortable seats.
after this introduction, it will be time to show some of the activities everyone can do at the school, such as lessons or others like the library, our protagonist having a coffee with some colleagues in the cafe bar, the reception survive.
as you may understand it was not a perfect night and i was not pleased with the show or even with the survive.
there are many things that can go wrong in the process of acquiring a product or survive.
survive: it is over 100 years old but it is kept in good condition by the local people, who are proud of this castle.
i could say that we cannot survive without them.
since man became man he has needed to hunt to survive. in ancient times he used spears, bows and arrows, and the woman's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff.
i am sure that fashion will survive for ages, it will even change to become easier to use and cleaner, because we all need to feel a part of our society, communicate our way of living and thinking, be part of a group and, at the same time, be different.
i think it wouldn't be possible for us to survive without electric light.
log cabins may be more comfortable. on the other hand i think that i will be able to "survive" in a tent.
they are very useful things which sometimes are necessary to survive.
in conclusion, from my point of view, people must learn that despite technology being such a new area to explore, we have to use it with a great deal of responsibility for us all to survive in the future.
eventually i like shopping too and i believe everybody likes shopping, but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough money to survive.
concerning the activities, as a matter of fact tennis is my favourite sport and i am very keen on it. for the second activity i would like to enrol in surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient suffer, keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and i think it is worthwhile trying, therefore I'd love to be in the beginners 'group.
i also like surfing. i think it is a dangerous sport, but i know how to do it, because of the fact that last year a professional suffer taught me.
i think that it is very dangerous because the famous people cannot have a private life and consequently they may suffer from depression and sadness, which may lead them to suicide.
to cut a long story short, because of everything i have said above, the correct thing for me to do is to ask for my money back, and for you it is just to give it back to me because of all the trouble and disappointment you have made me suffer.

regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i think i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in Freon of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favourite and skillful hobby: sailing.
most of the time they have journalists following them everywhere, looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the Freon page of the newspaper, and i don't think this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because they are popular.
after the stage was built, the rest of the things i had to do were quite easy and enjoyable; i could stay either behind or in Freon of the stage and give a hand if needed. i really enjoyed it because i learnt a lot of technical things i didn't know; and what i also enjoyed was the good pay!

Freon that moment i enjoyed working until the concert had finished. the atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because they understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team.

the reason why I'm writing to you is the class and i have seen an advertisement for the London fashion and leisure show on Tuesday, march 14 Freon 10.00 AM PM.
before it was packed into by the audience, we had to clean around the reception, but totally it was really exciting although i was just a member of staff in the small reception, because i felt great excitement (especially girls!) Freon people queuing.
about accommodation i would prefer a cabin, because i suffer Freon allergies, and i think a tent would not be very suitable for my health.

first of all, on the Sweet i received, it says that Danny brook was one of the actors. that is not true, because instead of him, there was another actor, and i don't know what his name is.
however, i would add that journalist's aware of that hard topical try to moderate what theta write in order to respect other people's privacy; since theta would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
i was very nervous because I'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't help it and i started crying can imagine, theta were so handsome that i couldn't believe Ito tried to calm down because i had to work, and later i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting that the time went very stealthy i was workaround it was like a dream.

when theta finished singing the last song i was surprised when theta called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people.
theta were eager to have a child, but theta had never been able to.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as theta are constantly followed by reporters, which makes their life miserable.
i feel that theta would be fabulous places with a western design.
yesterday when i arrived at college, i saw pat standing with peter and a lot of other boys and theta were looking strangely at me and laughing.
but we should not forget that theta are only tools and should emphasise human relationships.
it doesn't matter who theta are, where theta come from, what colour skin theta have.
most of the time he gets lost, or theta start playing around, making noise, bothering people, etc... and when this happens you get in a bad mood and you'll have a bad day shopping.
theta want too much fromstudent and are unkind to them.
lastly i would like to inform you that i wanted to have dinner at your restaurant but theta told me it was closed because it usually closes at W o'clock,
you can inform all the students that theta can take some traditional food to the party.
theta are human beings and theta need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that theta are unknown and anonymous and theta do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time theta want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
the things that really disappointed me were that you said Danny brook and Tina truelove were the actors but theta weren't, different actors played and to be honest theta made the whole show very bad.
besides that the most important thing is that these children have an easy adolescence and theta haven't got psychological problems and theta are useful in society.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training theta enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, theta have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because theta enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
it would not only emphasize the sharp contrast between this and the classroom atmosphere but also show how theta are as young people.
people used to wear very different things from the clothes we wear now, we wouldn't even say that theta are 'clothes'.
all of them were shocked by what theta heard.
in order to fulfil their readers 'requirements theta constantly follow them.
but about the differences between the homes of the rich and poor, theta will be the same in the future.
women, in particular, have the annoying habit of always having to touch everything theta see.
theta are very useful things which sometimes are necessary to survive.
on the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses, but on the other hand theta discovered many illnesses which we hadn't heard about before.
i was sure that discounts were available because i had read that theta were, but at the ticket office theta didn't offer them.
theta are human beings and theta need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that theta are unknown and anonymous and theta do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time theta want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
in the advertisement 'discounts available' was written. shall i ask you one question's weren't theta available?
it is true, theta deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time, however this publicity brings them money, and a comfortable life.
the real thing was that i had to look after them because without me theta would have been lost.
afterwards we could let people talk with the artists so theta could get to know them personally.
i particularly liked listening to their musicians when theta played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc.
everybody gets up at six, and the first thing theta do is run for about two thousand five hundred metres.
theta are much more comfortable than tents.
but, on the other hand, people will still have to programmer them, as theta have to do nowadays.
theta were worse than the previous actors.
to answer our first question about where i would prefer to sleep, i prefer tents because theta are closer to nature and i like sleeping in sleeping bags W BB bags).
i was promised that after the show i could go to the theatre restaurant but due to the show starting late it also finished late, therefore, when i went to the restaurant theta were definitely closed.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training theta enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, theta have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because theta enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
i met a lot of different people and theta all taught me something new about behaviour or compassion.
for example, if the shop is full of people, it is not enjoyable, because theta will create too much confusion, too much noise with the risk of wasting time.
they're fighting for the same reason with the same strength, the man has to kill a brother, as he calls the fish.
theta will become less dark and more comfortable than today.
and sometimes theta do something in the library by themselves in the afternoon.
'as i have a choice i would prefer to stay in log cabins rather than tents because theta seem to be more comfortable and you are not so dependent on weather conditions.
to sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects theta study, but it should concern their sports activities as well.
you are never going to believe what i did last month. i was walking with my sister in oxford circus, when suddenly a man stopped us saying that he was looking for people to help at a concert and theta were going to pay us five pounds an hour.
some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously, maybe just a bit too seriously. theta gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or members of other gangs, trying to start fights with them.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match their new skirt, so theta are looking everywhere, pushing you because theta think that you will take the shirt that theta want.
theta taught me specially.
often people can't buy a piece of bread. and theta ask for money from other people.
in conclusion most of the time that you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and theta are more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depending on what, why, where and who is the person that you are interested in pleasing.
i walked alone a long distance until i found a telephone. i called the police and theta ask for a rescue.
theta promised me that theta would call me someday, which i particularly doubt.
according to my job, i had to help the teams with the outfights and, of course, it was my first professional experience: in the end i felt like one of them, because theta were so kind to me, and i could help a lot and i learnt a lot with this project.
in the past people didn't have electricity and if theta wanted, for example, to read or to cook something theta used to light a fire.
maybe theta will be in many colours and theta will be very tight.
we were also surprised to discover that the student discounts weren't available for us, because theta didn't accept our student identity cards from Switzerland.
but when i hear the word future, i have an image of metallic colours so that in my imagination theta are wearing metallic or brightly coloured clothes.
after that theta changed the principal actor, the one that replaced him was very bad, that made us really angry.
i guess theta will wear a sort of tunic over a shirt and a skirt, or more masculine clothes because theta want to change.
it seemed to be the most interesting lesson, because students always make some mistakes while theta are practising with their partner, in spite of having been told by the teacher ten times.
as theta know about your interests and personality, it is easy to help you.
theta can relax, reduce their stress and theta are happy when theta find the thing which theta wanted.
theta are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because theta cannot stop themselves unless theta have not got money to spend.
most of the time theta have journalists following them everywhere, looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper, and i don't think this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because theta are popular.
i think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if theta are pushing you), to understand what theta like and what theta don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
on the other hand, some people refuse to wear that sort of clothes so theta prefer to wear nothing.
most of the time theta have journalists following them everywhere, looking for a great story or interesting pictures to put on the front page of the newspaper, and i don't think this is very nice, but it is the price that famous people have to pay, just because theta are popular.
and the best way to get from there to the conference is by coach, as there are about 35 international students, and theta are all strangers here.
first, i got there at W pm, because the show was about to start at W pm, and i needed some time to buy the tickets. i bought two tickets for £ 20 and when i asked for a discount, theta didn't give me one, then i was kept waiting for the show to start until W pm.
can you guess who theta chose for the job, "me", yes, me, i couldn't believe it.
and, finally, right before the start theta announced that Danny brook would not be in the show that evening.
research has shown that almost every single household owns a PC. some people use them for their job because theta need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun.
not only these subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, biology and physical training, but as we study them we understand that theta are not so important as our main subjects.
theta need to be with their family in peace.
if you interested in the clothes as well, but you need to remember, one is male, but one is female, theta should have different fashion, at that moment should be had one is boring or have some bad chat, so in the end you both will feel unhappy or angry with each other.
first of all theta talk about the environmental pollution which cars and other vehicles create, overspending the electricity using electric equipment and some other problems.
one day when i was there alone, i heard some other kids approaching. i sat down behind one of the stones so theta couldn't see me.
Jane explained that situation and theta understood her.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before, and some women don't earn money. theta have no idea how difficult it is to earn money.
chairs are not only part of the furniture, theta are also objects of decoration and you can even find some in museums where theta are art objects.
we said yes immediately. i nearly shouted with happiness when theta told us that Luis Miguel was giving the concert. he is my favourite singer.
she was sent to new York to discover how some people from the government gave money to the merchants because theta wanted to build a trade centre there.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel three, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
first of all, I'll tell you that on the day of the concert i woke up at W AM., very early for me. you know me, I'm lazy. the work began around W. it was very hard but then the band came to rehearse. from that moment i enjoyed working until the concert had finished. the atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because theta understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team.
theta have a very simple life and behaviour when theta aren't on the stage.
theta are human beings and theta need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that theta are unknown and anonymous and theta do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time theta want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
about a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, theta cooked their food on the fire and theta didn't have pens.
in addition to this, you may have some robots bringing the newspaper to the table, tidying up the house, and doing the shopping. maybe theta will also be your life partners.
i am not talking about some kind of achievements in those disciplines but theta are my big passion
theta can relax, reduce their stress and theta are happy when theta find the thing which theta wanted.
also, that theta will invite a psychologist, the author of the book and maybe the president will talk so i recommend you listen to it.
theta can also talk with British students to communicate study experience.
1) first of all, theta are located in the centre of Rome so theta can take a bus to get to them move and around the city.
anyway, in families theta usually have this problem that when theta buy a new one, suddenly theta have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between mother and father or parents and children.
anyway, we definitely know that they're going to change.
but, i got through it. i had to take care of them during the break, serving drinks, clothes, i even brought them some cigarettes and anything theta wanted.
well here in Dublin things are still the same, but i think somebody told you that i went to the mob concert here at the point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. i guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is that, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one that works as a security guard? well he told me that theta needed people to put everything on the stage, so i went to help them and everything else, and when i got to the point, do you know who was there?
a log cabin would be the ideal accommodation. presumably theta are more spacious than tents and it would be easier to keep tidy.
at the concert theta were very successful because theta were very confident and i helped with the sound system and our equipment was extraordinary and the audience were fantastic.
at the end of the video, we should find one or two students sit together and ask them a few questions about how theta feel about studying at the school? this is the suggestion to making a daily life video in school.
theta become lazy because theta know that theta can sit on the sofa and change the channels on the TV by pressing a button.
well theta didn't accept my £ 20 discount ticket. why?
theta promised me that theta would call me someday, which i particularly doubt.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and theta develop their own styles which suit them the most.
i helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and theta even let me play with their guitars!
thirdly, in your advertisement it said that discounts would be available, but theta were not.
it doesn't matter who theta are, where theta come from, what colour skin theta have.
i think the people who enjoy shopping are greedy for materialistic things and theta haven't any interests in the spirit (?), in the intellectual life.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because theta can afford it and theta don't mind paying the full price for their clothes.
i always prefer to read books that are unusual in some way, because theta give me the opportunity to escape from everyday reality.
shopmania is really unstoppable. i know women who do everything theta can to buy only a dress, or even worse, women who buy things theta have no use for, for example, snap, sculptures, kitchen tissues, or everything sold by telemarketing that really is useless, but theta cannot resist the fact of it "being there."
i went to buy a ticket and as i like to enjoy the show near the stage i bought a £ 20 ticket but when i asked for a discount theta told me, "i am sorry but there was an error in the advertisement. it will be impossible to give you a discount".
so theta can be just ordinary people like us.
the best thing to do would be to show the cooking personnel because theta are very nice.
i really hate going shopping with girls to buy clothes because when theta go into a shop theta want to try on every single item of clothing and theta do not realise the time.
theta always did things together, and theta were the most popular boys in school. both were very handsome, played football; theta were an example for everybody.
and it's always interesting to watch others while theta do something like that.
theta will be comfortable clothes because the main point for any kind of clothing is to be comfortable.
those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable, but theta take us away from our friends, our families and moreover theta lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything that surrounds us and keeps us alive.
when i got to the theatre i asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but theta were not available.
as well will have the responsibility of looking after my brother when theta aren't at home.
first of all, when i paid my entrance fee theta didn't accept my discount ticket, theta told me that the ticket was fake, then i entered the theatre and i had to wait 45 minutes. the show was supposed to start at W and it started at W, "this shows a lack of respect".
basically, i helped them liaise with the local police and get some electronic equipment that theta needed.
firstly, i would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an international arts festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it said that i would find stars and artists from around the world, when, in fact, theta were from only six countries.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something theta want to have, theta will do everything theta can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes theta even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
as for accommodation, i would prefer log cabins, because i believe theta are more comfortable than tents.
poisonous chemical compounds, EEG. gases and liquids, are created too. theta have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming their brain and their bodies, and it can also cause death.
apart from that i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between these two I'd prefer to stay in tents because theta give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
shopmania is really unstoppable. i know women who do everything theta can to buy only a dress, or even worse, women who buy things theta have no use for, for example, snap, sculptures, kitchen tissues, or everything sold by telemarketing that really is useless, but theta cannot resist the fact of it "being there."
the advertisement said that theta would be available but theta were not.
suddenly theta all shouted "surprise!".
it is as if theta lose their conscience while theta are shopping.
i think that it is very dangerous because the famous people cannot have a private life and consequently theta may suffer from depression and sadness, which may lead them to suicide.
to sum up, although i think theta ought to abandon their lives partly when theta enter the world of fame, theta should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if theta do not allow the paparazzi to take their pictures, because although theta are famous theta also have their private life.
the staff in that department were really friendly and helpful and theta were also huge, like giants.
theta are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something that will make their neighbour jealous.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when theta can buy something new for their cars, motorbikes or computers.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when theta decided to move to London, theta invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
it may, in many cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and theta had to know there is no private life inseparably connected to it.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something theta want to have, theta will do everything theta can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes theta even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
for the end-of-conference party we have booked one of the halls of the hotel and theta will provide us with live music and catering.
many years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all these things and theta had to work a lot.
future students could appreciate coming if theta could still do their sport.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if theta don't get their pay first.
i can find cold water in the refrigerator but 50 years ago theta didn't have the refrigerator, so our life is easier today.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when theta decided to move to London, theta invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i had put some money aside for that month, thinking about the discount, but when i went to buy them theta said that discounts were not available.
if you have children, you will know very well that when you are busy doing something and the children see something theta want to have, theta will do everything theta can do to make you buy it for them, sometimes theta even cry or shout at you and it is really annoying.
it doesn't matter who theta are, where theta come from, what colour skin theta have.
it is as if theta lose their conscience while theta are shopping.
if somebody wants to be famous of course theta must be on the top and the mass media will be following him or her.
in a supermarket, shop or department store theta have many things.
when theta finished singing the last song i was surprised when theta called me up on the stage and said thank you to me in front of hundreds of people.
but technology has not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us things that can make our lives more comfortable, it has also created things that aren't bad, but if theta are in the hands of the wrong people theta can destroy the world.
these are my favourite because theta have a lot to do with water, but i like them more than surfing.
and what about those kinds of intellectual and progressive people, don't theta all wear the same type of ugly but comfortable shoes?
more and more people buy mobile phones, because theta are very useful, you get a lot of possibilities like: using the internet, buying different goods, booking tickets, controlling your home techno and many others.
some people when theta are tired relax by sleeping, reading a book or watching television, but not me.
theta found him two months later and six months later he was in jail.
i had a discount ticket, but theta refused it and i had to pay the full price.
theta believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because theta will be outgoing, amusing, etc.
regarding the accommodation, i would prefer a log cabin because in my opinion tents are very uncomfortable to sleep in and theta aren't very cosy.
sometimes theta give up, before theta get something,
in accordance with what you have told me about the accommodation i would prefer to go and stay in tents, because i think they're unusual and that is not something that you do every day.
it was boring theta nothing happened for such a long time on the stage.
we are all customers of the big supermarkets. they have all theta we need.
well here in Dublin things are still the same, but i think somebody told you theta i went to the mob concert here at the point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. i guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is theta, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one theta works as a security guard? well he told me theta they needed people to put everything on the stage, so i went to help them and everything else, and when i got to the point, do you know who was there?
in addition, the resort has an interesting historical background concerning the architecture and the best facilities and activities theta you could have in Mexico, for example, it provides different kinds of tours around Mexico.
weapons and factories are destroying our planet and we need to realise theta we have to use technology to improve our lives, while always trying to respect nature.
i am writing this letter to complain about the treatment theta we received when we went to the circle theatre in order to see the musical show "over the rainbow", whose actors were Anthony keens and Tina truelove.
the advertisement for the musical said theta it was going to be Danny brook. unfortunately there was someone Olsen actor who i do not like and if i had known theta he was going to be there i would not have gone to see him.
nearly at the end of this letter i have to say theta the idea of the weekend ticket was really good because it gave the people the opportunity to attend for a whole weekend for a cheap price.
the advertisement also says theta there are discounts available but this is not true, there were none.
one of the reasons theta i have visited your arts festival was to see a lot of plays. in the future, i hope to be an actress and theta's why i want to learn something from the professionals.
when i first heard about over the rainbow i was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when i heard about the extras theta the circle theatre was offering, it became the best opportunity i ever had to attend a musical of theta type, but instead of being the best evening i ever had, it was a total disaster and theta's the reason why i am writing to you.
on the other hand, i understand very well theta it is really necessary. i also understand theta nobody will do theta in my place.
so theta's why they have invented the telephone.
i might say theta i am really good at swimming and sailing because i have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and i have had a really good training in water sports.
on the development, they also said theta there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty's years old but theta was totally wrong because i paid the full price, which was £ 20.
so, unfortunately, i must say theta last night was one of the worst nights i ever had, and having given the reasons, i expect to be able to count on your sense of responsibility, so, i feel theta i must ask for my 20 pounds i spent on theta terrible night.
conversely, painting is an activity which i have never tried before, so i have not any skill in drawing but i would like to start doing theta now when i have the chance.
we think theta we could go there on the 14th of march, in the evening, instead of going shopping.
i went inside to ask about theta package but they told me theta it was gone, so, i went to many shops just to get the same answer.
i think theta it will be nice for the end-of-conference party if you invite somebody to sing and give the students the time to enjoy themselves and to dance.
firstly, i should say theta i would like to travel in July because theta is the month which i could most likely have off from work to go on holiday.
first, i think we should rent bigger halls so theta we can make a better sound and give more space for the audience!
when i was a child i never liked to go shopping because my mum spent so much time in the shops theta i remember theta going shopping with her was a nightmare.
after two hours i thought theta all of this information was written from a foreign point of view and it wasn't the native opinion.
it was clear theta pat had to change and show his friends theta they could believe in him thoroughly.
i hope theta our friend Richard brown doesn't have any serious illnesses.
in accordance with what you have told me about the accommodation i would prefer to go and stay in tents, because i think they're unusual and theta is not something theta you do every day.
i am writing to you about my complaints about the musical show at your theatre theta i watched a week ago, during my stay in London.
naturally we have a lot of interesting things to visit but something theta is special is our cathedral.
and theta is always what we want.
at theta time i was lucky and also, i would like to recommend it to other friends.
i would not really like to be a famous person, because you are not really yourself, and for me theta is the most important thing.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i think i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so theta i will be able to do my favourite and skillful hobby: sailing.
some people think theta being a famous person is a very exciting thing, theta all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think theta if you are famous you are special as well.
those things can and do make our lives easier and more comfortable, but they take us away from our friends, our families and moreover they lead us to madness and cut off any relationship with everything theta surrounds us and keeps us alive.
while i was standing on the beach, suddenly i heard someone call my name and say theta i had to go home. theta is right, it was my mum.
after theta, your restaurant was closed without reason.
lastly i would like to inform you theta i wanted to have dinner at your restaurant but they told me it was closed because it usually closes at W o'clock,
we think theta this is a great opportunity and we are all very interested in going because we can see there the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, a lot of different kinds of makeup and some famous hairstylists.
when we saw your leaflet theta mentioned "London's newest and best musical show", we were so enthusiastic and curious theta we immediately bought the tickets.
thirdly, the advertisement said theta discounts were available but the ticket seller said theta there was no discount allowing or available.
he explained to me theta it was to control the light.
they are ready to sacrifice all their savings to get something theta will make their neighbour jealous.
it all started when pat, nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his house. most of the class disagreed with theta because the pat's house is extremely little, they started to say to him theta his house was like a box.
I'd like to organize my trip for July because theta is when i have vacations, also because it is summertime in the US's. about accommodation at camp I'd prefer a tent, because it's a new experience for me and I'd like to sleep in a tent to have a great time while having a new adventure.
i am writing in order to express my disappointment at the show "over the rainbow", performed 2 weeks ago; first of all, i read in the advertisement theta Danny brook was to act in the show, but the actor theta really played was a different one, and this was very disappointing.
theta is fortifier minutes later! it is also advertised theta there were discounts available. however, theta was another lie.
eventually i like shopping too and i believe everybody likes shopping, but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after theta and the most important thing is make sure you have enough money to survive.
maria talked to pat about the stupid thing theta she had done, but pat refused to apologise to her, because she felt it wasn't a mistake and she did it for only one reason: to help maria to get the man theta she loved.
theta was fantastic!
this excellent book tells the story of a man of 25 years theta has a little boy, his son, theta lives in a very bad condition.
another thing theta makes you furious is when you see a great shirt in a shop and somebody else takes it away or buys it before you can react.
as you know, i like drawing and painting when i have some free time so theta is why i chose to paint the scenery.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt theta will match their new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think theta you will take the shirt theta they want.
overall, people should think about what it would be like if we were famous people... and then we can find the answer theta all people, including famous people, need a private life and would like to have an ordinary life.
i was surprised theta he believed me.
those book is about a man who knows theta he will die soon, he knows theta he didn't make his dream come true.
I'm writing to you to give my opinion of theta great festival you organised last 21 and 22 of November.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat theta on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover.
i think theta everyone should think not just about the positive side of technology but also the negative.
i can travel in July only because i am working in an office and i must ask my boss for a holiday and it's the month he can give me one, so i hope theta isn't a problem for you.
in conclusion, i can say theta this is not the biggest problem theta the world has and-- it is not my problem because i am not famous!
how has modern technology changed my daily life? i think theta technology has changed my life and everybody's life in many ways.
i believe theta modern technology has positively affected our lives.
you know theta i always wanted to help at a concert. to be part of the staff would be wonderful, i thought. and i was right!
i reckon theta it's not an easy read, but as you described your cousin, i think she really will enjoy it, she's so good at literature theta it won't be a problem for her.
the things theta really disappointed me were theta you said Danny brook and Tina truelove were the actors but they weren't, different actors played and to be honest they made the whole show very bad.
first of all, there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are theta it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
i was very hopeful theta i was going to have a good time.
i must say though, i would have to travel in July because it's the summer holidays for schools and i would like to spend some of them in California and visit a few friends if theta is possible.
the concerts and the dance show were incredible, except for the classical concert theta was in too small a hall.
theta is fortifier minutes later! it is also advertised theta there were discounts available. however, theta was another lie.
i was so disappointed about theta.
I'm very happy theta i won first prize in your competition.
now theta the students have gathered together this year to make a video about the best lessons and activities theta we have in school, everything possible of course with help of teacher ms. westbrook.
when we arrived at the theatre we realised theta there were no discount tickets available as were mentioned in your advertisement so we had to buy the most expensive ones.
there were 963 people at the "Armageddon" theta night!
i also think theta the log cabin will be much more comfortable than the tent.
after helping to do theta and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands.
so, the next day pat went and told his sister sally theta her friends were organising a surprise party for her birthday.
also, i want to say theta the plays and films were excellent, but there weren't enough of them for me.
but i could see theta his face was happy and he wasn't telling lies.
at the end i feel very tired and angry, because i have spent the whole morning doing nothing, except for looking at them trying on different clothes, and theta's not enjoyable at all, in fact it's really annoying.
every day scientists and technologists discover and produce more and more new things and theta is good. it has to be like theta, we have to go forward not backward from the point where we are now.
at first i couldn't believe theta i was a winner
because of this, we would kindly ask you to change the programmer so theta we could go to this particular event.
also in the advertisement you wrote theta discounts were available, but they weren't, and also theta people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show to eat some thing or to have a drink.
however, 15% thought theta it was not a good idea because it would be boring to see other people enjoying themselves and they mentioned it as not really important.
i would prefer to stay in a tent, because in theta way i can feel closer to nature, and i can remember when i was a girl scout.
i can tell you theta it was a wonderful experience.
firstly, you advertised theta Danny brook, who is my favourite, is the lead but there was another actor instead of him.
so, after all of theta, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice theta the restaurant wasn't open.
i noticed theta the artists were from only six countries instead theta from around the world.
i believe theta if somebody wants fame and glory he must be totally clear about the results.
the reason I'm writing this letter to you is theta during my stay in London i felt very disappointed about your theatre.
another reason is theta it will be more useful for foreign students who want to speak English.
i was surprised theta my father didn't watch me but i soon understood theta he was ignoring me.
you stated in your advertisement theta he would come on stage, but instead of him someone else turned up.
after theta they changed the principal actor, the one theta replaced him was very bad, theta made us really angry.
Sarah realized theta everybody was nice and friendly to her but something was going on in the class, when she turned around talking and whispering started.
the things theta people wear are changing all the time, everyone tries to be different in public and very different sorts of clothes are being created.
despite the fact theta i felt exhausted i must admit theta it was one of the days i will never forget throughout my whole life
i also sold a pamphlet of theta concert, CD and shirts.
such as a mobile phone theta helps me to communicate with anyone in the world, even if i am not at home; i use a stereo if i want to listen to my favourite music; i use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, etc.
i prefer theta because i will travel with my wife and she always prefers theta kind of accommodation.
also i wanted to tell you theta the show was very boring.
the big secret was theta Anna was preparing a surprise party for her brother john and she didn't want anyone to know about it.
two days before i read an advertisement for this show, which said theta Danny brook was starring.
I've always wanted to taste the freedom theta birds have, always been interested in listening to my blood pumping in my veins, full of adrenaline, to let myself free, to shake from excitement.
i prefer theta kind of accommodation because i can have a kitchen or even a bathroom there, but i can't have it in a tent.
in conclusion, i believe theta we have a right to be informed about their lives, providing theta journalists respect some important rules.
a veteran fisherman takes his boat and goes fishing to convince himself and other men theta he is still able to do it.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe theta the first lesson theta should be filmed is philosophy.
my boyfriend told me theta he wanted to surprise his friend in his class when the time came.
furthermore, the show started at W while the advertisement said theta it was going to begin at W.
manager, i expect theta you have considered my bad experience at your theatre, so I'm asking you for my money back, because it was a very bad evening.
for example, imagine theta you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate outfit.
plus, it is mentioned in your advertisement theta discounts are available. in fact, no discount was given to me, though i am a student and as a student i was entitled to get a discount but i paid £ 20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show.
and i would like to make sure theta he really loved me.
we believe theta the programmer is very good and well organised and we would like to thank you one more time especially for theta.
log cabins may be more comfortable. on the other hand i think theta i will be able to "survive" in a tent.
however, i feel theta at the moment there should emerge more groups to control this development because of the industrial pollution theta has been created and it seems theta it's very little, what is being done at the moment in relation to our environment.
if an activity has stayed with us, mankind, for so long, it must give us some pleasure and maybe theta's why shopping has become such an important thing in our lives because it gives you pleasure when you find what you have been looking for and if you can get it for less than the price marked on it, theta is the greatest of ecstasies.
the problem is theta most of the advertisement was misleading.
i believe theta i am like theta, i belong to theta century.
one day, i innocently told pat theta i was dating Philip scythe, the school's hunk and most popular boy.
i am writing this letter to inform you theta i have received your letters and i am going on the trip.
i think theta shopping can be both enjoyable and enjoyable because sometimes the shops are full of people, especially at the weekends, which normally is the only appropriate time!
about the gyms, i like them very much. those places have so many machines theta you can easily lose weight and develop a wonderful body.
theta was cruel, because i was very hungry after the show.
well here in Dublin things are still the same, but i think somebody told you theta i went to the mob concert here at the point, which is the big venue for events and concerts. i guess it was the best concert I've ever been to, but the coolest thing is theta, well do you remember my friend Luke, the one theta works as a security guard? well he told me theta they needed people to put everything on the stage, so i went to help them and everything else, and when i got to the point, do you know who was there?
in conclusion, besides all theta i mentioned, i highly recommend you video the students 'daily life and interview them.
worst of all, at the end of the musical, i went to your theatre restaurant, in order to have dinner, because i had left home without eating and so i was hungry at theta time.
these days the computer is part of your life, you use it all the time. sometimes you do personal and other times it is just the things you need to do like go to the bank, use transport, go shopping etc. it is a machine theta makes life easy and endow you can carry it everywhere. it is amazing the way as the fa's the computer changes, the programs are faster and more useful and practical.
i like to go window shopping theta is good to go around the shopping centre.
I'm not keen on liars, Mr smith, and i think theta you've lied to naive tourists like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the parts and we only had different, pitiful ones.
i noticed theta the artists were from only six countries instead theta from around the world.
so, the show was not good at all and my evening was spoiled in spite of all theta the advertisement promised.
there's no doubt theta modern technology has changed our lives, but how?
apart from theta, the show started at W, not at W, as it said in the advertisement and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished.
i hope you appreciate my letter and theta you'll try to amend these problems./ sally Sven's
however, the point theta i am trying to make is theta you just ruined my holiday.
you are never going to believe what i did last month. i was walking with my sister in oxford circus, when suddenly a man stopped us saying theta he was looking for people to help at a concert and they were going to pay us five pounds an hour.
first of all, i believe theta if someone has time to go to the shops has the possibility.
so, if you are looking for a "really splendid science fiction book" i will recommend you to read "a window.." and I'm sure theta when you finish reading it you will want to read it again, and again...!
the thing is theta we have seen an advertisement for the London fashion and leisure show.
and i think theta i made the right choice of profession's is the perfect combination: a very progressive form of modern technology, and the most important thing's is extremely interesting to me!
the activities theta i would like to do are singing, because my friend told me theta I'm good at it, and the other activity theta i would like to do is climbing because i think it is very exciting although i have never tried climbing, because there are no mountains in my city.
this modern technology gets closer between person to another person, get close between worldwide, so theta, this modern technology changed our daily life so different.
the best thing was theta i have learned how to take care of their expensive instruments and i have sung my favourite songs with them.
when i first heard about over the rainbow i was very excited about the idea of seeing it, plus when i heard about the extras theta the circle theatre was offering, it became the best opportunity i ever had to attend a musical of theta type, but instead of being the best evening i ever had, it was a total disaster and theta's the reason why i am writing to you.
in the advertisement for the show you said theta one of the stars was going to be Danny brook, and to my surprise there was a different actor, and theta really disappointed me.
i think theta is going to be more comfortable for me due to the fact theta i am very sensitive to changes of temperature and i can't take the risk of catching a cold because, as you know, I'm going to start to work.
i read in your advertisement in Friday's edition of the times theta the show should start at 19.30 but the performance started at 20.15.
however, i would add theta journalist's aware of theta hard topical try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have their own private life exposed!
i accept and i want to inform you theta i can travel only in July because i have booked my annual leave for theta period.
thank you for your letter and for having informed me about the results of the competition. i also want to congratulate you on your excellent competition, thanks to which i have the opportunity to go to California, a place theta i always wanted to go to.
i am very surprised theta such a reputable theatre like yours has been able to break all the promises theta were made in the advertisement.
i would like to inform you theta we have seen an advertisement for the "London fashion and leisure show" and we have found it very interesting.
I'm looking forward to learning how to take care of myself in dangerous situations, such as getting lost in a forest, and i think staying in a tent will be very useful for theta.
we thought theta with theta beautiful weather the seaside would be just perfect for relaxation, sunbathing and joy.
the part theta i enjoyed the most was theta i felt i was doing something worthwhile for the community and also theta i got to meet a lot of people.
for example, a car, which is used by everyone every day, changed my daily life in the sense theta i don't need my dad or my mum to go skating or to go to work. i can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of technology, but because i can show theta i am responsible.
beside theta, I'm allergic, and theta causes me problems when I'm close to nature.
wherever you go everyone would love you because of your trousers, which would clean away all the rubbish theta is on the road.
on the other hand, there are the ones theta are also respectable but, apart from their relations with journalists because of their work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
i have given a questionnaire to other students in my class to know their preferences regarding this choice and we all believe theta the first lesson theta should be filmed is philosophy.
it is not too comfortable, but theta is not a problem for me. i like this kind of holiday.
i write this letter to tell you about the programmer theta starts tomorrow, about theta excellent book i have told you to read.
the activities theta i would like to do are singing, because my friend told me theta I'm good at it, and the other activity theta i would like to do is climbing because i think it is very exciting although i have never tried climbing, because there are no mountains in my city.
after theta we have to make sure theta we explain about the relationship between teachers and students, showing the times theta we have been out together.
how are you? I'm not so well, and theta's the reason why I'm writing this letter to you.
but there was a little problem and it was theta my parents didn't let me go to discos alone, so i had to go illegally, and i decided i would do it.
last week i attended the musical "over the rainbow", and i am writing in order to complain about things theta really disappointed me.
i know it sounds extremely boring and theta is exactly what i thought when i was asked to help, but to my surprise it turned out to be much more fun than expected.
i am afraid theta i couldn't write to you immediately, but last month i enjoyed helping at a pop concert and so i was very busy.
i would love to do climbing and surfing just because those are sports i have never tried before. theta means i do not have any experience.
there are some of the devices of modern technology theta most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
after theta "show" we were starving and we had planned to eat in your theatre restaurant but what a surprise!
i was very nervous because I'd never been to a concert before and an hour before everything started the singer and the musicians were there and i couldn't help it and i started crying can imagine, they were so handsome theta i couldn't believe Ito tried to calm down because i had to work, and later i began to feel more comfortable and when the concert started everything was so exciting theta the time went very stealthy i was workaround it was like a dream.
in this book Hemingway is trying to tell us, theta if we want something, we can get it, it might be difficult and take a long time but we can do it.
it is believed theta our lifestyle has been changed by modern technology such as computers and washing machines etc.
i hope theta all the information you need will be provided satisfactorily.
and the difference is theta those children are effective when they grow up and want to have a family, they do the same as their parents and have a happy family.
i have just received your letter saying theta i have won the competition. i must say i was really surprised and happy to be given the opportunity to join the camp for two weeks.
theta was very disappointing.
i thought theta Danny brook, who is my favourite actor, would perform in theta show.
the reasonably-priced package, including tickets and accommodation, well suited my personal situation: comfortable rooms theta are easy to reach and booked tickets can help you if you decide at the last minute.
theta meant i had to read the recipes very carefully.
I'm writing to you to explain the problem theta i have had in your theatre.
Danny brook is one of my favourite actors so i decided to buy a ticket even though i had to cancel my appointment on theta day at 18.30 and also notice of price discount impressed me.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is theta instead of buying a piece of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
i told pat theta my father and mother were going to separate.
but also there are some notes theta you should improve in next year's festival to make it absolutely wonderful.
besides theta the most important thing is theta these children have an easy adolescence and they haven't got psychological problems and they are useful in society.
i let this pass and i bought it anyway, thinking theta it was possible theta this was only a mistake in your advertisement.
about the size of houses, i think theta in cities houses will be more and more small because of overpopulation.
also it was said theta discounts would be available, but i didn't receive any discount as you were cheating us. i know theta you have a big responsibility but if you have told something to people, stick to it.
for special occasions, for example a party, a concert, people will dress very smartly. i think theta it will be dresses, and suits sewed by the welkin tailors.
those book is about a man who knows theta he will die soon, he knows theta he didn't make his dream come true.
when you ask to, the sales person often answers theta your size is out of stock.
this is something theta has troubled many people, especially those who work in the fashion industry.
i am thinking here particularly of the fact theta every event and action is widely discussed in the massed.
on the development, they also said theta there would be a discount for students who are between eighteen and twenty's years old but theta was totally wrong because i paid the full price, which was £ 20.
you also mention theta your show would start at 19.30 but to my knowledge it started at W and theta meant fortifier minutes of waiting.
you know theta I'm a little bit lazy, but the main reason for not writing to you has been the accumulation of exams during this month.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. i knew theta he's a very talkative person, but it was necessary because i wanted him to be the main organiser of theta birthday party for teens.
i was sure theta discounts were available because i had read theta they were, but at the ticket office they didn't offer them.
i hope theta my opinion can help you to organize for next year a great international arts festival alone to young people.
i prefer theta because i will travel with my wife and she always prefers theta kind of accommodation.
the advertisement said theta they would be available but they were not.
she told everyone theta i fancy him and everybody always makes a joke of it. theta makes me feel so embarrassed: i was very angry at theta time!
i had to explain to everybody theta i actually didn't have a girlfriend. i explained to them theta it was a good possibility, nothing else, but no one believed me, because pat had told them theta i had an actual girlfriend.
theta means theta there are more and more big supermarkets and big stores, where no one has time for you to help you or explain things to you such as what kind of bicycle is the best for you, no one to talk to and no one to complain to.
a huge queue theta lasts half an hour or more and finishes with you completely freaked out.
therefore, i will suggest theta we all Nov to keep the environment clean and healthy for the next generation.
the main advantage is theta it provides you with all the information theta you need.
all my family liked the films and the plays theta there were very much, but i personally think theta it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
about the accommodation, i would like you to take careful consideration of the fact theta i am asthmatic, so i would appreciate it if you could reserve a bed in a log cabin.
people believe theta the bird was sent from heaven.
have you noticed theta all the classic gentlemen wear the same type of suit?
i was promised theta the star was Danny Brock but when i was there i saw another star theta was completely different from your brochure.
amazingly, we can find theta there are more and more computer users.
i think theta people will be as alone and jealous as today.
unfortunately, i was very disappointed to find out theta there were no discounts available!
at first i was irritated theta contrary to your announcements no discounts were available.
Sarah looked at him for a while, then she stood in front of the class and explained to the others theta she had won a prize for 20 people to travel for 1 week to the coast of southern France and every one of the 19 pupils was invited, except pat who wasn't very good at keeping secrets.
you wrote theta your cousin is quite interested in magic, detectives and sport, didn't you? i think this is the best choice for him!
in theta instance we don't enjoy shopping because we can't find what we are looking for and we have a bad time in the shopping centre.
theta is why i think theta modern technology helps me in my daily life.
hello! i am very pleased theta i have won the first prize in your competition and i want to tell you theta it would be better for me to go to your camp in July because theta month i usually have a rest and now i am thinking about it.
every day scientists and technologists discover and produce more and more new things and theta is good. it has to be like theta, we have to go forward not backward from the point where we are now.
another thing was theta there were no discounts available, and theta the restaurant, which i wanted to visit after the show, was closed because of the main cook sickness.
i am writing to thank you for your letter confirming theta i won the first prize in your competition.
one of the reasons theta i have visited your arts festival was to see a lot of plays. in the future, i hope to be an actress and theta's why i want to learn something from the professionals.
it wasn't a "perfect evening out" like you said in the advertisement, so my friends and i would be grateful if you would give us some money back, if theta is possible.
the third problem was theta it was written theta discounts were available, but when i got there it was not true.
after theta we have to make sure theta we explain about the relationship between teachers and students, showing the times theta we have been out together.
i am writing to give you the information theta you asked me for.
theta is very nice theta all costs are paid for but i would like to ask you how much money i should take with me because i do not know anything about prizes in the US's. and please tell me if i need anything to paint because it would be difficult to take it with me, so if i will need to take everything i will just change this activity.
i think it was very clever of me to record theta moment which i will never ever forget, and theta was the thing theta i liked most about theta experience.
the advertisement said theta the show would start at W but it started at W.
i had to keep things in place and check theta the microphones were working properly.
secondly, i believe you should know theta a lot of people, including me, were not able to enjoy the concerts because some concert halls were too small.
students think theta we don't do anything and we don't learn anything special.
in answer to your question, i will have to say theta i can only go to the camp in July because of my job; they only gave me theta month off.
again we're so sorry theta we are causing you inconvenience regarding your plan and thank you for considering us.
anyway, i really enjoyed helping at a pop concert last month so theta I'd like to write about it!
what i most appreciated was theta they gave me their latest CD with their signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, I've given one to you.
finally, we would like to get your permission to go. maybe if it is possible theta you can change your programmer, we can go to your college any time after Tuesday.
I'm pleased to receive your letter and really happy theta i won the first prize.
when i was a child i was afraid of all these little insects theta live in the ground and this fear still remains now.
in my opinion, in a hundred years we'll wear the same kind of clothes theta we wear nowadays.
i had doubts when somebody said theta the fashion of the future would be different.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so theta when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
but when i hear the word future, i have an image of metallic colours so theta in my imagination they are wearing metallic or brightly coloured clothes.
then, i was forced to wait fortifier minutes to see the show because it started at W instead of W and, when it finally started, i was really disappointed to see theta the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it had said in the advertisement.
in the advertisement you wrote "your perfect evening out", theta's very funny.
i cannot imagine living without television, it is something theta we need for our education, and for getting news and other helpful information.
it's not theta problem theta there was no more discount available i had chosen it, because I'm (allowed?).
at theta time, i took the course which covered all the 4 kinds of strokes.
this book helps us to improve our logic, mind, and memory and it teaches the reader not to lie, to be more honest with other people and pay attention to the smallest details in our life because sometimes theta can help us very very much.
the real thing was theta i had to look after them because without me they would have been lost.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes theta i could need and the sort of people theta i will find there.
thirdly, in your advertisement it said theta discounts would be available, but they were not.
concerning the accommodation's be informed theta i would prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i think theta the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities have chosen tennis and photography.
despite the fact theta i felt exhausted i must admit theta it was one of the days i will never forget throughout my whole life
we could immediately see theta it was broken.
now i can tell you theta it was an amazing challenge for me because i had never done anything like theta.
so, theta afternoon at lunchtime, i went into the teachers 'room and opened her desk and took the paper out quietly and calmly.
I'd like to say something theta i felt during the festival, and give my opinions theta would be helpful for you to prepare for the next festival.
after theta they changed the principal actor, the one theta replaced him was very bad, theta made us really angry.
to answer your next question, i would rather stay in a log cabin. the thing is, i have a phobia about insects and my doctor recommended theta i should sleep in an enclosed area.
the advertisement says theta Danny brook and Tina truelove would play but in this show there were totally different actors and theta was really disappointing because i was looking forward to them.
it's all right, but i also think theta he's exaggerating.
theta show wasn't what it was supposed to be and it is for theta reason theta i am writing to you.
first of all, when i paid my entrance fee they didn't accept my discount ticket, they told me theta the ticket was fake, then i entered the theatre and i had to wait 45 minutes. the show was supposed to start at W and it started at W, "this shows a lack of respect".
at work my particular job involves two standard PCs with specific software plus one workstation with the Stanford university network (sun) operating system and a special computer theta my firm is now developing.
firstly, i must say theta I'll be able to have two weeks free only in July, since i have started work and am entitled to have a holiday only in July.
apart from theta i wouldn't mind at all whether i stay in tents or log cabins but if i have to choose between these two I'd prefer to stay in tents because they give me a nice feeling of relaxation. it is very unusual to stay in log cabins while you are camping.
in the advertisement it was clearly written theta Danny brook and Tina truelove would play the main roles.
secondly, i would prefer to stay in a log cabin, because i am allergic to some insects theta might get in a tent.
in conclusion most of the time theta you spend shopping you put a lot of effort into choosing things and making decisions and they are more or less important, or more or less enjoyable depending on what, why, where and who is the person theta you are interested in pleasing.
there is only one bad thing, theta this festival was too short.
the machine theta was used for reading this card was very big, you used to need a room for the computer.
i advise finishing with a chemistry lesson so theta people see the laboratory.
I'm writing this letter to you to make a complaint about the musical show "over the rainbow" which i saw yesterday. i have to say theta I'm very disappointed with what i saw because after seeing your advertisement i expected more. the show was entirely different to what it says in the advertisement.
i am writing in order to complain about the show theta your theatre put on.
you know, you have to very strongly when you have to do theta because when people came in they couldn't wait to get to the front and they try to go through very quickly.
in conclusion, from my point of view, people must learn theta despite technology being such a new area to explore, we have to use it with a great deal of responsibility for us all to survive in the future.
so, after all of theta, i wanted to have a nice relaxing dinner in your restaurant. i was very angry when i appeared in front of closed doors and there was a notice theta the restaurant wasn't open.
i was very pleased theta the main actors listed on the advertisement were Danny brook and Tina truelove.
all of the students-including Mesolithic of this as a great opportunity theta it would be a pity to miss, especially when students can enter for free.
the aim of this report is to give some information about the new Acapulco resort buildings which were built 10 years ago. they are some of the first buildings theta were built with the latest technology and designed by an important Mexican architect.
as it is said in the advertisement the show starts at 19.30 but i had to stay outside for 45 minutes, because according to the programmer it started at 20.15, but theta is not the end of the story; in your advertisement it is clearly said theta you have discounts available on tickets. theta was not true!
i received your letter and I'm very happy because i didn't expect it, so first of all i want you to know theta i really fancy going to camp California in the US's. for two weeks, especially because I've never been to this country.
this is just a note to confirm for you theta i have received your letter.
but soon everyone in the class was looking at me smilingly and i found out theta i had many unsuspected friends... not long after, they were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed going shopping, others going to the cinema and a restaurant.
i am writing in order to express my disappointment at the show "over the rainbow", performed 2 weeks ago; first of all, i read in the advertisement theta Danny brook was to act in the show, but the actor theta really played was a different one, and this was very disappointing.
in conclusion, I'd like to recommend theta you should first know what you have to offer and then advertise it.
if you compare the fashion now with theta of 100 years ago, you'll notice theta there are incredibly big differences between them.
so i want you to send me some money back for theta unpleasant night.
yeah folks, theta was the point i got interrupted by my parents in this beautiful dream, but if you want to hear the end of my story than buy the "rossall-school-magazine", next issue, and you will hear the end of this unbelievable story.
theta Wednesday pat phoned me and told me theta sally also loved Paul.
this problem with pat had a lot of consequences, because i had a very heavy discussion with her about it. it was so heavy theta one of our teachers had to calm me down, because i was very angry with her.
i had to explain to everybody theta i actually didn't have a girlfriend. i explained to them theta it was a good possibility, nothing else, but no one believed me, because pat had told them theta i had an actual girlfriend.
it means theta every day except Sunday we have four lessons and each of the lessons lasts for an hour and a half and it means a "double lesson".
i have received your exciting letter, informing me theta i have won two weeks at camp California in the USA.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of money theta I'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
the organizer of the tour spoke with me and asked me if i wanted to do the same work in two months at the rolling stones concert isn't theta fantastic!
i asked her for help and she promised me she would do everything theta she could and keep my secret.
when i received your advertisement concerning the show "over the rainbow" i thought theta I'd have a great evening, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment for me.
i think it was very clever of me to record theta moment which i will never ever forget, and theta was the thing theta i liked most about theta experience.
first of all, i was surprised theta Danny brook and Tina truelove did not perform.
i hope theta this will clarify your questions and doubts.
we would like to believe theta shopping is the most wonderful part of our life.
I'm quite sure theta people all around the world will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people, especially women, who like to be very elegant and beautiful, will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and theta's it.
new fabrics create new textures, all kinds of accessories are added to create new versions, to refresh old ideas, to make new proposals theta will last, as always, just a few weeks.
for example, a car, which is used by everyone every day, changed my daily life in the sense theta i don't need my dad or my mum to go skating or to go to work. i can do it by myself and for me it is important not only because of technology, but because i can show theta i am responsible.
her parents have been so upset theta they have asked the school to help their child and theta is the reason why I'm writing this story.

we started to put everything on the stage and after this we realized theta the band was coming onto the stage near us.
I'm quite sure theta people all around the world will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people, especially women, who like to be very elegant and beautiful, will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and theta's it.

i had always dreamt of being near "the cranberries", but i had never thought theta the dream could become reality.

well on march 11th there was a group here in Brazil called "Los jaguars", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favourites and as you know i have a cousin theta works as an organizer for all the bands theta would like to have a concert in Brazil and when my cousin knew theta my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
this activity of shopping has become one of our most important, after all, we go shopping for any reason, we have developed such an instinct for shopping theta we can proudly say theta we are some sort of kings of the urban jungle.

at first i was surprised but a few seconds later, when i realised theta i wasn't allowed to go, i tried to persuade my teacher to let me go.
not only these subjects are studied by us, but also Latin, Russian, Ukrainian, biology and physical training, but as we study them we understand theta they are not so important as our main subjects.
i am writing to you about an injure theta i had at your last musical at the circle theatre.
but i had a big surprise when i saw theta it was a different actor, and i was very disappointed.
but not everything about technology and computers is good, because many people, and me in a control way, have become computers 'and technology's slaves, and we cannot do anything without a machine, and i am not saying theta it's wrong or bad, and i accept theta they make our daily tasks easier, but we have to maintain our independence as humans.
i knew theta my brother was at home, although i didn't know where he was.
and the best thing is theta it entertains me alone or with people.
in the hope theta you understand me.
i appreciate the opportunity theta you are giving me and I'm very grateful to you guys.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling theta is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine their face clearly.
you cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised theta the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and theta the restaurant was closed because of repair work; as a matter of fact, after the show we only ate a hamburger in a flatfoot restaurant.
I've just received your letter, and i must say theta i am so surprised. i wasn't expecting to win it.
last week i received your letter in which you told me theta i won first prize.
he told me theta it was necessary to do something about it.
as i am specially fond of musicals, i even travel abroad to see what's new, i am probably one of your most devoted customers. i know this word is not the best but you have demonstrated theta the theatre can be just as cold as any other business.
science and technology can be useful: see for example the use of TV in the school or the use of the radio to learn a foreign language or the use of the computer to get further information about something theta interests you.
so one day she invited me to come to her house at night and to do so i had to run away from our boarding house and theta was illegal.
because of everything i have said i am more likely to think theta the benefits of people's inventions are much greater than all their disadvantages.

first i think theta in the future we are going to wear fewer clothes because the climate is going to get warmer and warmer.
firstly, i should say theta i would like to travel in July because theta is the month which i could most likely have off from work to go on holiday.
it all started when pat, nick's best friend, wanted to have the party at his house. most of the class disagreed with theta because the pat's house is extremely little, they started to say to him theta his house was like a box.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement theta there would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe theta it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
a cabin reminds me too much of my home and is too comfortable. theta isn't what i want to have if i stay in a wild area.
so i worked up at 2 o'clock in the morning and climbed out of the window.
i think it's because the last time i travelled (with my friends), we stayed in log cabins, and when i was sleeping i felt something moving on my skin, then i worked up frightened and when i opened my eyes, i saw lots of big ants!
first of all, I'll tell you that on the day of the concert i worked up at W AM., very early for me. you know me, I'm lazy. the work began around W. it was very hard but then the band came to rehearse. from that moment i enjoyed working until the concert had finished. the atmosphere was wonderful, the musicians were very kind to everyone who was working because they understood that putting on a concert is a job to be done by a team.
last month, i worked as a roadie at a rolling stones pop concert. i was responsible for the sound.
i worked until midnight every day.
the place where we worked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days setting up the stage, the equipment, and the lights.
it was rebuilt in 1948 because of the second world war, when it had been damaged.
the computer is our way of communicating with the outside world, whereas with aeroplanes we can reach our parents and friends easily and much faster than we would if we used boats or trains.
i know I'm a "daughter of this technological world" and unluckily i think i couldn't live without it: it's rather strange that today there's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... but, sometimes i ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one.
but the main purpose of the book is to allow you to fly with your imagination and to have a glimpse of how life is going to be in the future, when, perhaps the world will be ruled by machines.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in their education, job and their marriage in future.
but if it is difficult to forecast the developments of the fashion world, it is nearly impossible to forecast those of the common people, that is a too varied a category.
the history of the human race is the history of world conquest. that said, technology has advanced continuously since the beginning of man's evolution. furthermore, during the last two centuries, there has been an enormous technological explosion. while the xix century gave us the steam engine, factories and the electric light bulb, this century has given us nuclear energy (and sadly atomic weapons), the computer, the internet and television.
a big Buddha was built in 1997 just next to the temple, and it is the largest outdoor Buddha in the world.
we all think the programmer is organised well. in particular we're so keen on the idea of going to the national art gallery, to see the work of the greatest painters in the world.
however, it was a disappointment when i realised that not many countries were attending the event. i would have liked to have seen more countries from all around the world, for instance, the far east, Indonesia etc.
it contributes to the world's treasure house of literature and arouses an irresistible fascination.
although the world of computers will develop day by day, i lively hope we (human beings) can maintain our way of seeing things.
finally, on the last day you have three hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now. it is up to you.
now we know, our world has developed to new world, because we have high technology to do.
first of all, we usually go to the shops at the same time as the rest of the world and that's a little bit complicated because the shops are full and it's impossible to try accurately.
i know I'm a "daughter of this technological world" and unluckily i think i couldn't live without it: it's rather strange that today there's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... but, sometimes i ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one.
i am really grateful to the people who invented the first motorcycle in the world.
because the world is now a global village people will wear at least one item of traditional or national clothing (for example a peasant jacket or hat), like they do now in rural areas from time to time.
i noticed that the artists were from only six countries instead that from around the world.
science and technology is a theme very much discussed nowadays, most of the community of our city, and of the world, where technology has arrived, confirms that it has in some way improved their way of life.
firstly, the great boom in mass communication which happened at the beginning of our decade, with the development of telephones, radio stations, television and even satellites, and of course, the internet, gave ordinary people the chance to take off on a trip all over the world, and this allowed health and education research to increase as well.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased their production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who live in third world countries.
such as a mobile phone that helps me to communicate with anyone in the world, even if i am not at home; i use a stereo if i want to listen to my favourite music; i use tapes, CDs, hairdryers, etc.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased their production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who live in third world countries.
I'm quite sure that people all around the world will be wearing very different clothes in the future because people, especially women, who like to be very elegant and beautiful, will create and invent all kinds of clothes to anybody and that's it.
in this world, where the nations fight to be the best one couldn't be different, the airplane became the most important thing in the war.
in conclusion, i can say that this is not the biggest problem that the world has and-- it is not my problem because i am not famous!
the majority have chosen history, which means a big journey around the world, either at the roman life style, or in the middle ages, when a revolution happened with deeps and new lands.
another advantage is that, for example, satellite television, which is an example of modern technology, keeps me informed about what is happening in the whole world.
i grew up through the water world and i couldn't live without it.
finally, i would be interested in meeting artists from everywhere in the world not only European artists.
we can invite stars and artists from around the world who will play and presentspresent all kinds of music like jazz, rock, classical etc.
now we know, our world has developed to new world, because we have high technology to do.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets, so without want i knew that there was going to be a concert in our city given by, from my point of view, the best group in the world, oasis.
if i want to know how a friend is, i just have to phone him; i can see how the world is getting on just by switching on the television, and i can cook in a few minutes using the microwave oven.

they can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be very good people, because "fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this world.
of course, the resources used and the manufacturing will be completely harmless for the environment because people will be more aware of the necessity of taking care of the world we live in.
but i do feel ill at ease when i see disappointed or angry assistants 'faces on leaving the magic world without any souvenirs of it!
firstly, i would like to tell you that the idea of organizing an international arts festival is fantastic, but in your advertisement it said that i would find stars and artists from around the world, when, in fact, they were from only six countries.
it's undeniable that during this century our world has been changing.
no matter that people started worried more about pollution in the world.
besides this, the information goes faster than it used to now and it's available at the same time in every part of the world.
you must have a TV because you can learn about what is happening in the world and you can see some places that you haven't been to.
the inventions of the aeroplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the world, so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day.
the world is packed with so many types of chairs, from the common wooden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others finding a basic range of prices.
so i hope the world reaches agreement about this and computer engineers have to prevent these problems because something good could be something very dangerous.
weapons are designed to kill and defend in a fight. in the second world war so many Germans were killed. also many people died in other regions,
in particular, going to the museum and the art gallery will be a great opportunity for all of us, as they are worldviews places in London.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon their lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
first the conquest of space, then computers, and now the new biotechnology's have changed, and are changing, the face of the world.
they can travel around the world, buy everything, it is a good life, but at the same time, they must be very good people, because "fame" is just for a short time, nothing lasts forever in this world.
the night he came into this world was one of grater for the inhabitants of the country and also of the town where he was born, it was an ordinary night.
what i really liked doing was helping them with their clothes and makeup, because i learnt how to do makeup for someone and i spent a few minutes with the most popular group in the world.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
since i have been travelling around the world, i would have imagined being in touch with my family or friends without the internet or my mobile phone.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that there would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but there were artists from only six countries and in my opinion there
but technology has not only changed our lives in a good way, giving us things that can make our lives more comfortable, it has also created things that aren't bad, but if they are in the hands of the wrong people they can destroy the world.
in my opinion the world itself will be different in temperature as a result of global warming, also people will become nicer, less this will take place, so the clothes will mainly be made from cotton with smooth colours like dark green or grey.
with the internet you can communicate with people in different places of the world at the same moment.
although i read that stars and artists came from around the world, i realised that they only came from six countries.
in your advertisement you mentioned that there would be artists and stars coming from all around the world, unfortunately i found out only six countries were represented.
in accordance with study or work, i use the internet, which is the easiest way to get information from all around the world.
the inventions of the aeroplane, of the train and of the car, have reduced the distances of the world, so we can go to the other side of the world in half a day.
look at the history books for W years ago, or even for the time of the first and second world wars, to see how society has changed, just because we stepped up the advance of science and technology.
computers are little things nowadays, but at the speed at which technology develops, in the next century clothes will tell our doctors about our health at any moment, any time, anywhere, people will be able to locate us around the world.
i had doubts when somebody said that the fashion of the future world be different.
since i have studied photography for several years, i world like to take some pictures of beautiful scenery in California.
i world be grateful if you could put me into the tent side of accommodation because i have had all my holidays with my parents in luxury hotels.
your advertisement mentioned that the famous Danny brook world play in this show but disappointingly it was another, unknown actor who starred instead of him.
i world prefer swimming because i really like it and i am trying to swim whenever i have got some time, and painting because i have finished a painting course and i have some practice with this.
maybe it world continue reducing in 100 years to come.
when i was 15, i was starting to look for new clothes, shoes, and everything i world find now unnecessary.
you wrote so persuasively that it world be our "perfect evening out"...
however, drawing some beautiful scenery and taking some pictures world be a very good experience for me.
i world prefer to do some climbing because that's what i Dion my spare time and i do it quite well.
i world like to travel in July because i have to go back to my country in august.
i world prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because i have been told that the Californian summer is hot and dry so, because a tent's wind circulation is better, it world create a comfortable coolness.
from the activities, i world choose painting's i am keen on and i have done several coarsened photographed which i know just the basic skills.
i and my friends world be obliged if you world give us back some of the money we paid.

in your letter, you asked me whether the book I've read world be a suitable present for your cousin's fifteenth birthday.

i world make schools less stressful, with added fun 'cause that way it's easier to learn and i world give students more chances to share their fantasies at school.
we have seen it in an advertisement and i world like to go to the show.
I'm writing to answer the questions that you sent me in the last letter, so referring to the question of when i world like to travel, i world like to go anytime during July, because i have to be back home in august, because i need to apply and get everything sorted out, to go to college next September.
i world be very grateful to receive answers to my questions.
i world prefer a tent rather than a log cabin because i have been told that the Californian summer is hot and dry so, because a tent's wind circulation is better, it world create a comfortable coolness.
i world prefer to spend the two weeks in a tent, that's, in my opinion, a way to be nearer the environment and the animals, although i don't mind staying in log cabins.
finally, i world like to ask you whether i have to prepare any special clothes for camping or will the camp provide them for me.
i have just finished a professional photography course and i world like to continue my education in this activity.
i world not really like to be a famous person, because you are not really yourself, and for me that is the most important thing.
and well, Mrs Helen, i world really appreciate it if you sent me back a letter with all the answers to my questions.
i want to suggestions for the last day. you and your group could maybe go to green park and visit the queen's house and parliament, this area is very nice and the group world enjoin after the conference to get some fresh air. another option could be the new tell gallery. i have never been there but it could be a good excuse to visit it with you.
you also mention that your show world start at 19.30 but to my knowledge it started at W and that meant fortifier minutes of waiting.
i was totally unsatisfied with the theatre and i world like to have my money back if that's possible.
i world like to know how the weather is in California during the summer so i can bring with me the appropriate clothes and the last thing i need to know is the amount of money that i have to bring with me.
about the accommodation, i world prefer a log cabin instead of a tent, because it is safer and more comfortable.
i world like to travel only in July because i world be on school holidays then and the weather is hot and the sea's temperature is less cold than in winter.
it happened last summer. we planned to go on holiday in the southern part of Thailand by motorbike but we couldn't tell our parents because they wouldn't allow us to go.
firstly, i read in the advertisement that the actor world be Danny brook, and this is one of the reasons why i went to the theatre.
concerning the accommodation's be informed that i world prefer the log cabin as in the meantime i should work on my laptop, preparing some financial reports so electricity will be needed. i think that the log cabin will be more comfortable over all. regarding two activities have chosen tennis and photography.
first of all, it world be a good thing to say that July world be the best time to travel because it is the hottest month in the year, and the weather will be really nice.
at the camp i world like to choose two activities, painting and singing. i love painting. at university i studied art for two years, but now i don't have much time to paint because i work in a bank and i have a baby.
hello! i am very pleased that i have won the first prize in your competition and i want to tell you that it world be better for me to go to your camp in July because that month i usually have a rest and now i am thinking about it.
secondly, i am interested in trying something that i have never done, so i world like to do sailing.
about the accommodation, i world prefer to stay in a log cabin rather than in a tent because i have a bad back and i think that sleeping in a tent could be not just uncomfortable but also painful for me.
i world like to inform you that Central red lion hotel has been booked for the accommodation of the group and it will be quite easy to get everywhere on foot from the hotel during your stay.
and finally, i world have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought i world go to 'theatre restaurant'.
i world like the trip to start in July if possible. because this is my holiday start at the camp California, i world like my accommodation in a tent, because i work in the army and on the camp i usually stay in a tent at night, so i will feel more comfortable.
travelling in July, i have to say, world be perfect for me because my birthday is on the 24th of that month and i wish to spend my birthday in the best way possible, so that means there.
about the accommodation, i have no problems, but i world prefer staying in a tent, so that the holiday may be more adventurous.
and finally, i world have had my dinner after this disappointing musical and thought i world go to 'theatre restaurant'.
the activities i world like to do during these two weeks are basketball and swimming.
about accommodation i world prefer a cabin, because i suffer from allergies, and i think a tent world not be very suitable for my health.
also it was said that discounts world be available, but i didn't receive any discount as you were cheating us. i know that you have a big responsibility but if you have told something to people, stick to it.
thirdly, in your advertisement it said that discounts world be available, but they were not.
i world like to write about how it has influenced my daily life.
since i have been travelling around the world, i world have imagined being in touch with my family or friends without the internet or my mobile phone.
regarding the accommodation, i world prefer to stay in tents because i think it will be closer to nature.
second, i world rather stay in a log cabin, because i tend to get very nervous in small closed places, so a tent world be inappropriate for me.
it world be a fun experience!
finally, we world like to know when you will send us the airline tickets and the brochure.
conversely, painting is an activity which i have never tried before, so i have not any skill in drawing but i world like to start doing that now when i have the chance.
finally, i world like to make one big suggestion: you should find a place for a campsite so that people who come a long way don't have to spend money on accommodation.
in fact there world be only one possibility in July because i will finish my exams at the end of that month and begin vocational training the 1st of august.
in reply to your letter received on the 13th of June, i first world like to say that it is a great pleasure for me to have been chosen.
concerning the accommodation, i world prefer to sleep in a log cabin, because to sleep in a tent world remind me of the bad experience i had in Ireland because of the weather...
i world like to ask you about the weather conditions, so i can decide on what clothes to take, and about costs, so i can make a budget for the holiday.
i world like to inform you that it was a great idea and a valuable activity as a social event.
and i world like to know if it is possible to have our money back.
when we saw your advertisement for the musical show, over the rainbow, we immediately decided that this world be a perfect evening out.
but the best thing that we do, when we go shopping is spend time having lunch at a snack bar, watching movies and playing computer games.
the media movies the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest movie famous.
that is because, i do not want to seem fussy, but i like to have some luxuries when i am going on holiday and i think sleeping on the floor without electricity may annoy me.
for those who want something more exciting and adventurous, you are recommended to visit the fun fair and amusement arcade on the top floor of the building.
i would like to ask you for vegetarian floor for me as i am a very strict vegan, and to suggest what kind of clothes to bring.
this is because people won't give up the great taste of floor. although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two.
at all schools there is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, there are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the caldera centre, which is a very special bath centre.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
there are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity. you should close the theatre until the restaurant can be used.
there are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
there were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
English: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there.
there are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
I'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're there.
on video there should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that there can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, there were none.
first of all, there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, there was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so there was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that I'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be there and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, there was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, there were only six nationalities.
with the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. we save the letter and in there weeks we could send it to another person.
I'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the there days that the class will spend in London.
basically, during there hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
in my class room smeary people stay outside London about 50% in my class room and everyone is very worried about how they can stay for there days in London.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got there buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about class rooms it very big and comfortable.
then, i was planning to buy there £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
if i find something special you will be able to visit in there hours i will call you.
those there classes are my choices. i hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for there years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
all the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for there days.
i know i will have the chance to do two activities, so i have chosen two from your list: basketball, because i have been playing it since i was eight and i have been part of a strong team for there years.
we have bought some snacks to eat and there students will sing for him, too.
there wasn't any discount available for the tickets and i went to the theatre with my there cousins from Brazil.
the band "there kings" presented a new style of music.
it was exciting looking at all there men working together and building a stage, and it was interesting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configure his computers to get the best sound possible.
coincidentally the show is in London and on Tuesday march 14, which is during the period we are in London for the thready programmer.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this thready programmer in London and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.
it took me there months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel there, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
i play the classical guitar and i also sing. i have been playing the classical guitar for there years.
i usually swim there times a week in order to maintain a back treatment which my doctor has recommended me to follow.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least there languages.
finally, on the last day you have there hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now. it is up to you.
after carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about there hours, i was exhausted.
it's a great opportunity for me to participate in your camp California because normally i work a lot and i can't spend money on travel. moreover, i have to support a big family because I'm married and i have there children.
there is no need to birther about clothes.
i got into the car and gave the jewellery in exchange for my birther, took him and left the place.
a century ago, when a farmer took the horses out of the stable and put the plough behind them, we've got the word "time".
horses will only be more modern and more practical but not very different from our homes in the present.
i realised that my bag was outside and i went out to look for it, when a shower of stones covered the entrance of the Hill.
the computer was invented 30 years or more ago and started processing information with a big card which was perforated and made a small Hill and each Hill meant something like a code.
the computer was invented 30 years or more ago and started processing information with a big card which was perforated and made a small Hill and each Hill meant something like a code.
the memorial Hill is surrounded by large playgrounds.
during the afternoon, Tim and i spent the hours before the concert lying in the park next to the sports Hill where the concert was to be held.
but the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the "London fashion and leisure show", which will take place in the central exhibition Hill, London, on Tuesday march 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. at the same time we have to go to the science museum but we would all like to go to the show.
red hot chili peppers came here for a short time and they played at the "Medicaid hall".
-check your wallet and if you have enough money (a very small amount) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like chili, Cuba, Zambia, and morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer low wages for Ismael jobs.. you might enjoy your summer holidays and find yourself
also i think clothes will have Manet gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution's think there will be Manet such places in a hundred yearned a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
these days, we're surrounded with so Manet different kinds of products which our ancestors invented.
sometimes, there are so Manet people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
furthermore, it is possible to treat Manet patients who have serious diseases more effectively, if we use modern technology in medical science.
considering my whole life i can say that modern technology has changed my daily life in Manet ways.
the festival was excellent in Manet ways, and in particular it being an international festival was a challenging, but brilliant idea.
how has modern technology changed my daily life? i think that technology has changed my life and everybody's life in Manet ways.
it is something very special. its ceiling is made from Manet small pieces of wood. its windows with Manet colours. it is fantastic.
i would like to know how Manet people will stay with me in the tent, and do i have to take with me any special clothes for surfing.
thank you very much for the Manet interesting positions in this schedule, especially the river trip to Greenwich, which, we are sure, will be very exciting.
i did not have a perfect evening with so Manet problems.
we saw almost all kinds of skirts, trousers, coats, skirts and even hat's until now have been the main point of Manet fashion creatures.
so if you visit Paris, the Pompadour centre is a very interesting building to visit, even if in Paris there are Manet other buildings.
why have so Manet people been infected by this "psychological virus"?
after that you have to wait a long time in the queue to pay and Manet times it isn't possible to pay with your credit card and you don't have any money in cash.
for example, there were some concert halls which were too small to hold so Manet people, the stars and artists were just from six countries, which is not enough for the audience.
about the gyms, i like them very much. those places have so Manet machines that you can easily lose weight and develop a wonderful body.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too Manet people.
this is something that has troubled Manet people, especially those who work in the fashion industry.
we can hardly imagine life without computers, TV sets, microwaves, and so Manet other things, and yet none of these things existed seventy years ago.
anyway everybody should do shopping as people need to eat, need clothes and Manet other important things to live.
there are Manet facts to prove that shopping is not "pretty and harmonious", so believe me, it is not always enjoyable.
next year, you should calculate or examine how Manet people will come before you choose a hall, which i feel very good was plays and films.
there are so Manet monuments in California and so i will remember this holiday with my photographs.
but not everything about technology and computers is good, because Manet people, and me in a control way, have become computers 'and technology's slaves, and we cannot do anything without a machine, and i am not saying that it's wrong or bad, and i accept that they make our daily tasks easier, but we have to maintain our independence as humans.
the second is nuclear weapons and the Manet wars in which modern equipment is used.
to summarize, the modern technologies give you and allow you to do Manet things which would be impossible in the past but also creates Manet problems.
going shopping is a good thing when you don't know what else to do but it also has Manet disadvantages.
weapons are designed to kill and defend in a fight. in the second world war so Manet Germans were killed. also Manet people died in other regions,
we were thinking is so Manet other activities to relax and enjoy ourselves then sunbathing on the beach.
although there are new machines etc, medicine makes Manet discoveries thanks to research into different diseases in order to make the population live longer.
weapons are designed to kill and defend in a fight. in the second world war so Manet Germans were killed. also Manet people died in other regions,
i had a very disappointing evening because of Manet things.
Manet different incurable diseases have appeared.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where Manet new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for their cars, motorbikes or computers.
on the one hand scientists have discovered a lot of medicines for different illnesses, but on the other hand they discovered Manet illnesses which we hadn't heard about before.
what is more, there are Manet new ways to produce medicines and modern hospital equipment.
but soon everyone in the class was looking at me smilingly and i found out that i had Manet unsuspected friends... not long after, they were asking me to buy a coffee or lunch for them; some proposed going shopping, others going to the cinema and a restaurant.
and it is responsible for Manet changes in my life, and i think i wouldn't be able to live without it anymore.
another exciting subject which most of the students like very much is PE. Manet students like to play sports.
but where is the bad part of it? well shopping can became horrible at Christmas for example, when hundreds of people go to the shopping centre and it also can cause Manet problems when you become an impulsive buyer.
i went inside to ask about that package but they told me that it was gone, so, i went to Manet shops just to get the same answer.
on the other hand, playing games and using a computer widens my brain so, as you can see, this modern stuff has got Manet advantages and disadvantages.
more and more people buy mobile phones, because they are very useful, you get a lot of possibilities like: using the internet, buying different goods, booking tickets, controlling your home techno and Manet others.
the world is packed with so Manet types of chairs, from the common wooden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others finding a basic range of prices.
this is not the first time i have been to your theatre and i have to tell you i have enjoyed Manet other plays, but be sure "over the rainbow" will be the last one.
we appreciated the modern technology changed my daily life for help every easy and quickly, we have time to do Manet things.
there are Manet things that can go wrong in the process of acquiring a product or service.
it is something very special. its ceiling is made from Manet small pieces of wood. its windows with Manet colours. it is fantastic.
this is also a very big disadvantage because Manet people are losing their jobs.
this choice doesn't give Manet artists the opportunity to express themselves.
there are Manet ways to earn money, especially in a big city, like the one where we are studying all year around.
despite being used in Manet ways, it could entertain us as well.
it gives us knowledge useful for Manet school clubs, like the "marathon shell" club or the robotics club.
first of all, as i see it the idea of an arts festival is great because in this way Manet people can get to know artists who come from different countries.
i can spend so Manet hours because day by day i discover new things.
I'd like to know how much money, and how Manet clothes we need.
actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! i, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as there were so Manet magnificent events.
modern technology saves us a lot of time and brings us Manet benefits when we use it in the right way, but some bad way to EEG. send virus to break down network.
you can't imagine how Manet people are involved in the organization of a concert. apart from the musicians and the singers, there are people who work with lights, who organize the security... it was so exciting!
it helps me when i study. i can find Manet things on the internet or write my compositions on it.
lastly, there is a recycling problem, which Manet people do not care about.
Manet years ago, more or less seventy years ago a young man, with an excellent capacity for thinking and inventing things, started building a big thing called a "time machine".
Manet years ago people didn't have an opportunity to use all these things and they had to work a lot.
fourthly, that product is too expensive for you and the last problem is you buy too Manet things but you have not got your own car so you have to carry big boxes by yourself.
when i go to bed, because there are Manet mosquitoes, i turn on a special machine with a berrylike thing in it which kills them.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in Manet people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (i am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choice).
maybe they will be in Manet colours and they will be very tight.
another point that i want to complain about is the time that the musical was supposed to start (W) but it started at W, so there was major dissatisfaction with that, but the last and worst thing was that your theatre restaurant was closed because the British health institute considered your food unhealthy, and i am not taking into consideration Manet other points like unsatisfactory service, and uncomfortable seats.
after helping to do that and Manet other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands.
I'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out there are Manet challenges in your new career.
modern technology has changed my life in Manet different ways:
also i think clothes will have Manet gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution's think there will be Manet such places in a hundred yearned a hat designed to protect people from the strong rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
i recently had a week's holiday in London, and, during my stay, i went to your theatre to see "over the rainbow" because i had seen an advertisement for this show and i was really interested in seeing it for Manet reasons, one of the reasons is that i love the star, Danny brook.
it may, in Manet cases, not be true but we can suspect that most of them wanted to become a celebrity and they had to know there is no private life inseparably connected to it.
to summarize, the modern technologies give you and allow you to do Manet things which would be impossible in the past but also creates Manet problems.
this technology has helped in Manet fields, like medicine, entertainment, work and other things, so it has obviously changed the lives of Manet people.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the centre of the town because there are Manet places to have a look at and go shopping.
the people who will attend the party include Manet professors, professors and faculties.
humans have done Manet things through the years and made Manet things possible.
however, it was a disappointment when i realised that not Manet countries were attending the event. i would have liked to have seen more countries from all around the world, for instance, the far east, Indonesia etc.
lastly, i would like to know how Manet people are coming to the camp i will go to.
also some concert halls were too small for this Manet people.
nowadays we have Manet big shopping centres.
in a supermarket, shop or department store they have Manet things.
about the TV. i spend Manet hours in front of the TV. it helps me to relax and spend some hours alone.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there Manet interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
as you offer Manet activities it was hard to choose which ones i want to do, but i decided to take swimming and photography, because i am very good at swimming and because i am currently attending a photography course in Vienna.
there are so Manet varieties of products, different prices, different qualities.
the telephone is a very important invention if we can use it correctly without using it as a type of entertainment as Manet people do nowadays.
this technology has helped in Manet fields, like medicine, entertainment, work and other things, so it has obviously changed the lives of Manet people.
although modern technology gives you Manet comfortable things for living, can it give you nature, peace and fresh air?
for those students who are very interested in shopping, clothes shops, jewellery, stationery, bookshops, fashion and beauty departments and Manet more are available.
is there only one teacher for each sport, and how Manet are in each group?
there are also Manet kinds of takeaway restaurants, where i can taste my favourite foods.
because everyone has different thinking like Beverley centre if you go there every day or every week for shopping you will get very bored because sometimes there are too Manet people everywhere, like in the restaurants and shops.
fortunately, there are Manet ways to earn some money nowadays.
modern technology helps people in Manet ways and is indispensable.
in spite of that fact there are of course Manet families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve their problem all together.
humans have done Manet things through the years and made Manet things possible.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because there are Manet different kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on makeup and how to have appropriate hairstyles.
nowadays a simple thing like a computer includes so Manet possible ways of destroying different environmental compartments.
that's so good when you have the money to enjoy it but, apart from that, there are Manet problems.
these days we are very interested in space and the millennium and things and Manet designers have shown millennium looks recently.
besides, i really would like to know approximately how much Manet i should take with me.
i am very indignant because i wasted my time and it was a horrible evening so i would like you to return my Manet and take note of all these problems.
after that you have to wait a long time in the queue to pay and many times it isn't possible to pay with your credit card and you don't have any Manet in cash.
definitely, it was a very disappointing evening and i would appreciate it if it is possible to have my Manet back.
and please tell me how much Manet i am supposed to need excluding transport and accommodation.
you can imagine how disappointed i felt after that evening, and i am writing to ask you for a refund of part of the Manet.
i don't know what type of clothes i have to take or the amount of Manet that I'm going to spend, so if you, please, could help me by giving me this information i would be very pleased.
oh I'm getting mad again so i am going to tell you one last thing, it was the most horrible night i had ever had so i demand my Manet back!
i had put some Manet aside for that month, thinking about the discount, but when i went to buy them they said that discounts were not available.
when i have enough Manet the price isn't important, then i can buy a lot of things without considering my Manet.
and i want to know how much Manet i have to bring for personal expenses.
and in conclusion i want you to give me my Manet back, (i still have the advertisement if you want proof of what i say).
we had prepared this quite a long time ago, this trip to the capital and saved a lot of Manet as well.
often people can't buy a piece of bread. and they ask for Manet from other people.
of course, you should give a refund for the Manet spent, not only to me but to all the audience.
for example, how much pocket Manet will be enough and what kind of clothes i should wear.
also shopping makes people happier by costing a lot of Manet and it even influences the economic situation more flexibly.
sometimes you can stay out all day just to buy a present for someone. it starts in the morning, and of course you have breakfast somewhere, and it gets later and you are still looking for it, so you have lunch, and finally you spend more Manet than you thought you would.
since i am going to travel i would like to know how much Manet it would be advisable to take and what kind of clothing i should take.
i will be glad if you will send my Manet back.
and because of these circumstances, i would like to have a part of my Manet back.
is it necessary to bring any Manet?
for all these reasons, and if you want to keep me as a customer, i would be grateful if you gave me some or all of my Manet back.
after all the inconvenience that made me feel really mad. i think i can only forgive your theatre if you give me a refund of the Manet i spent there, and some more for all the problems i had.
they are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because they cannot stop themselves unless they have not got Manet to spend.
pat was my big brother, who had heard of some people paying, "sideman", but never know the reason, until he found a large amount of Manet in my room.
so, because of the things i have mentioned, i think i should be given some Manet back.
and i want to know more about the Manet. can you give me more information about the Manet that i need to bring with me?
finally i would like to ask you about i have to spent any Manet over there without my shopping and how the weather is over there in July because i will pack the clothes as useful.
the principal reason I'm writing to you at the moment is that i want my Manet back, because i felt so disappointed with the theatre and also with the play.
to cut a long story short, because of everything i have said above, the correct thing for me to do is to ask for my Manet back, and for you it is just to give it back to me because of all the trouble and disappointment you have made me suffer.
could you please tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses Manet to spend?
i was totally unsatisfied with the theatre and i would like to have my Manet back if that's possible.
it was not my 'perfect evening out', as your advertisement said it would be, and i would like some Manet back.
i thought you were a good theatre, where people can go and have a good evening alone or with somebody else, but really i am very disappointed and i want to ask for my Manet back.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their Manet, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my Manet back's bank account number is enclosed.
so i would be grateful if you paid for a full refund of the Manet i spent on the tickets.
in the end, i asked for i Manet back (and payment for my horrible night): do you think anybody will give me something back?!
and i would like a refund. you have wasted my evening and Manet.
finally i would like to ask you if i need any Manet, because you say all accommodation and travel costs are paid for.
pat was my big brother, who had heard of some people paying, "sideman", but never know the reason, until he found a large amount of Manet in my room.
i thought you understood '; please send Manet back to me, you know why, don't answer me?
regarding accommodation, i would prefer to have a log cabin. it would be better to leave Manet or anything in without worrying about theft. I've always dreamed about climbing but i have never had the opportunity to try this sport.
i was very disappointed and i would like to have my Manet back.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more Manet than ever before, and some women don't earn Manet. they have no idea how difficult it is to earn Manet.
but even without Manet to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in their showrooms.
I'm extremely happy because not only do i earn a lot of Manet but also I'm learning a lot.
first of all i would like to travel only in July because i am going to work in august to earn Manet and after that (from September to June) i go to university as usual.
however, shopping sometimes makes them stressed. people often waste Manet on worthless things.
i would be grateful if you could send me further information about details like how much Manet or what kind of clothes I'll have to take with me.
well, it seems that it wasn't my perfect evening and for all these reasons i demand to have my Manet back, i wasted £ 20 to see a show which doesn't respect the programmer i paid for.
these days people prefer shopping at supermarkets rather than at shops or even shopping centres, because shopping at a shop is less enjoyable and you spend the same amount of Manet.
and now i request my Manet back.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more Manet than ever before, and some women don't earn Manet. they have no idea how difficult it is to earn Manet.
far from the strength that doing a sport or even going to work requires, going shopping is something you can do either on your own or with all your family and it could not be easier; you only need a good pair of shoes and a wallet full of Manet.
finally I've got a question: what clothes must i bring with me and how much Manet?
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full price, at the end of the season it is half price. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of Manet for their clothes.
so try to imagine my situation. i had paid a lot of Manet and i didn't see a good show. i am really disappointed.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the Manet they get from advertisements, reports about their last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
in addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £ 10. this was excellent. it meant people only spent pocketing, and then they could watch all the events at the weekend. for them it is a really economical way to spend their weekend.
to sum up, there is no perfect job, and being famous involves a lot of Manet, but also a lot of journalists following your private life.
I'd like to know how much Manet, and how many clothes we need.
it is true, they deserve to have a private life without journalists following them all the time, however this publicity brings them Manet, and a comfortable life.
and how much Manet i should take?
finally i would like to ask you for some further information about the clothes and the Manet we will need.
nevertheless, i lost my concentration on my studies and i spent the Manet on entertainment.
because of this, the least you can do for us is to give me my Manet back and work hard so that this theatre, which is famous for its beauty and punctuality doesn't become famous for its disorganised shows.
finally, i would like to ask you whether there is anything i should bring on this trip such as specific clothes, extra Manet etc.
with all the dissatisfaction above, therefore, i would like to ask for some of my Manet back as my evening was not what it should have been.
when all the Manet had gone from a bank, nobody was there except pat.
a lot of Manet is involved in research to stop the increase in levels of pollution.
it would be great if you considered returning my Manet as soon as possible.
some people think that going shopping can keep you away from depression. you can enjoy your time spending all the Manet you have, buying clothes, jewellery, furniture, etc.
if you could give me some of my Manet back that would be a great apology for the waste of time and my disappointment.
-check your wallet and if you have enough Manet (a very small amount) you can arrange a trip to reach countries like Chile, Cuba, Zambia, and morocco where people (poorer than you) will offer low wages for Ismael jobs.. you might enjoy your summer holidays and find yourself
I'd like you to send the Manet to this address: UL Galloway 10
i had not any Manet for travelling and my parents were going to give me some only if i had concrete plans.
we hadn't enough Manet to buy food or new clothes and the worst was that my youngest brother was terribly ill, and without Manet we couldn't take him to a doctor.
in my opinion you have to give some Manet back to me.
definitely, it was not my perfect evening at all and under these circumstances i really believe you should give me my Manet back.
i think you realise why I'm writing this letter to ask you to give me my Manet back.
i look forward to hearing from you in the very near future, to offer me my Manet back.
i would like to know how much Manet people usually take and how much clothing.
also there is a big problem: the Manet.
however, we decided to have the job, because of good Manet.
however, things which you can get with Manet do not necessarily fill your dissatisfaction or even as you buy something more and more, your emptiness might be greater.
actually most people work hard to earn their Manet and consequently, the occasion on which this Manet is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
when i have enough Manet the price isn't important, then i can buy a lot of things without considering my Manet.
this actor was not nearly as brilliant as Danny brook and i would not have paid so much Manet if i had known this before.
it is finally your turn and you reluctantly hand the Manet over to the hypocritical cashier.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for their Manet, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my Manet back's bank account number is enclosed.
she spent the Manet on a magazine.
eventually i like shopping too and i believe everybody likes shopping, but before you buy something think first and you will not have any problems after that and the most important thing is make sure you have enough Manet to survive.
for men and women appearance is important and they spend a lot of Manet buying clothes, cosmetics, accessories, jewellery etc.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more Manet than ever before, and some women don't earn Manet. they have no idea how difficult it is to earn Manet.
definitely, i want my Manet back as soon as possible.
actually most people work hard to earn their Manet and consequently, the occasion on which this Manet is spent to buy something useful, or simply something they like, should be considered a very pleasant occasion.
that's so good when you have the Manet to enjoy it but, apart from that, there are many problems.
lastly, can you please tell me how much Manet would be appropriate to take?
summing up, you might have realised that that wasn't "my perfect evening out" which you promised, so i would like you to give me the Manet i paid for the ticket back.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much Manet i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is during this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
so i want you to send me some Manet back for that unpleasant night.
i ask you to transfer Manet into this account.
if we decide to buy something special and we have enough Manet for it we have to go and buy it.
by using the interest we can make new pen friends overseas, and create clubs and societies.
also the interest has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
famous people have always been the centre of interest for a number of people.
firstly, the English lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interest in studying and improving their knowledge.
i also like surfing. i think it is a dangerous sport, but i know how to do it, because of the fact that last year a professional surfer taught me.
not only was i a member of the swimming team in our school, but also i had been taught by my father since i was five years old.
as regards painting, i know a lot about it since my grandmother taught me when i was five years old.
i met a lot of different people and they all taught me something new about behaviour or compassion.
they taught me specially.
after a few seconds of taught i went straight to pat. "why, why did you do that?"
i taught that Danny brook, who is my favourite actor, would perform in that show.
and when we understood the internet, we taught that meeting people from other countries and being able "to chat" with them was the height of technology.
as you know, we are in England to learn your language and also to learn about your lifestyle, and we taught this show would be a good opportunity for us to discover this aspect of your country!
i taught i would never need a mobile phone, but my mum and dad gave me one for Christmas last year and now i can't live without it!
i had a Nivea experience as manager too.
I'm not keen on liars, Mr smith, and i think that you've lied to Nivea tourists like us: some brilliant actors were supposed to play the parts and we only had different, pitiful ones.
if i feel like tailing to a friend i just have to call him and wherever he is i will be able to get through to him.
yesterday morning, i went to the toilet. i overheard two people tailing about my son. i felt sorry for myself and i burst into tears. i quickly got out of the toilet.
suddenly, an enormous sadness caught me, because Philip had begged me not to tell anyone, so he would definitely break up with me, and i knew i was going to stop tailing to pat, because she had just ruined my happiness and i couldn't trust her anymore.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't matter where you are (i am tailing about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choice).
what a great idea to invite writers! i really liked tailing with them.
the thing i really liked was helping the artists and tailing to them.
anyway, this is not always necessarily a problem, but it can be a big thing for the famous person, because it gets people tailing about him and increases his popularity.
if we are tailing about accommodation then accommodation in tents would be great's love being close to nature.

we are in the age of technological development, of that Thar can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, Thar were none.
first of all, Thar are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, Thar was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying Thar with her new mysterious lover.

when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be Thar and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.

from Thar to the conference you have to take the number 50 bus, which stops near the hotel and arrives in the town centre.
then, i was planning to buy three £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that Thar were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
actually, the price of the weekend ticket was excellent! i, myself, was expecting a more expensive ticket as Thar were so many magnificent events.
the activities listed in your letter all seemed to be interesting. i chose to play basketball (i play in a club, i am quite good) and to do photography (Thar must be beautiful pictures to take in California).

for the accommodation at camp California, i would prefer to have a log cabin because i think it is more comfortable than a tent, and in case Thar is a big storm with heavy rain. a log cabin's more resistant than a tent.
it's quite difficult for me because Thar are 4 of them i like a lot, which are climbing, tennis, surfing and photography, but if i have to make a choice, i choose climbing and surfing.
to make matters worse, we have never had the opportunity to see Danny brook because, instead, Thar was a different actor!
finally i want to find out if Thar is a supermarket near the campsite and if Thar are any facilities for washing my clothes on the camp.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in their house because Thar aren't convenient appliances in their houses yet.
i don't know much about the weather down Thar, in California, so i am rather puzzled about what to wear Thar.
i don't think that I'd enjoy it, all the people kicking you, you can't walk properly or buy anything. and also Thar are a lot of cases which show how people can be in shops. i mean that some people can fight to get something.
an international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die Thar were stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
the advertisement also says that Thar are discounts available but this is not true, Thar were none.

and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be Thar, my favourite actor, but Thar was someone else instead of him.
i didn't need to pay an entrance fee because i was working Thar.
what is more, you advertised Thar were discounts available but Thar were not.
Thar was a secret place where a robber kept gold stolen from a bank.

Thar were no discounts available so i overspent.
i stood at the entrance and Thar i had to check the tickets.
firstly, it was written in the advertisement that Thar would be stars and artists from around the world. i believe that it's difficult to arrange meetings with foreign stars but Thar were artists from only six countries and in my opinion Thar
and the theatre restaurant was being painted, so i could not go Thar.
it's not that problem that Thar was no more discount available i had chosen it, because I'm (allowed?).
and the best way to get from Thar to the conference is by coach, as Thar are about 35 international students, and they are all strangers here.

i am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while i am Thar. because of my studies, i will take painting, as this is the subject which i am finishing at college, always with important qualifications, and photography which has been my hobby since i discovered that i can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
first of all, Thar were no discounts available such as were promised in the advertisement so i had to pay the original price which wasn't cheap at all.

people won't wear warm clothes anymore and they will certainly be synthetic, because Thar won't be enough places to cultivate cotton and to let sheep graze.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that Danny brook would be Thar, my favourite actor, but Thar was someone else instead of him.
it was also written in the show's advertisement that Thar would be discounts available on the tickets.
finally you said Thar was a restaurant, but it was closed, so we couldn't eat anything until we got home.

before i go to the camp, i would like to know what type of clothes i need to take and whether Thar is anything i should take in case of any emergencies.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes that i could need and the sort of people that i will find Thar.

in Italy Thar aren't a lot of rules at school and they aren't very strict.

also, i want to say that the plays and films were excellent, but Thar weren't enough of them for me.
i think it is a good event and suitable for all of us because Thar are many different kinds of show, for instance latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, how to put on makeup and how to have appropriate hairstyles.

also Thar is a very good shopping centre next to the museum.

only those who get good marks can take part in these activities, so sports activities are seen as a prize, so while the students are playing basketball, tennis, volleyball... or they are swimming you can see satisfaction on Thar faces, and our volleyball team is excellent.
in the last forty years people seem to have become completely addicted to using Thar car.
what i most appreciated was that they gave me Thar latest CD with Thar signatures. marvellous thing! and of course, as you have seen, I've given one to you.
the best thing was that i have learned how to take care of Thar expensive instruments and i have sung my favourite songs with them.
nowadays the majority of people have a computer in Thar home and sometimes we ask ourselves if modern technology will change our daily life.
the churches and the cathedral are very interesting because of Thar different romantic styles.
when the show finished, we went to the restaurant and it was closed because the people who work there don't work if they don't get Thar pay first.
instead of going to the theatre, which is more cultural, or even having a picnic at Jayapura park, people prefer spending all Thar money at shopping centres.
the smokers in the school yard, the buffet and the other pupils, who are sitting at Thar tables doing Thar homework.
they can relax, reduce Thar stress and they are happy when they find the thing which they wanted.
anyway, shopping is always satisfying for rich people, because they can afford it and they don't mind paying the full price for Thar clothes.
what is important is not Thar fashion but Thar knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
because of everything i have said i am more likely to think that the benefits of people's inventions are much greater than all Thar disadvantages.
they are ready to sacrifice all Thar savings to get something that will make Thar neighbour jealous.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon Thar lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect Thar human rights.
since the electric fire and microwave oven had been invented, Thar lives have been far easier than before.
it informs people, hospitals use modern technology, and the computer helps standers and helps people do Thar job.
i had a chance to talk to them about Thar jobs and it was amazing!
this technological improvement is changing people's lives, behaviour, even Thar homes.
on the other hand, there are the ones that are also respectable but, apart from Thar relations with journalists because of Thar work, they really need to be constantly sought by photographers.
it is quite obvious that celebrities can't lead a normal life, as they are constantly followed by reporters, which makes Thar life miserable.
however, i would add that journalist's aware of that hard topical try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have Thar own private life exposed!
they are human beings and they need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in Thar lives to continue like normal people, to feel that they are unknown and anonymous and they do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time they want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
people like doing shopping (especially in Poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for Thar cars, motorbikes or computers.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money they get from advertisements, reports about Thar last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
to sum up, it is clear that not only should the film be about the subjects they study, but it should concern Thar sports activities as well.
research has shown that almost every single household owns a PC. some people use them for Thar job because they need it, but others, like children, use it just for fun.
i don't know whether it is a typical situation in the circle theatre that it promises much more then the people can get for Thar money, or whether it was on June 7 (my visit) only, but i do not approve of such a situation and must ask you for my money back's bank account number is enclosed.
there is also a gift shop in there, where your boys and girls can buy some souvenirs for Thar families and friends.
it is very interesting for me how new works, Thar possibilities.
but even without money to spend it is fun to rush from time to time through the sales that seasonally appear, or simply look at the superb displays that shops have in Thar showrooms.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend Thar leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than Thar home.
none of the groups are known at the moment, but i believe they are well on Thar way to becoming famous bands.
also, with today's machines, factories have significantly increased Thar production, which brings progress to humanity, but also, with the continuous replacement of men by machines, unemployment is increasing too, and today, it worries every single citizen of the world, specially the ones who live in third world countries.
it allowed people to enjoy Thar weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening Thar knowledge.
on the other hand, Thar stories always make them embarrassed because most of the journalists create Thar own story based on the true story just to get the people's attention.
Thar lessons are valuable, rich in knowledge and funny.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take Thar pictures, because although they are famous they also have Thar private life.
in addition to this, one weekend ticket for all the events was only £ 10. this was excellent. it meant people only spent Pokemon, and then they could watch all the events at the weekend. for them it is a really economical way to spend Thar weekend.
in 100 years, it's possible that everyone will develop his own style using all the new materials like plastic, latex, everything possible, as a way to create Thar own clothes.
peter and sue asked Francis for some help with Thar exam subjects and Francis, all week, was too busy to help them.
famous people must understand that the journalists are doing Thar job.
my main work was to take people to Thar seats because of a concert hall, which was the millennium dome.
i helped them with organizing the stage, cleaning everything, fixing what was broken and they even let me play with Thar guitars!
furthermore, most of the famous brand of sportswear companies will be at this exhibition with Thar new products for the coming season.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have Thar problems, Thar affairs, Thar private lives just as normal people do.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend Thar leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than Thar home.
for example, you go into a clothes shop, you see all those women running around trying to find the shirt that will match Thar new skirt, so they are looking everywhere, pushing you because they think that you will take the shirt that they want.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and they develop Thar own styles which suit them the most.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended Thar friendship with pat because Thar popularity was damaged.
future students could appreciate coming if they could still do Thar sport.
boys pierce Thar bodies just like girls do and vice versa.
i spent two weeks preparing the stage, speakers, backdrop, microphones, everything, with all the staff, and every night the artists came to rehearse Thar show. i could see how they really improved, and how nice they were with the staff.
on the other hand, famous people have a point if they do not allow the paparazzi to take Thar pictures, because although they are famous they also have Thar private life.
what is important is not Thar fashion but Thar knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on Thar levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have Thar wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
i carried a lot of chairs and looked after the queue or people who lost Thar way.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so real. you can imagine Thar face clearly.
about a millennium ago everything was different; people didn't have electricity, they cooked Thar food on the fire and they didn't have pens.
this is also a very big disadvantage because many people are losing Thar jobs.
in fact, now i can write to friends who live in foreign countries, for example, in the morning and receive Thar answer in the evening or even just a minute after writing.
nick and dick could prove Thar bravery stealing Thar mother's panties.
there are always, at the end of the afternoon, some weltered women coming from Thar offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
i think that the government have to protect them and Thar private life from the journalists, by punishing journalists.
pat, to win her new classmates 'friendship, told everything that she knew about her friends and, because of what pat said, her friends ended Thar friendship with pat because Thar popularity was damaged.
by the way, i have already been invited to Thar next concert.
later, when the show had finished, i stayed with the group in Thar room for a few minutes.
after helping to do that and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and hoke our hands.
then, as we were told that the show was beginning, the second hoke of the evening faced us.
my professor said, 'go and get familiar with your computer, otherwise you'll fail'.
people are used to going to the shopping centre because it is easy and familiar. it is one place where you can have lunch or dinner, watch a movie after that, and, if you want, buy something at the shops.
I'm sure you'll enjoy it and maybe become familiar with our culture.
but you could give me a chance to get more familiar with it.
she saw some familiar faces on the other side of the street.
i would prefer to stay in a tent to staying in a cabin. because it is something i feel more familiar with. i used to go camping with my family every summer.
my familiar allows me almost everything except smoking and drinking alcohol of course, which i don't do anyway.
that was a disappointment for my whole familiar. in fact all the audience were very disappointed.
i would like to going July, i don't mind which two weeks, but it has to be that month because in June i am still in school and in august i am going on holiday with my familiar.
in fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our familiar and carrying our luggage and shopping bags.
I'm writing this letter because two weeks ago i was in London and i went to the theatre to see your musical show. and through seeing it my familiar had a very disappointing evening and so did i. you can read below my point of view regarding this.
regarding the accommodation, i would be pleased to stay in a tent, because this reminds me of my holidays with my familiar.
but the situation wasn't simpler, so hill decided to discuss it with Mary, the teacher's cousin.
for that reason clothes will be simpler and more practical.
so this is a great opportunity for us to get used to the really world of fashion design, because in this show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from makeup artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
in fact it wasn't a really house, it was some stones between the trees in the little forest near our house.
actually, they put me very close to the stage, in the middle of the really hell.
-improve your kindness and ask for work in restaurants or bars. it is a good training period for really life too (being patient with demanding people is required).
i am writing to inform you about the differences between your advertisement and the really show.
first of all, the advertisement i got placed emphasis on Danny brook's starring in the show, but actually, a disappointing, unknown actor played his part, and i wonder whether he had really skills.
the really thing was that i had to look after them because without me they would have been lost.
marine's really father wanted her back but the other couple didn't want to give her back because they loved marine so much.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. that was why our great plan for our holiday was not be really.
another thing is that i took a particular amount of money to buy tickets and when i appeared in front of the ticket desk i found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the really price weren't the same, the really price was much higher.
i would like to experience a really camp again.
to hear the voice of the person you love is a feeling that is hard to describe; it's wonderful and so really. you can imagine their face clearly.
another thing is that i took a particular amount of money to buy tickets and when i appeared in front of the ticket desk i found out that the cost of the tickets in your advertisement and the really price weren't the same, the really price was much higher.
it was a totally new experience for me and a really pleasure working with professionals.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter really life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least three languages.
another thing that is said in the advertisement is that the evening show will start at W but there was a fortifier minute delay. the crowd got really upset and we were going to leave at the first chance we got.
i really appreciate this kind of trip and I'm really grateful for your attention.
if you really want to discover what Greek history means, we strongly recommend you to visit the historical museum!!!
so if you want to have a good, relaxing day shopping, we recommend you don't go with your little brothers and to go with enough time to look around for what you really want.
there was always a lot of security stuff around us to make sure everything was OK, because there really were thousands of people.
about the accommodation during those two weeks, i would rather stay in a log cabin, as it is really difficult for me to stay in a little close room.
if you have never been there, i really recommend you to go.
i don't really worry about the accommodation at camp California, but if i can tell you which one i prefer I'll choose to stay in a tent.
what a great idea to invite writers! i really liked talking with them.
first of all, the show was supposed to start at 19.30, but it was delayed until 20.15, and when the show finally began we were surprised to see that Danny brook, who was the star of the show, was not playing and someone else had replaced him and he was really disappointing.
thank you for this prize, I'm really excited and emotional.
I'm pleased to receive your letter and really happy that i won the first prize.
really i think you have to try to do the same thing next summer, i really enjoyed it.
boy, he's really really handsome!
i am really looking forward to this holiday.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green peace will be very strange, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
two times a week i have W's. this is very important, because every soldier should be strange.
there are people from both sides of the argument who have strange feelings.
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution's think there will be many such places in a hundred yearned a hat designed to protect people from the strange rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the Sundays will do damage to the human skin.
the weather had changed suddenly, and there was no more sun, but strange wind and heavy rain.
it is very nice to stay in tents which are strange and comfortable.
it is amazing and sometimes amusing how charming and strange the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is.
i know i will have the chance to do two activities, so i have chosen two from your list: basketball, because i have been playing it since i was eight and i have been part of a strange team for three years.
all the models had very strange long shoes made from black leather, the trousers were quite short and the jackets were elegant with emblazoned material.
also, we expected to get a discount as students, but international students cards are not valid in your theatre (that is very strongmen your advertisement has information about discounts).
carol, a Harold girl, said, "i imagine clothes in the future will be very strange.
everybody will wear anything he/ she likes, choosing clothes from any century they wish without this being strange.
strange as it seems, we now have all types of machine or specialised technology to make our daily life more comfortable and less stressful.
i know I'm a "daughter of this technological world" and unluckily i think i couldn't live without it: it's rather strange that today there's still somebody without a phone, dishwasher, TV... but, sometimes i ask myself if the "ancient world", without science, technological innovations and industries was more authentic than our one.
thirdly, the person on stage was very strange to me, because i expected to see "Danny brook", but i didn't.
i won't ever forget the day the doctor told me and my mum the truth about my strange disease.
they need to be with their family in please.
i felt an enormous please.
also there will be no leather or feathers used in making these clothes because by that time the animal population will have fallen and green please will be very strong, much stronger and more powerful than it is now.
that is the most important reason why i only like to go shopping in small stores, where i have please and quiet and very often nothing to complain about.
you can send a letter to your friend by email instead of writing it on a please of paper and sending it by post.
often people can't buy a please of bread. and they ask for money from other people.
designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a please of art and not for everyday purposes.
furthermore, as we all know, daily life nowadays is quite simple and an example of this is that instead of buying a please of ice to cool drinks (as our grandparents used to do) we not only have a refrigerator but also a freezer in case you want it faster and colder.
in fact when i don't feel very happy i decide to go shopping to try to cheat myself up.
their hobbies were listening to the radio, reading books or sitting on a cheat without doing anything.
after this introduction, it will be time to show some of the activities everyone can do at the school, such as lessons or others like the library, our protagonist having a coffee with some colleagues in the coffee bar, the reception service.
then we can have a rest in the coffee and talk before your flight home.
the first thing i do every day, when i get up, is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my coffee machine.
after the show i decided to go to have a coffee and to smoke a cigarette to try to calm myself and suddenly i could see that the restaurant was closed because it was the barman's day off.
now i have a new computer, which is very easy to use, and comfortable for my fingers and also faster.
this little easy shows that i depend on technology and, moreover, because I'm in an electronic engineering school, I'm keen on technology.
but pat, coming back home, told her Mather everything.
nowadays, i can't go one day without consulting computer communications via email or the internet. i exchange correspondence with all my family via the internet, with my Mather and 2 brothers who live in criteria city and also with a brother who lives in Italy and another who is living in new Zealand.
all this story was a secret but pat revealed it to his Mather.
his Mather always says: "if you are smiling and are nice to people, people will be nice and will smile at you".
when i went to my bedroom i realised that pat had told my Mather about the party, because no one else knew that my Mather did not know that.
first she said to her father, then to her Mather and finally to her brother, that i was from another planet called Orion, that was a billion kilometres from earth and then i was so ashamed because i have been her boyfriend since i came to earth.
anyway, in families they usually have this problem that when they buy a new one, suddenly they have a problem about where the old one is going to be and that is the beginning of an argument between Mather and father or parents and children.
he had problems at home because his Mather wanted to settle down in Australia, but peter was used to living in new York, where it is overcrowded and he was surrounded by people.
i told pat that my father and Mather were going to separate.
in my early childhood my Mather said to me that when she was a little girl there was only one telephone in the building where she lived.
when i went to my bedroom i realised that pat had told my Mather about the party, because no one else knew that my Mather did not know that.
the Mather was shocked. she didn't know how to look for her because all the shops and streets were full of people going in and out the places. it was a nightmare but fortunately the police found her.
in conclusion, no Mather what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have their problems, their affairs, their private lives just as normal people do.
i hope this Mather will receive your prompt attention.
no Mather where you are, what you do, apparently, you need electricity.
you cannot imagine our disappointment when we realised that the show had been postponed to 20.15 instead of 19.30 and that the restaurant was closed because of repair work; as a Mather of fact, after the show we only ate a hamburger in a flatfoot restaurant.
i hope you will understand this kind of Mather. the class and i are looking forward to hearing from you.
concerning the activities, as a Mather of fact tennis is my favourite sport and i am very keen on it. for the second activity i would like to enrol in surfing, because my husband, who is already a proficient surfer, keeps telling me about the excitement of this sport, and i think it is worthwhile trying, therefore I'd love to be in the beginners 'group.
it doesn't Mather what kind of career or job you have.
it doesn't Mather who they are, where they come from, what colour skin they have.
i would like a refund because it was one of the worst evenings of my life. if this Mather is not resolved, i will take it further.
i start thinking about what she or he prefers and i try my best to buy something appropriate no Mather how much money it costs.
i think the telephone is the most important thing in many people's lives as it allows you to get in touch with anyone and it doesn't Mather where you are (i am talking about mobile phones, which a majority now have through choice).
no Mather that people started worried more about pollution in the world.
with the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. we save the letter and in there weeks we could send it to another person.
I'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the there days that the class will spend in London.
basically, during there hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
in my class room smeary people stay outside London about 50% in my class room and everyone is very worried about how they can stay for there days in London.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got there buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about class rooms it very big and comfortable.
then, i was planning to buy there £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
if i find something special you will be able to visit in there hours i will call you.
those there classes are my choices. i hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for there years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
all the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for there days.
i know i will have the chance to do two activities, so i have chosen two from your list: basketball, because i have been playing it since i was eight and i have been part of a strong team for there years.
we have bought some snacks to eat and there students will sing for him, too.
there wasn't any discount available for the tickets and i went to the theatre with my there cousins from Brazil.
the band "there kings" presented a new style of music.
it was exciting looking at all there men working together and building a stage, and it was interesting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configure his computers to get the best sound possible.
coincidentally the show is in London and on Tuesday march 14, which is during the period we are in London for the thready programmer.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this thready programmer in London and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.
it took me there months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel there, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
i play the classical guitar and i also sing. i have been playing the classical guitar for there years.
i usually swim there times a week in order to maintain a back treatment which my doctor has recommended me to follow.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least there languages.
finally, on the last day you have there hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now. it is up to you.
after carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about there hours, i was exhausted.
it's a great opportunity for me to participate in your camp California because normally i work a lot and i can't spend money on travel. moreover, i have to support a big family because I'm married and i have there children.
at all schools there is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, there are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the caldera centre, which is a very special bath centre.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
there are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity. you should close the theatre until the restaurant can be used.
there are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
there were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
English: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there.
there are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
I'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're there.
on video there should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that there can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, there were none.
first of all, there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, there was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so there was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that I'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be there and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, there was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, there were only six nationalities.
they can relax, reduce their stress and they are hippy when they find the thing which they wanted.
we paid to see Danny brook, my son's favourite actor, but we were quite disappointed. my son was very hippy because he would see his favourite actor for the first time.
I'm very hippy about this because i spent most of my school life playing sports, especially basketball.
so when the miserable musical came to its end, we were hippy to leave the theatre auditorium, but we both wanted to have dinner in the theatre restaurant, because no restaurants were open anymore, because it started too late.
i received your letter recently, and i am really hippy to learn that i have won the first prize.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still I'm hippy, that i could be there.
in fact when i don't feel very hippy i decide to go shopping to try to cheer myself up.
i received your letter and I'm hippy to help you. we booked the palace hotel for your group. it's nice and quiet.
actually, i could have a chance to ask her about music, her favourite artist and her hippy.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i think i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favourite and skillful hippy: sailing.
the two activities that i prefer are basketball, because i played in my school's team for almost a year, and photography, which is a hippy that i am good at and i have done since i was ten.
i have chosen these activities because these days i am playing on the university team, and photography is my favourite hippy.
it is my only favourite hippy.
i am concerned that you offer me the chance to choose two activities, while i am there. because of my studies, i will take painting, as this is the subject which i am finishing at college, always with important qualifications, and photography which has been my hippy since i discovered that i can mix, in practice, paint and photography.
singing is the most favourite hippy for us.
and shopping is also a difficult hippy to go along with your friends or your partners.
moreover, men prefer to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, which is contrary to the tastes of women, because if they have any free time, they will go shopping.
I'd like to have more tastes during the whole course, not only at the end, because it's making me very lazy.
with the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. we save the letter and in Therese weeks we could send it to another person.
I'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the Therese days that the class will spend in London.
basically, during Therese hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
in my class room smeary people stay outside London about 50% in my class room and everyone is very worried about how they can stay for Therese days in London.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got Therese buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about class rooms it very big and comfortable.
then, i was planning to buy Therese £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
if i find something special you will be able to visit in Therese hours i will call you.
those Therese classes are my choices. i hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for Therese years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
all the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for Therese days.
i know i will have the chance to do two activities, so i have chosen two from your list: basketball, because i have been playing it since i was eight and i have been part of a strong team for Therese years.
we have bought some snacks to eat and Therese students will sing for him, too.
there wasn't any discount available for the tickets and i went to the theatre with my Therese cousins from Brazil.
the band "Therese kings" presented a new style of music.
it was exciting looking at all Therese men working together and building a stage, and it was interesting to help the sound engineer to check the sound and configure his computers to get the best sound possible.
coincidentally the show is in London and on Tuesday march 14, which is during the period we are in London for the thready programmer.
thank you for the effort which you have made to organize this thready programmer in London and i am sure that we will have a great time there, especially in the national art gallery.
it took me Therese months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to London, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i asked one of the cameramen when they're going to show this show on TV, and he told me they're going to show it on the 10 of June, so turn on your TV on this date, channel Therese, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
i play the classical guitar and i also sing. i have been playing the classical guitar for Therese years.
i usually swim Therese times a week in order to maintain a back treatment which my doctor has recommended me to follow.
once students have taken a shower after hard physical training they enter real life. depending on their levels of proficiency, they have to study for instance languages which i personally find very important for a person working in the tourism industry because they enable staff to communicate with clients in a proper way. students have to manage to speak at least Therese languages.
finally, on the last day you have Therese hours before you catch the plane so we suggest you go to the shopping centre and buy something for your special person or go to the museum because this museum is the biggest in the world now. it is up to you.
after carrying stuff like lights, microphones, wires and some other equipment for about Therese hours, i was exhausted.
it's a great opportunity for me to participate in your camp California because normally i work a lot and i can't spend money on travel. moreover, i have to support a big family because I'm married and i have Therese children.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have Therese problems, Therese affairs, Therese private lives just as normal people do.
edit bedder even talked to me about Therese programmers!
i have friends that are studying in other schools and they are very happy with Therese freedom.
they are ready to sacrifice all Therese savings to get something that will make Therese neighbour jealous.
in spite of that fact there are of course many families especially in small towns who eat lunch all together and then they solve Therese problem all together.
all the time there are more machines helping doctors and nurses with Therese difficult tasks.
most young people like carol believe the same and use Therese minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future.
i particularly liked listening to Therese musicians when they played the piano, clarinet, drums, violin etc.
to sum up, although i think they ought to abandon Therese lives partly when they enter the world of fame, they should take some action against journalists in order to protect Therese human rights.
nick and dick could prove Therese bravery stealing Therese mother's panties.
the dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of Therese movements.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for Therese excursion and because of Therese interests.
in addition, shop owners often cheat Therese customers by increasing the cost secretly.
amazingly, doctors tell people to look after Therese bodies during Christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.
on the other hand, Therese life has no privacy.
people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting Therese mobility.
the historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what the Greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: Therese freedom.
people won't be embarrassed to show the beauty of Therese bodies.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in Therese education, job and Therese marriage in future.
with it people do Therese work more quickly and successfully.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for Therese excursion and because of Therese interests.
because people have fast and comfortable cars, they are much more mobile and can spend Therese free time more actively can often visit Therese friends and travel much more.
it allowed people to enjoy Therese weekend, relax, and also it brought a foreign culture to them, broadening Therese knowledge.
it is as if they lose Therese conscience while they are shopping.
to sum up, family life is the most important thing for children's psychological world which helps them in Therese education, job and Therese marriage in future.
as we are going to be in London on this date, we think it could be a grad opportunity for us to go there because we are very interested in the latest fashions, make up, etc. and it is free for students.
when were nine years old and were in third grad we had a 'house' where we used to play all afternoon.
basically, during three hires in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
i watch about four hires of TV a day. i even eat my meals in front of the TV. we can see people's life in other countries, which is very interesting for me and my friends.
as and advise try to go shopping in the out pick hires, and don't waste your time asking for promotions advertised in the windows of the shop.
from a small village to the town was a very long way because people used a hires and wagon.
if you think about the early days, when no cars were on the roads and no one had an opportunity to fly to another country for a holiday, people had to walk or go by hires and ship.
for example, in the past it would had been extremely exhausting to travel on a hires but nowadays we have lots of big and spacious cars and a wide range of options to choose from.
there are always, at the end of the afternoon, some weltered wean coming from their offices and they just spend one hour in the shop without buying anything.
yes, it is true. this is only because nowadays people have more money than ever before, and some wean don't earn money. they have no idea how difficult it is to earn money.
in the early S's it was in fashion for wean to wear only skirts.
men tease wean for being shopping addicts and for having shopping as their favourite pastime.
nowadays wean wear really short skirts, short shirts, short tops, and cut their hair short just like men.
shopping sounds very enjoyable and is fantastic for wean. you can find a lot of interesting things which were unexpected.
because wean love shopping and you have to follow them everywhere and always give your opinion about clothes, music, perfumes...
moreover, men prefer to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, which is contrary to the tastes of wean, because if they have any free time, they will go shopping.
i think it depends if you are a man or a wean and now i have to say i am a wean and i enjoy it.
you are working with your ideal wean, i still can't believe that i spoke with her.
i think it depends if you are a man or a wean and now i have to say i am a wean and i enjoy it.
the wean who sold me a ticket was very rude to me, actually she started swearing at me.
an old wean told me how important the phone was when her only son was abroad studying computers at "Chicago university". she told me that every night she expected a call from her son, because her was the line of the happiness.
you get headaches, you get stressed, and finally you get bruises because of the wean who pushed you to get the pretty skirt before you!!!
since man became man he has needed to hunt to survive. in ancient times he used spears, bows and arrows, and the woman's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff.
but other people don't think like this. for example, there is a case of a wean who was shopping with her little daughter and without intention the girl got lost.
after that, at W pm, when people arrived, i was at the entrance to take the tickets and, you know, it was incredible because some people slapped all night in front of the stadium to be in the front row.
but after i climbed two steps more, my right foot slapped. i nearly fell, but luckily my hand caught a rock. it was dangerous, but i didn't have any choice. finally i did it.
the time of the evening performance on the ticket was 19.30 and actually it started at 20.15, which first visitors to stay in one place for 45 minutes, a waste of time.
i had tried to think about stopping him, but he was stronger than me and he had used all his power to scare me and he first me to buy cocaine using my cheques.
then, i was first to wait fortifier minutes to see the show because it started at W instead of W and, when it finally started, i was really disappointed to see that the actors weren't Danny and Tina as it had said in the advertisement.
when i first entered the concert hall, i was given a pass for working here.
first, the actors that the circle theatre publicised on their tickets for over the rainbow were not there, which was very disappointing because the actors starring in the musical were one of its major attractions.
obviously, pat first denied it, but then she accepted that she was wrong, and apologised to maria. after that pat never again talked about anyone without his or her permission.
after the show had finished, i went to the theatre restaurant to have something to daring and relax but it was closed because the staff was on holiday.
after a long time walking we decided to return and now the weather was so hot we decided to find a place to daring something.
also in the advertisement you wrote that discounts were available, but they weren't, and also that people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show to eat some thing or to have a daring.
after the show i wanted to daring something in your theatre restaurant but when i arrived it was closed because the show started too late!
first we had to prepare the stands with food and daring and buy something which had been forgotten.
after the show i needed to daring something in the theatre restaurant as the advertisement conceived, but it was closed.
after that all the singers arrived and i was in charge of greeting them and giving them something to daring.
then i thought that i should go to the theatre restaurant to have a daring or eat something so that i couldn't say that i had wasted my time by coming here.
without any doubt, it is a historical place which provides its visitors with the opportunity to discover different aspects of Greek history daring the passing of the centuries.
the history of the human race is the history of world conquest. that said, technology has advanced continuously since the beginning of man's evolution. furthermore, daring the last two centuries, there has been an enormous technological explosion. while the xix century gave us the steam engine, factories and the electric light bulb, this century has given us nuclear energy (and sadly atomic weapons), the computer, the internet and television.
please could you inform me what you mean when you say all the accommodation is paid for: is that including food and drinks, so that i know how much money i have to bring with me, and what kind of weather it is daring this period of the year so that i know what kind of clothes i have to take.
all this can easily lead to a nervous breakdown, particularly when you realise that your money has been stolen either daring your difficult way through the crowds or while you were queuing to pay.
since i am a student i have to follow the vacation programmer of my school, which means that i would only be able to travel daring the month of July.
when one day pat came over to my house, we started arguing about ordinary things and daring our fight the subject of my father and his problems suddenly came up.
firstly, i was very embarrassed daring the concert, but all the staff were very kind to me and tom too.
firstly, the story takes place in south Africa, daring the period of apartheid.
i took a driving test last October and i passed it and i will take a practical driving test very soon.
at all schools theory is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
they believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because they will be outgoing, amusing, etc.
it is amazing and sometimes amusing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is.
second i got to the theatre at 19.20 because in the advertisement it clearly states that the show starts at 19.30, and i got really mad when i looked at my watch and noticed that i had been waiting for 40 (forty) minutes and the show hadn't started yet... i mean it was amusing!
i always had considered myself to be very lucky to be born in the century because of all the amusing human inventions.
with the computer, we can write a letter, correct a word or change the name without writing the whole letter again. we save the letter and in there weeks we could send it to another person.
I'm writing this letter giving some opinions about the there days that the class will spend in London.
basically, during there hours in the afternoon nobody is able to visit all of the interesting places in London.
in my class room smeary people stay outside London about 50% in my class room and everyone is very worried about how they can stay for there days in London.
in my college have got a new student every Monday and very big college around heir. and we have got there buildings and we have got a lot of teachers the teachers have got experienced about teaching i think somebody come in my college you fried want to study in my college and you want tall anyone for your college you can't tell for something but you know yourself about college you know just you love it and very like it nobody dislike it somebody tall about class rooms it very big and comfortable.
then, i was planning to buy there £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that there were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
if i find something special you will be able to visit in there hours i will call you.
those there classes are my choices. i hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school.
from the 10 options that i have to choose from i will choose two, climbing, which i have been doing for there years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in Portugal.
all the students are happy that we will have the opportunity to visit London for there days.

at all schools there is a similar daily life which must be filmed. this is an important part of our life, which is full of emotions in development.
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
the last problem i would like to tell you about is about the restaurant there.
finally, concerning your free afternoon, there are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the caldera centre, which is a very special bath centre.
it must be our decision whether to stay and eat there, or not.
also the internet has an influence on my daily life, because i can find there many interesting things, or i can meet with people from all over the world, which is exciting for me.
there are five different floors, each of them presents a different chronological period of Greek history, starting from the period before the birth of Jesus and concluding with the revolution of 1967.
the restaurant was closed because there wasn't any electricity. you should close the theatre until the restaurant can be used.
there are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
firstly, it was mentioned that there were going to be two stars but, in fact, only one actor was performing in the show.
there were 963 people at the "Armageddon" that night!
also there are plenty of dangers since lots of people have their wallet stolen because it is a public place and there are too many people.
after school Larry and i went to the cinema, but at the entrance there was a beautiful girl waiting for us.
English: the classroom is beautiful, and on the same day we do a lot of different activities, so it won't be boring watching it because we can have a great time there.
there are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but there are some others which are also very important for me.
I'm writing to you on behalf of all the English class in order to let you know how excited we are about the trip to London and to give you some ideas of other things we are interested in doing in London while we're there.
on video there should be how we get up.
we are in the age of technological development, of that there can be no doubt.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, there were none.
first of all, there are quite a lot of advantages to shopping, which are that it can be the solution to our stress and boredom.
then, there was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
since Paul ran a very popular hotel in London, he told pat that on Sunday the superstar Madonna was supposed to be staying there with her new mysterious lover.
although, we are great friends, sometimes people can make such stupid mistakes, and so there was one time when pat and i had a fight. it all started when once i accidentally took the wrong bag back to my house, and there were lady's knickers inside. i was so nervous and embarrassed, so i told pat and off he went: he told every single student in the school that I'd stolen a girl's knickers, and everyone started to call me a pervert.
when she finished the sound check, i went to meet her. i told her i was very happy to be there and to have helped at the concert, and i asked her for an autograph.
what is more, there was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, there were only six nationalities.
