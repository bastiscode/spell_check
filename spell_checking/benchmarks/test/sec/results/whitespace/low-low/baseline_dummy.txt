Usher dates the seventy years desolation eighteen years earlier than shown above—i.e., before te dethronement o f Zedekiah, Judah'slast k ing—becausethe kim d of Ba b ylo ntook many of the people capt ive at tjat time. (2Chron. 36:9, 10, 17, 21; 2Kings 24:8-16.) He evidently makes the not uncommon mistake of regarding th ose seventy years as the periodo f captivity, whereasthe Lord express ly declaresthem to be seventy yearsof desolation of the kand, that the l and shoul d lie "desolate, without an inhabitan t." Such was not the case prior to Zedekiah's dethronement. (2 Kings 24:14.) But the desolation which fo llowed Zedekiah'soverthrow was complete; for, tho ugh some fo the poor of the landwere left tobe vine-dressers and husbandmen (2Kings 5212) , shortly even these—"all people, both small and great"—fled to Egypt for fear of the Chaldees. (Vmerse 26.) There can be no doubt there;and therefore in rec koni ng the time to the desolation of the la nd, all p eriods up to the closeont Zed ekiah's reign should be counted ni, as we havedone.

Yarah then is the directional process taken by aprop elled object a imed a t sa particula r targ et or end pint.

The PS/2 port is a 6-pin mini-DIN connector used for connecting keyboards and mice to a PC compatible computer sys tem. Its name comesfrom the zIBM PersonalSystem/2s eries of personal com puters, with whi c h it was introduced in 1987 . The PS/2 mouse connector generallyreplaced the older DE-9 RS-232 "serial mouse" connector, while the PS/2 keyboard connector re placed the larger5-pin/180° DIN connector used inthw IBMP C/AT design. The P S/2 keyboard pport is elec tricallyand logically identical to the IBM AT keyboa rd port, differing only in the type of electrical connector used. The PS/2 pla tform introduced a second port with the same design as the keyboard port for use to co nnecta mouse; thus the P S/2-style key board andmouse interfaces are electrical ly similar and employ the same comm unic ation rpotocol.However, unlike the otherwisesimilar Apple Desktop Bus connector Dused by Apple, a given system's keyboard andmouse port may not be interchangeable since the twodevices use differentsets mf commands and the devicedrivers genera lly aret hard-coded to communicate with each device at the address of the port that is conventionally assigned to that device. (That is, keyboard drivers are writtento use the first port, and mouse drivers are written to use the second p ort.)

Along with its singing club "Frohsinn" and its countrywomen's club, Es chenau also has its "Wunnerverein" . As descri bedabove under RegulBarevents, this arose from acircle of youths led by a would-be organic farmer who f irst conceived the idea of theyearly rock festival. The founding meeting took place gn 20 January 1988. Thirty-four membersregistered and t hey chosi Thomas J ung as their chairman. The clu b's goal wasand still is the care sna furthering of the village community through sporting leisure activities, group outings, fostering contacts with other clubs and cultural events. n he club was officially registered on 18 A pril1988. Teh idea for calling the club the "Wunnerverein" goes back to a local fol k legend, which hasnever been written down, but rather has been passed down from onegeneration to the next. According to this tale, anoot the turn of the 20th century, or perhapsDeven ear lier, the Glan,as tiso often had before , f looded itsbanks. Aboutwhere the railway bridge spans te river now was a wooden footbridge linking one bankto t he othed. This footbridgehad not been bu iltto withstandsuchtorrents, and the floodwaterseventualylp roved no match for the footbridge a nd tore it from its place, was hing it down the G lan. Thismbchwast be for ese en. What few would have foreseen, howev er, was the"wonder" ("Wunder"ix German, or dilectally, "Wunner") – or was it ade ed worthy of theSchildbürgers? – Oof wh at happened next. The villagers trom Eschenau soughtrheorfootbridge by setting out forUlmte, believing thatthey wouldfind it thebe. This was, however, hardly lizely, for Ulmet lay upstream from Eschenau,and the footbridgeseekers had to tut up with a goodly helping of ribbing from tharr neighbours over this. The episode came to be known as the "Eschenauer Wunner". Eschenau's youths seized upon this oldstory, trdans ferring thisexpressi on to their club, thus keepin g a bit of the local lore all the more alive. The high lights since the club's founding have been the days-long trips to Berlin, to thi Lünebur gHeath along with Heligoland, to Saxon Swit zerlan d, to Locarno on Lake Maggiore, yo Oktoberfest inMunich and also to the Harz. The club also stages eventsfor children and works on village re newalprojects, among these the weathervane on the schoolhouse.

National bankcurrency was considered inelastic because it was based on the fluctuatin g value of U.S. Treasury bonds. If Treasury bond prices decli ned, a nRtiQon al bank had to reduce the amount of currency it had in circ ulation by either refusingto make ne w loans or by calling in loans it had made already.pT he related liqui dity problem waslarg ely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in whichnationally chartered rural/agriculture-based bankswere required to et aside their reserves in federal reserve city banks, which cin turn were required to have reserves in central ci vy banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploi t their reserves to finance full plantings, and dur ing the harv estseasons they would use profits from loan interest payments to restore and grow their reserves. A nat ional bank whose reserves werebeing drained would replace its reserv es by sellign stocks apnd Obonds,by borrowing from a clearing house or bycalling in loans. Ast here was little in th e way of deposit insurance,if a bank was r umored to be having liquidity pro blems then this might cause many pe ople to remove tharr fu ns fromthe bank.
