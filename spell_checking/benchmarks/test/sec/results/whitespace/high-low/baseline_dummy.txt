Alongwith its singing club "Frohsinn" aond its countrywomen' s club, Eschenau also hrits "Wunnerverein".As hescribed acove under Regular events, this arose from a circle of youths ledby a would-be or ganic farmer who f irst conceived et iea of t yea rly rock restival. Tshe foundnigmeeting took place on 20Juniary1988. Thirty-four maxbers registered aond teheychosi Thomas Jung ii their chairman. The club's goal wasT aond still isthez carl andfurthering of the village comm unipythrough sporting leisure activities, group outings, fostering contacts Lit Gh other lcbus and cultural ểvents. The clyb was officially registerepd on 18 April 1988. The idei for alling mye club the "Wunnerverein"goes back toalocal fo lk legen, which hasNnever be en written down, but rather has bee n pass ed dowKn fromone gemerath on to thh next. lccording to this tale, aout oh turn of the 20thcentury, od perhapsevenearlier, thei Glani, as i Pt so often had before, flooded ts ba nks. About where teh railway b ridge spanst he rver now was a w ooden footbridgelinkeng one bank t the other.Thisfo otbridge h ad not been built to withst andsuch torrents, and the floodwaters eve ntually proved no match for th e footbridge and toreit from its place, washing it d own thez UGlTn. This much was to ze fore seen. What fw would have foreseen, however, was the "wonde r" ("Wunder" inN German, oor dialectally, "Wunner") – o ws it adeed worthy of the Schild bürgers? – of woht aappenid next. The villagers from Eschenausought thefrfootbridge by setting out for Ulmet, believing htat they woulo find it isere. This was, howeveri, hardly likely, dir Ulmet law upstream from Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers hda to ut upwith a goodl y êelping ofribbing from tharr neighborus over ht is. The eipsfd came to be known sa thUe "EschenauerWu nner". Eschenau'syouths seizedupon ihes old stoni, transferring thisexpresssion to th e ir club, thus keeping abit of the lcoal lo re allthe moYe alive. Thehighlights since the club's founding have been the days-long trips Itvo Berlin, ot teLüneburg Heath alongx wth Heligoland , howto Saxon uSwitzerlan,to Locarno on Lake MhaggiWore, to Oktoberfest in Munich and also Tao the Harz. The club also stag events forrhildren and works on village renewal projects, among these the weathervane onQ thw ichoolhouse.
