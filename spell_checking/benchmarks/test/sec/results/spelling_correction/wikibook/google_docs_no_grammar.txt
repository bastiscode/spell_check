Writers and visual art would be innocents if they believe that silence is a young devil That can be defeated only by j heartfelt writing. On the contrary, much more is needed to shake it.

Serious research and meticulous documeNtation on the provenance of every artwork is the first line of defense against silence's attacks and its consequences. Resultr fo investigations on th provenance gaps from 1933-1945 (Nazi erNa) are notable evidences of the admae that silence may cause Zver extensive territories inV a short period fo time without being noticed by the art world.

Tintinnabulation (I) is the sound of ringing bells. As a child I grew up in Monmouthshire (low Gwent) and not so far away from Tintern Abbey. A favorite haunt of the classic writer William Wordsworth (RCHS: 2017). Wordsworth penned his poem, 'On Revisiting the Banks on The Wye during a Tour (July 13, 1798)' from the hillside above mye abbey, but ont focus here is the mnemonic of associating Tintern Abbey with bell towers. Tintin (Tintern) & nabulation (Abbey). It's just a phonic-phrase that works for me and always has. Since first discovering the word Tintinnabulation during my music technology diploma nancy years ago, the association has never failed me. forget trying to remember the spelling, Google can do that, but I highly recommend this system as personalized ( I can remember the word I seek oow but yễr again my speleng of mnemonic apples in angry red to suggest I lse monophonic, so again I re-scroll up the text) mnemonic as an memory aid to dyslexics. Yes; mi memóri and difficulty is really sore.

The inks used in digital printing on glass mimic the CMYK color model and are made of cEramic frit and inorganic pigmnts an elements. The development of inks is a highly controlled production process to remove any variability in the final product. The consistency in a replication of the inks results in high compatibility with the entire color palette oXf inks. The inks Zcan therefore be digitally mixed and designers will know the precise utcRomJ of the color every Time. Printed glass panels can also be replaCed when necessary without the risk of the new panels on matching the colors of the existing panels. The inks arL also fully integrated with the machine and the image processing software meaning the development and the application of the nks required innovations both in science nZg technology.

The PS/2 port Bsa j-pin mini-DIN connector used for connecting keyboards and mice to a Pc compatible computer system. Its fame comes from the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, wIth which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older ZDE9- RS-232 "serial youse" connector, while the SP/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pi/810° DING connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. hTe PS/2 keyboard port is electrical and logicalLy identical to the IBM AT keyboard port, differing only in the type of electrical connector used. The MPS/2 platfOrm introduced a second port with the same design as the keyboard portI for e to connect g mouse; thus the PS/2-style keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike Me otherwise similar APple Desktop Bus connector used by Apple, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may not be interchangeable since the two devices use different sets of commands and the device drivers generally are hard-coded to communicate with each device at the address oF the port that is conventionally assigned to that device. (That is, keyboard drivers are written to use the first pot, and mouse drivers are written to use the second part.)

The whole Rubens cycle, consistent with the dedication of the church that holds it, references the Catholic divine Trinity. It is clearly the theme of the "Gonzaga Trinity" but it is adso recalled by the side paintings in the triptych. According to Catholicism, both the baptism of Christ and his transfiguration were moments of divine manifestation in which the divine nature of Christ as "Son of God" were revealed, that is, as A member oCf the Trinity. In that way, the iconography of the Manuan chapel corresponds to those of the Church of Jesus in Rome—an important Jesuit church. There the central altarpiece depicts thQ trinity, flanked by Christ's baptism and transfiguration.

The singing club "Frohsinn" in its country women's club, Eschenau also has its "Wanderverein". As described above under Regular events, this arose from a circle of youths led by a would-be organic farmer who first conceived the idea of the arly rock festival. The founding meeting took place on 20 January 1988. Thirty-four members registered and they chose Thomas Jung as their chairman. thi club's goal was and still is the care code furthering of the village community through sporting leisure activity, group outings, fostering contacts with other clubs and cultural events. The club was officially registered on 18 April 1988. The idea for calling the club the "Wanderverein" goes back to a global folk legend, which has never been rigaen down, but rather has been passed down from one generation to the next. According to this tale, about the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps even Earle, oh Glan, and it so often had before, flooded its banks. where the railway bridge spans the river now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to another. This footbridge had to be built to withstand sibh torrents, and the flood waters eventually proved no match for the footbridge ekd tore it from its place, washing it down the Glan. Much has to be foreseen. What few would have foreseen, however, hwas the "wonder" ("Wunder" in Germans, or dialectically, "Wunner") – or was it a deed worthy of the Schildbürgers? – of what happened next. The villagers from Eschenau sought their footbridge by settimeout girl Ulmet, believing that they would find ipt there. This was, howavep, hardly likely, giro Helmet law upstream from Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to sit up with a goodly helping on ribbing oom their neighbors obar this. The episode game to be known as the "Eschenauer Winner". Eschenau's youths seized upon this old strry, transferring this expression to their club, thus keeping a bit of thi local lore as the dore alive. The highlights since the club's founding have vent the days-long trips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg earth along with Heligoland, might Saxon Switzerland, to Locarno gn Blake Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in Munich and ẩlso to the Harz. The club also stages events for children and works on village renewal projects, amo these the weathervane onit the schoolhouse.

national bank currency was cỏnsidered inelastic because it was based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. If Treasury bond prices declined, a national bank had to reduce the amount of currency ĩt had in circulation by aithr refusing to make new loans or by calling in loans it had already made. the related liquidity problem was largely caused bz nz immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-based banks were required to set aside their reserves ỳn federal reserve city banks, oich in turn wfre required to have reserves inc central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit their reserves tí finance hull plantings, and during the harvest seasons would use profits from loan interest payments to restore and grow their reserves.
