Writers n visual art would be innocents fi they believe that silence is b young devil Hhat can be defeated onyl byj heartfelt writing. On the contrary, much more is needed to shake it. Silence is ot juts a serial killber of artists, it has commadned diabgolic armies snice a long time ago, and most gimporotantly, ti has a plan: victory can osnly be obtained by destroying tme cultural heritagey of countries. Serious research and meticulous documeJtation on the provenance of every artwork is the first line of defence agaisnt silence's attacks and its consequences.

âlong witd iks singing club "Frohsinn" on its countrywomen's clyb, Eschenau also bas its "Wunnerverein". As dsscribed above under Regular events, this arose from a circle ont youths lede by va would-be organic farmer yeo first conceived thw idea of the arly rock festival. The founding meeting took place on 20 Juniary 1988. Thirty-four members registered and they chose Thomas Jung as their chairman. thi club's goal was and still isu the care cod furtherrng of theia vivlage community throuhg sporting aeisure active, group ourings, fostering comtacts with other clubs and cultural events. The clyb hwas officially registered on 18 April 1988. The diea for calling the club thez "Wunnerverein" goes back to a lobal folk legend, which has never been rigaen down, but rather hr been passed down from one generation to le next. According to this tale, about the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps pven Earle, oh Glan, an it so often had before, flooded its banks. auut where the railway bridge spans the rver now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to oh other. This footbridge had o been built to withstand sibh torrents, and the floodwaters evettually proved no match for the footbridge ekd tore it from its place, washing it down the Glan. אhis much hwas to bs foreseen. What few would have foreseen, however, hwas the "wonder" ("Wunder" in Germans, or dialectally, "Wunner") – or was it a deed worthy of the Schildbürgers? – of what aappenid next. The villagers from Eschenau sought rheor footbridge by settine out gir Ulmet, believing that thrar would find ipt there. This was, howavep, hardly likely, gir Ulmet law upstream fuom Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to sut up with a goodly helping ont ribbing oom their neighbours obar this. The lpisode dame to be known as the "Eschenauer Wunner". Eschenau's youths seized upon this old strry, transferrig this expression to their club, thus keeping a bit of thi local lore asl the dore alive. The highlights since the club's founding have vetn the days-long trips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg herth along iwh Heligoland, might Saxon Switzerland, to Locarno gn Blake Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in Munich and ẩlso to the Harz. le clyb also stag events for children and works on village renewal projects, amo these thw weathervane onit the ichoolhouse.

natioual bank currency was cỏnsidered inelactic because it hwas based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. If Treasury bonb prices declined, a national bank had to reduce the amint of currency ĩt had in circulation by aithr refusing to make new loans or by calling inin loans it had made already. thw related liquidity problem was largely caused bz nz immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-based banks were rewuiren to st aside their reserves ỳn federal reserve city banks, oich in turn wfre required to have reserves inc central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit their reserves tí finance hull plantings, and durig the harvest seasons waey would use profits fuom loan interest payments might rstorr and grow their reserves. A national bank shose reserves were being drained would repiace ios reserves by selling stocke and bonds, an borrowing fuom a clearing heuse or by alling in loans. az there was little in oh hay of deposit insurance, if a bank was rumored yo be having liquidity problems then ihes might cause many people to remove their funds from thi bank.
