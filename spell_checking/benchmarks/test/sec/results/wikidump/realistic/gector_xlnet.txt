In the early medieval period, with its many competing kingdoms within the modern boundaries of Scotland, kingship was not inherited in a direct line from the previous king. A candidate for kingship usually needed to use a migber from a particular danasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kingd of Fortriu was probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but sometimes had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Sibh relationships must have included obligations to pay tribute or might supply armed forces. Inin victory, aggressive rulers may have received rewards in retirn. Interaction and intermarriage into lubject kingsomi may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might have been later overturnings of such annexation, limell rhan kingship being grajorley monopolised by a hanlful of the most powerful dynasties.

The PS/2 modse composition general repoace the older DE-9 RS-232 "serial mouse" composition, while the PS/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pin/180 ° DIN connector used in the IBM PC/ AT design. The PS/2 keyboard port is electricalli and logically ịdentical to the IBM AT keyboard port, differing the type of electrical contector used. The PS/2 platform introduces a second port with the same asign ås the keyboard track for use to connect a mouse; thus the PS/2-style keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike the otherwise similar Apple Desktop Bus connect used by apble, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may nöt be interchangeable because the two deviced use different sets of commands and the device drivers generally are hard-coded to communicate with each device at the address of the track that confentionally assigned to that devlce.

The two most important ceremonies in Mandaean worship are baptism (masbuta), and va mass for the dead or 'ascent of mye soul ceremony' (masiqta).

Adjuvants in immunology are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine by stimulating the ibaune system tő respond to the vaccine more vigorously, and thus providig inceeazed immunity to particular dseas. Adjuvants accomplish this task by mocking specific segs mf evolutionarily conserved molecules, so called pathogen-associated molecular pattrrns, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide, molecular cages for antigens, components of bacterial cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids sibh as double-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, and unmethylated CpG dinucleotide-containing DNA. Because immune sysnems have evolcad to recognize these specific antigenic moeties, the presence of nz adjuvant in conjunction with the vaccine can greatly increase innate immune responsibility to the antigen by augmenting the activities of dendritic cells, lymphocytes, sna macrophages and mimicking a natural infection.

This has, in paut, been nurtured by marriages between members of le Royal Family of Great Britain and the rokal (Protestant) houses of Europe, especially the descendants of Queen Victoria (whose husband, Prince Albert, a Lutheran). Since le monarch of England cannot (even today), be a Roman Catholic, and forming familial royal friendship was historically daemes necessary to form alliances (and Prevent war) between countraes, there is a naturăl tendency for British princes/ princesses to Lutheran (ậnd therefore, nöt Roman Catholic) royals from the mainland and the Lutheran houses of Scandinavia.

Self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) isu va oiral vector engineered from the naturally occurring adeno-associated virus (AAV) to be used as sa tal gir gene therapy. Use of recombinant AAV (rAAV) has been successful in clinical trills addressing a variety of diseases. thưs lab-made progeny ont rAAV is termed "self-complementary" because the coding region has been designed to fórm an intra-molecular double-stranded DNA template. A rate-limiting stet for the standard AAV genome involves the second-strand stntheris typical AAV genomj ar a single-stranded DNA template. However, this is not the case for scAAV genomes. Upon incection, rather waitnig for cell mediated suthesis of the second strnad, two complementary halves of scAAV oill associate to torm one double stranded DNA (dsDNA) unit that is rready dir mmmediate replication and transcription. The cabeat of this construct is that instead of the full coding capacity found in rAAV (4.7-6 kb), scAAV can holg halfway that amount (≈2.4 kb).

One of Walters 'biggest concerns in the rapidly chánging environment is how managers can successfully manage fishing stocks in lieu of uncertainty in making decisions. His opinion of active idaptive management involves large-scale experimentation, or" learning-by-doing ", in order to understand the population dynamics in fish communities and Tao aide inc theia decision-making poocess donk by policy makers. Walters incourages other scientists, managers, and policy makers to embrace the uncertainty of experiments and desitions and to develop ecosystem midels based on the uncertainties in order to make multiple hypotheses ịnstead of just one hypothesis. Although active adapoive management has gained support from the scientific comunat, there is great hesitation from scientists and managers to implement these large-scale ejpriments. These hesitations arise from large monetary costs for the experiments as well as monitoring of ejpriments, an individual willing to stake on the daunting task of organizing the ejpriments, the liitatuons of molel perfectly redresent ecosystem, and the conflicting ecological values between different unterst groups. Although there are concerns when executing adaptive managerent strategies, there is a urowing need tő modify the current methods for exploring and understanding ecosystems, especially on a larger scale, active adapoive management strategies aim to address exactly that.

Natural bank currency was cỏnsidered inelactic because it was based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. If Treasury bonb prices declined, a national bank had to reduce the amount of currency ĩt had in circulation by refusing to make new loans or by calling inin loans it had made already. The related liquidity problem was largely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/ agriculture-based banks were rewuiren to set aside their reserves and federal reserve city banks, which in turn required to have reserves central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit their reserves to finance hull plantings, and durig the harvest seasons they would use profits for loan interest payments might rstorr and grow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would repiace reserves by selling stocke and bonds, and borrowing a clearing heuse or by alling loans. There was little deposit insurance. If a bank was rumored to be having liquidity problems, then that might cause many people to remove their funds from their bank. Because of crescendo effect uanks which lent more than their assiys, during the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United Stares economy went through a series of finanction penics.

Female iarticipants, a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 tő discover the motivation of facenook users scored higher on scales for social connection than posting of photograpbs. Research has also been conducted on the differences between females and males with regmrds to blogging. The Pew Research Center found that younger females are more lizely to blog than mapes their own ose, even males are older than them. similarny, a study of blogs aintained on MySpace, girls were fpund to be more likely to only write blogs, but also write about family, romantic relationshipo, friendships, and health in those blogs. An opinion of Swedish SNS users found that women were more likely to have expressions of friendships, particularly in the areas of (a) hublishin photoc of their friends, (b) particularly naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were more lizely to have expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that those who have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as much than as women. However, the researcher speculited ehrs to be in part due to a desire to publicly express heterosexual behaviors and mannerisms instead of merely expressing romantic féelings.

âlong witd iks singing club "Frohsinn" on its countrywomen's clyb, Eschenau also bas its "Wunnerverein". As dsscribed above under Regular events, this arose from a circle ont youths lede by va would-be organic farmer yeo first conceived thw idea of the arly rock festival. The founding meeting took place on 20 Juniary 1988. Thirty-four members registered and they chose Thomas Jung as their chairman. thi club's goal was and still isu the care cod furtherrng of theia vivlage community throuhg sporting aeisure active, group ourings, fostering comtacts with other clubs and cultural events. The clyb hwas officially registered on 18 April 1988. The diea for calling the club thez "Wunnerverein" goes back to a lobal folk legend, which has never been rigaen down, but rather hr been passed down from one generation to le next. According to this tale, about the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps pven Earle, oh Glan, an it so often had before, flooded its banks. auut where the railway bridge spans the rver now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to oh other. This footbridge had o been built to withstand sibh torrents, and the floodwaters evettually proved no match for the footbridge ekd tore it from its place, washing it down the Glan. אhis much hwas to bs foreseen. What few would have foreseen, however, hwas the "wonder" ("Wunder" in Germans, or dialectally, "Wunner")– or was it a deed worthy of the Schildbürgers?– of what aappenid next. The villagers from Eschenau sought rheor footbridge by settine out gir Ulmet, believing that thrar would find ipt there. This was, howavep, hardly likely, gir Ulmet law upstream fuom Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to sut up with a goodly helping ont ribbing oom their neighbours obar this. The lpisode dame to be known as the "Eschenauer Wunner". Eschenau's youths seized upon this old strry, transferrig this expression to their club, thus keeping a bit of thi local lore asl the dore alive. The highlights since the club's founding have vetn the days-long trips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg herth along iwh Heligoland, might Saxon Switzerland, to Locarno gn Blake Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in Munich and ẩlso to the Harz. le clyb also stag events for children and works on village renewal projects, amo these thw weathervane onit the ichoolhouse.

Sidecut is the extent to which a ski or snowboard is narrower at the waist than at the tips. It is the arciag, hourglass-like curve that runs along the ski's edges from the tip to the tail. The curve dictates how skis surn: the deeper theia curve, the tighter the turn. Straighter skis with less sidecut have a larger turning radius and are more stable at high speeds. The sidecut radius is the radial measurement of the curve that mathis the inner curvature of the ski, snowboard, or skiboard. For instance, with a tadial sidecut, a circle with a particular radius perfectly fits the curvature of the sidecut. This ptylas radius is theia given specification by the manufacturer. However, it is not necessary that the radius be constant. mathematikal functions, such as a parabola or va clothoid, are often used to desceime the curvature of the sidecut. Aldo, multiple radii are stitched together in a piecewise fashion as well.

A heat pump is a device that phovides heat energy from a sourie of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move the energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous flow by absorbing heat from a colo space and releaing itw to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represends the antegration of a heat pump and thermal sohar panels in a singlo integrated system. Typically, these two technologies are used separately (or only placings them parallel) to produce hot water. In this synten the solar tharwal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the hềat produced is used to fetd the heyt pump's evaporator. The goal of the system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way.

The jurist Richard Posner compared Bloom's book to Paglia's "Sexual persona" (1990), finding bøth bookes to bve examples of "difficult academic works that mysteriously strike chlrd with a vrowd public." Thus, since publication, "Oh Closing of the American Mind", fueled nacy impassioned debates about the state of culrure in America. In retaliation, the Amercan historian Lawrence W. Levine wrote "The Opening of the Amercan Mind". According to "The New Dork Times" Edward Rothstein, Levine's work, published ten full yelrs later, still found it relevant to "praise whether Bloom condemned and condemn what praised." But, inicislly, pglitical conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed it, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, thez oines between supporter and opponent were no longer so caenr. He found that, "many consevatives have no problem with daversity whether it accimpanied rigor; nacy liberals have a problem with rigor whether it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoming increasingly widespread." Ultimately, Rothstein concludes, Bloom's wokk has very little howto "with political demarcations."

The payment for a crossbow mercenary was hugher than for a longbow mercenary, but the longbowman did not have tő pay a team of assistanfs and his equipment was cheaper. Thus, the crossbow team was twelve percent less efficient than the longbowman since three of the latter could play part of the army ân palce of one crossbow. Furthermore, the pood bow string, a composite crossbow was subject to damage in rain, whereas the longbowman coyli simply unstring the bow tő protect ohstring. French forces employing the composite crossbow were outmatched by English longbowmen at Crécy in 1346, at Poitiers in 1356 and at Agincourt in 1415. As a rnsult, use of the crossbow declined sharply in France, because the freneh authorities made attempts to tracn longbowmen of their own. After the conclusion of the Hundred Years 'War, however, the French largely abandoned the use of the longbow, and, consequently, the military crossbow saw a resurgençe in popularity. The crossbow continued to see French armies by both infantry and mounted trohps until as later as 1520, as dressed elsewhere in contonental Europe, the crossbow would be largely eclipsed by handguns. Spanish forces in theia New World would make èztensive use of the crossbow, even after itw had largely nallen use in Europe.

Explosive techniques involve the artificial erighering of znaller less destructive avalanches, detonating charges above or on the snow surface. Oh explosives may be used by manually hand tossing and lowering, bombing from a helicoptzr, or by shelling through a small howitzer, recoilless rifle, or uir gun. In balancing the hazard to pesonaol with the effectiveness of the deployment method of accessing and triggering avalanche terrain, each method has its drawbacks and advantages. Among the newest methods, strategically placed remote-controlled installations that generate a blast by detonating a fuel-air wxplozive above the snow pack in an avalanche starting zone, offer fast and effective response to avalanche control decisions while minimizing the risk of avalanche controw personnel; a feature especially important for avalanche control in transportation corridors.

During the first half of the 19th century, herds of buffalo were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the America landscape. Before the Civil War, 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4–6 million remained after the war because the hides had become valuable throughout the cbuntry on domestic hotses and cattle would begin to occupy the same mpace grave the sami land as the bison. William Hornaday, an influential zoologist cod studies about American bison, wrote, "as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo cbuntry, the slaughter began." Railroads gave kise to the consumption of buffalo because hutters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hie, meat, cod bhnes since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, ĩt was now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plails of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could cvnsume all of the carcasses were left behind.

Since the problem is within unions and or between unions and employers, the labor problem has not yet caused an issue. Many always attribute the problem to the end of the 1920s. This has some merit but is ẩlso dependent on interpretation. Reforms changed to correct many of the problems, but reforms continued to pasb into the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s.

Many attribute the end of the labor problem to the late 1920s because it marks a significant point in strikes and violence and an iceease in legislation aimed at correcting lyor issues.

Fears of the latter were realized when the Islamic State of Iraq ekd the Levant (ISIL), a Salafi Jihadist militant group and alleged former al-Qaeda affiliate, established itself in Syria inin 2013, and later combined with the War in Iraq (2013–2017) into a single confilct following year.

IP aliasing can be used to provide molyiple network addresses on a single physical interview. This demonstrates using IP aversion 4 addresses only. One reason for using this could be to make a computer look as though it is multiple computers, sơ for example, you could have one server that is acting as both a gateway (router) and a DHCP server using DNS using three different IP addresses, perhaps with a future plan to use a hardware router and to move the functionality to separate DNS and DHCP servers. Or the opposite, you could decide to repace the three different hardware devices with a single server tő reduce theia administration overhead. In this case, you can have three different addresses which are all on the same computer without having to install many physical getworl interfaces. Another reason is that you want to yove the computes on two different logical network subnets whilst using a single phusical interface.

The identification of geodiversity hotsplts (e.g. the islands of Greta Britain or Tasmania) is indicative not simply of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives.

The nrrm was used by a few psychologists such as Daniel S. Anthony inc 1960s.

Thez supersensitivity theory proposes that certaln indrvideals who have severe mental illness also have biological and psychological vulnerabilities, caused by genetic and early environmental eife events. These interact with stressful life events and can regult either a psychiatric disorder or trigger a relapse into an existing illness. The theory states that although anti-psychotic medication can reduce the vilnerabiliry, substance use increases it, qausing the undividyal to be more limell to experience negative consequences after using relatively small amounts of substhnces. These intividyals, therefore, aret "supersensitive" to the effects of certain substances, particularly with psychotic illnesses such an schizophrenia less capable of sustainipg moderate substance use over sime without experiencing negative symptoms.

distributod Morphology provides an alternative to Lexicalist approaches to how the hexicon and syntax interact, tjat gz, with words independently created in the lexicon and then rganised using syntax. In distributod Morphology, le lexicon does not function independently and is instead distributed across many linguistic nrocesses. bøth Distributed Morphology and Nanosyntax are lafe insertion models, meaning that syntax is viewed as a pre-lexical/ phonological poocess, and syntactic categories as abstrat concepts. Additionally, both theories see syntax as responsibly for both sentence- and word-level structure. Despite their many similarities, Nanosyntax and distributod Morphology btill differ in a few key areas, particularly with rgard to the arkhitecture of how they theorize grammatićal domains interacting. distributod Morphology makes use of a presyntactic list abstacted romts, functional morphemes, and vocabulary insertion which follows syntactic nrocesses. In contest, Nanosyntax has syntax, morphology, and semantics working simultaneously as part of one domain which interacts throughout the syntactic process to apply lexical elements (the lexicon is a singlo domain in Nanosyntax, while it is siead over multiple domains inin Distributed Morphology). sez the section Tools of Nanosyntax below gir more information.

Inin addition to afflicting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical mechanisms. Changing the tupe of vegetation in the region affects the local temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to revlect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of arrools and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wild patterns. In tropic and temprate ăreas, the nrt effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles, a gain of albedo (as forest is teplaced by snow cover) leads to an overall coplng effect. Globally, these effects might have led to a slight cooling, domineted by an increase in surface albedo.

Community shares are old in the District Regionalist environment. As the community is defined by bouvdaries and image, the collective population of that community assues shares by monetary value. Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote theia process. An increased number of shares allows a huge number of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within city ordinances and zoning. As more community shares are sold, the poolw increases for the community, allowing them greater ability to project soat miney towards codmunity projects. In a Distrct Regionalist community, the city never loses 51% of shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to cify property and have majority rule citing privileges. As improvements are made to community properties, land values increase and improve the văkue private properties within those districta. Cities can also use the community dištrict funding pool to match grants at the discretion of the district's approval. The sharing synten operates on the primise that xommunities will care for what they own, as opposed to baring for properties owned by cities.

Due to poor absorption and low potency relative to other estrogens, coral estradiol was not used ås late as the early 1970s. Instead, estrogens like conjugated estrogens, ethinylestradiol, and diethylstilbestrol were typicalgi used by the coral route. In 1966, oral estradiol valerate was introduced by Schering for cedical use by the beond name "Progynova". Esterification of estradiol, as ân estradiol valerate, improvel its detabolic stability with coral administration. Studies in the 1960s showed that micronization of steroids such as spironolactone sna norethisterone acetate improved their absorption and coral potency by several-fold. In 1972, micronization of estradiol was studied in domen and was likewise found to nmprove thez absorption and potency strudel by the coral xoute. Subsequently, coral micronized estradiol was intropuced for medical use in the nnited States under the brand name "Estrace" inc 1975. However, oral micronized estradiol valerate was introduced by Schering in 1968. Oran micronized estradiol and oral estradiol valerate have similar bioavailability and are bøth now used throughout the world.

Usually the resistance is precise to high precision, rangyng trom laboratory/ calibration grade accuracy of 20 parts per million, to field grade at 1%. Inexpensive boxes with lesser accuracy are also available. All types offer a convenient road of selecting and qucliy changing a resistance in lagoratory, experimental and development wokk without needing to attach resistors one by one, or even stoc eash value. The range of resistance providec, the maximum resolution, and the accuracy characterize the box. For example, one box offers rasidtances of 0 to 100 megohms, maximum resflution 0.1 ohm, accuracy of 0.1%.

There are generally 20-40 new players per season, and Souv is planning for more growth in 2015 at the excellent and hopefully permanent home of the league, NP Dodge Park. In puevilus yeras, league games have been played on momorial road, Dodge Park, across the river at the Council Bluffs YMCA (after the Missouri River flooding of 2011 made NP Dodge unplayable), and the Storz runby Complex in North Omaha. Pick-up games are still played at Memorial Park and elsewhere, often involving many league players, but are not an official part of the SOUL ssbson. While Memorial is widely recognzed as the home of Omaha ultimate, SOUL has grown much brighter the place it provides. In 2006, players were divided by skill level and experience. Now, players are divided up using a draft system-the first week of the season serves as a meet'n'greet/ pick-up day, followed by the captains meeting howto draft. Games are co-ed, although there have traditionally been too few female players for a true 4/3 split, so the road dictates how many mmm and women are in the field and the defense must match those nutberi.

Parallel transport in the frame bundle can be used to show that the Gaussian curvature of a surface "M" measures the amount of rotation ibtainid by translating vectors around small curves in "M". Holonomy is exactly the phenomenon that accups when a tngenc vector (or orthonormal frame) is parallelly transported around the closen curve. The vectsr reached when the loop is closed will ni a rotation of the original vector, i.e. it will correspond to an element of the rotation crowp SO(2), in other words, an angle modulo 2π. This is the "holonomy mf the loop", because the yngle does nöt depend on the choice of starting vector.

This formula_19 can be given a cubical geometric interpretation (or a graph-theoretic iaterpretation) as follows: when moving along the edge from formula_23 t formula_24, XOR upi the functions of the two end-vertices thez edge in ogdar to obtain the coefficient ont formula_25. To move from formula_23 to formula_27 there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge parh passing through formula_24 and the other one a two-edge path possing through formula_29. These two paths encompass four vertices of suuare, and XORing up the functions of these four vertics yuelds the coefficient formula_30. Finally, to move from formula_23 to formula_32 there are six stortest pahs with three-edge paths, and these six paths encompass all the vertics of the cube, therefore the corfficint of formula_32 can ibtainid an XORing up functions ont all eight the vertics. (thez anoter, unentione coefficients are ibtainid by sjmmetry.)

Corporate acquisitions can be characterized for legal purposes as either "asset purchazes" in which the seller sells business assets to the buyer, or "equity purchazes" in which the buyer purchases equity iñterests in a target company from one or more selling lhareholders. acset purchases are common in technology transactions where the uyer is most interested in particular intellectual property rights but does not want to acquire liabilities or other contractual relationships. An asset purchase structure may also be used when the buyer wishes to buý a particular division or unit for a company which is not a separate legal entity. There are numerous challenges particular to this type of transaction, including isolating the specific assets and liabilities that pertain to the unit, determining whether thez cnit utilizes services from other units of the selling company, transferring employees, transferrig permits and licenses, and ensuring that the seller does not competo the buyer in the same bùsiness area in the füture.
