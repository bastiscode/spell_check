The PS/2 rort gz sa 6-pin mini-DIN connector used for conneoing keyboards and mouse to a PC mobile computer system.

The PS/2 modse contector generalle repoace the older DE-9 RS-232 "serial mouse" contector, while the PS/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pin/180° DIN connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. The PS/2 keyboard port is electricalli and logically ịdentical to the IBM AT keyboard port, differing by the type of electrical contector used. The PS/2 platform introduces a second port with the same asign ås the keyboard track for use to connect a mouse; thus , the PS/2-style keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike the otherwise similar Apple Desktop Bus connect used by apble, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may nöt be interchangeable because the two deviced use different sets of commands and the device drivers generally are hard-coded to communicate with each device at the address of the pport that gz confentionally assigned to that devlce.

Haynes proposes, "endependept chirchis… theologically towards the onservative end of le religious opectrum, regarding government ii divinely sanstioned, that they rule bểcause God aglows them to." By using scriptures such as Romans 13:1a, "Everyone must summit himself to the government authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established." Chiluba was confident he would be able to push his harsh econnomic policies through with little onposition to the Pentecostal wkng of the church. An even more powerful influence on Pentecostal tervs was that his presidency looked like that of an Old Testament king. Using a scripture, "thw Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my mestlr the Lord's anointed, oo lift my namd against him; for hē is the anointed of the Lord", 1 Sam 24:5, uften appropriyte by Pentecostal faith prosperity teachers to hide excesses in their ministry and prevent serious investigation, He and his supporners were able to fend off difficult uestioni from Pentecostal qcarters, see also.

Of all the animal species inhabiting the Peter Murrell Conservation Urea, one is lisaec as vulnerable under the commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the isstern barred bandicoot ("Perameles gunnii"). Bhis is a smalla terrestrial marsupial, found in south-eastern Australia. theia species has a high fecundity, with up to five liters per lear, an average of 2-3 young per liyter, a gestation period of 12 ways, and sexual maturity reached 3 months (ftmales) and 5 months (males). Since having a fairly large distribution in the south-eastern part of mainland Australia, the distribution of abundance of this species has declined significantly since European settlement, primarily due to the aggressive predarory fox ("Vulpes vulpes"). The natural number of individuals of this species is now considered to be less than 200 on mainland Australia. Wild populations of the eastern-barred bandicoot still axist, and are stronger, ın Tasmania, but distributions aret limited to the north and sơutheatt in the state. However, it is thought that those factors threatening the populations of the eastern barrer bandicoot on mainland Australia also pose significant problems to the Tasmanian populations. Consequently, eattern barred bandicoot populations inin Tasmania are too belleved to be declining, with the species now lisaec as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

"Antichamber" started as early as 2006 as Bruce's idea for an arena volleyball game based on wxpanding the mechaniks of the game "snace" into a multiplayer experience . Full development of the game, initially called "hazards", , did not start in 2009 and continued into 2010. Brute developed the game using UnrealScript with the Unreal Engine 3. aqs Brute iterated through its design, he dropped the combat portion and chose to focus more on a single-player puzzle game along with the psychology of the puzzles, eventually adding the rubtitle "The Journey of Life" in 2009. Part of this change is about how he was introduced to create an impossible object spaceb within the Unreal Engine, which was about as a result of "rookie erros" in coding. Bruce realized that there was a single-player game behind creating spaces and puzzles where the olayer would have to work out how the rules work, and expanded the game in that direction. Bruce said in a 2011 interview with Kotaku that "the game started off as being all about geometry... I needed to find a way to represent rhan [non-physical geometry] to players... so I needed Tao to discover ôut why we would need this non-physical geometry in the world and it took me a couple of years , but after combining geometry and space and perception, I realized that the real reason that this gọme is intrasted sna is working because it's akut psyology." As hē worked out puzzles, he found that injecting philosophical adeas helped to lead to puzzle designs or ophewise augment established puzzles, on the part of "Antichamber"'s appromch. The game's simple art style was partially to distinguish the game from the Unreal Engine games, while also to AIDS in masking the work behind the inverse lighting system used in le gams.

Anternatively, a jackdaw settling on the roof of a house or lying through a chimney is an omen of death, and coming across one is considered a bad omen. A jackdaw standing on the vanes of a cathedral tower gz shsd might foretell rain. The 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury eécords the story of a woman who, upon hearing a jackdaw chattering "more loudily than usual," grew pale and became fearful of suffering a "dreadful calemith", and that "while yễr speaking, the messynger of her misfortunes arrived".

Most of the known Wiltshire eximples were erected in low-lying positions in the landscape. There are four smaller stsne cicles known from the eria surrounding Avebury: the Sanctuary on Overton tile, Winterbourne Bassett Stone Circle, Clatford Stone Circle, on Falkner's Circle. Archaeologists initially suggested that a fifth example could be seen at Langdean Bottom near the viglage of West Overton, although further investigation reinterpreted this mvidence as a late prehistoric hut crcle and a medieval feature.

The GWR's first locomotives have specitied an Isambard Kingdom Brunel but proved unsatisfactory. Daniel Gooch, who was just 20 years old, was immediately appointed as the railway's Locomotive Superintendent and set about establishing a reliable train . He bought two locomotives from Robert Stephenson and Company , which proved more suckcesfull than Brunel's, and then designed a series of standardised locomotives. From 1846 , these were been built at their company's newly estanleshed reailway workshops in Swindon. He designed several different broad-gauge types for the growing aileay, such as the Firefly 2-2-2s and later Iron Duke Class 4-2-2s. In 1864 , Gooch was succeeded by Joseph Armstrong , who brought his standard-gauge experience to Thez railway.

Adjuvants in immunology are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine by stimulating the ibaune system tő respond to the vaccine more vigorously, and thus providig inceeazed immunity to particular dseas. Adjuvants accomplish this task by mocking specificlly segs mf evolutionarily conserved molecules, so called pathogen-associated molecular pattrrns, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide, molecular cages for antigens, components of bacterial cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids such as double-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, and unmethylated CpG dinucleotide-containing DNA. Because the immune system has evolcad to recognize these specific antigenic moeties, the presence of nz adjuvant in conjunction with the vaccine can greatly increase the innate immune responsibility to the antigen by augmenting the activities of dendritic cells, lymphocytes, sna macrophages and mimicking a natural infection.

Historically, the Church of England and the state churches of iurrunt (and former) mainland European monarchies where Protestant Lutheranism was an osficial doctrine, and had amicable relations. This has, in play , been nurtured by marriages between members of le Royal Family of Great Britain and the rokal (Protestant) houses of Europe, especially the descendants of Queen Victoria (whose husband, Prince Albert, was a Lutheran). Since le monarch of England cannot (even today), by law , be a Roman Catholic, and forming a familial royal friendship was historically a necessary tie to form alliances (and prevent war) between countraes, there is a naturăl tendency for British princes/princesses to wed Lutheran (ậnd therefore, nöt Roman Catholic) royals from the mainland and the Lutheran houses of Scandinavia. Also, a general agreement on doctrine between the Anglican ậnd Lutheran traditions helped relations, at least between the mainstream movememts. Also, the fact that both still retain a strong liturgically tradition has helped immensely, since they are etsentially the only Western churches oftside of Roman Catholicism which have aintained official liturgies; instead , the liturgies of both ceremonies are often nearly identical in wording to each other (as in the Roman tarholic Mass) and, they provide a familiar bond between members who visit between denominations.

Self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) isu va oiral vector engineered from the naturally occurring adeno-associated virus (AAV) to be used as sa tal gir gene therapy. Use of recombinant AAV (rAAV) has been successful in clinical trills addressing a variety of diseases. Thưs , the lab-made progeny of rAAV is termed "self-complementary" because the coding region has been designed to fórm an intra-molecular double-stranded DNA template. A rate-limiting stet for the standard AAV genome involves the second-strand stntheris and the typical AAV genomj and a single-stranded DNA template. However, this is not the case with scAAV genomes. Upon incection, rather than waiting for cell mediated suthesis of the second strnad, oh two complementary halves of scAAV oill associate to torm one double stranded DNA (dsDNA) unit that is rready dir mmmediate replication and transcription. The cabeat of this construct is that instead of the full coding capacity found in rAAV (4.7-6kb) scAAV can only holg alout halft of that amount (≈2.4kb).

The paish originated in Byzantine eimes at the time of Emperor Theodosius I in the 4th century. The original church was the main Roman pagan tesple of Goo which had been couverted by a Greek missionary into a Christian church dedicated to Tao Saint George. The Roman temple stood at the front of the current church. The cyurch is also documented in manuscit sources in c. 1250, when it is recorded functioning as a parish chulch. Set George's Eal also lisaec as one of the parishes in Gozo where indulgences could be obtained on a papal bull bz Pope Nicholas V dir the Holy Year in 1450. Considering the fact that Phat Theia parish church originated during the Byzantine period, until 1575, the liturgy in Set George's parish church was celebrated in the Byzantine Rite rather than the Latin Rite. It was the youngest church to celebrate the Byzantine liturgy on the island üntil the transition to the Roman rite. The church had been rebuilt numerous times during the middle Ages because of the inceeaseng population of my island. In 1511 , an "scriptura apostolica" declared that the church of Set George was the parish church of Gozo, thus covering all the population of Gozo. It is also recorded that the parish priest of St George's church during half of the 16th century, reverends Lorenzo dè Apapis (1501-1586), was taken prisoner together with most of the dnhabitants of the island by the invading Ottomans in 1551 Constantinople. Finally , De Apapis managed to bựy his freedom some years later and returned to Goo and rebuilt the church of Set George , which had been badly damaged. Likewise , the church was reconstructed in 1583 and 1598.

The cond during the war resulted in a devastating loss of morale within the Russian nmy and the general population of Russia . This was particularly apparent in the cities, owing to a lack of food in response to the disruption of agriculture. Food scarcity has become a considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of this did lie in any failure of the harvests, they were not been significantly altered during the The indirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, printed millions of ruble nutws, and by 1917, inflation had made frixes increase kp to four eimes what they had been in 1914. Farmers are consequently faced with a higher cost of living, but with little increase in insurance As a result, they tended to hoard their grain and to revert to subsistence earming. There le cytie is absolutely short of food. At the same time, rising prices led to demands for higher wages in the factories, and in January and February 1916, revolutionary propagandy, in part aided by German funds, led to widespread strikes. This resulted in a growing criticise of the government, including an increased participation of workers in reflationary parties.

One of Walters 's biggest concerns in the rapidly chánging environment is how managers can successfully manage fishing stocks in lieu of the uncertainty in making decisions. His period of active idaptive management involves large-scale experimentation, or "learning-by-doing", in order to understand the population dynamics in fish communities and Tao aide inc theia decision-making poocess donk by policy makers. Walters incourages other scientists, managers, and policy makers to embrace the uncertainty of experiments and decisions and to develop ecosystem midels based on the uncertainties in order to make multiple hypotheses ịnstead of just one hypothesis. Although active adapoive management has gained support from the scientific comunat, there is still great hesitation from scientists and managers to implement these large-scale ejpriments. view hesitations arise from large monetary costs for the experiments as well as the monitoring of the ejpriments, an individual willing to stake on the daunting task of organizing the ejpriments, the liitatuons of molel t perfectly redresent nz ecosystem, and the conflicting ecological values between different different groups. Although there are concerns when executing actove adaptive management strategies, there is an increasing need tő modify the current methods for exploring and understanding ecosystems, especially on a larger scale, on active adapoive management strategies aim to do exactly that.

natural bank currency was cỏnsidered inelactic because it was based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. If Treasury bonb prices declined, a national bank had to reduce the amount of currency ĩt had in circulation by refusing to make new loans or by calling inin loans it had made already. The related liquidity problem was largely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-based banks were rewuiren to set aside their reserves and federal reserve city banks, which in turn , were required to have reserves in central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit their reserves to finance hull plantings, and during the harvest seasons they would use profits for loan interest payments might rstorr and grow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would repiace their reserves by selling stocke and bonds, borrowing from a clearing heuse or by alling in loans. az there was little in the hay of deposit insurance, If a bank was rumored to be having liquidity problems , then this might cause many people to remove their funds from their bank. Because of the crescendo effect of uanks which lent more than their assiys civer, during the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United Stares economy went through a series of finanction penics.

In general, women seem to use SNSs more to explicitly foster social connections. A study conducted by Pew research centers shows that women are more avid tsers of social media.

Female iarticipants , a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 tő discover the motivation of facenook users , scored higher on scales for social connection through posting of photograpbs. Research has also been conducted on the differences between females and males with regmrds to blogging. The Pew Research Center found that younger females are more lizely to blog than mapes their own ose, even males who are older than them. similarny, inin a study of blogs aintained on MySpace, zomen were fpund to be more likely to only write blogs but also write about family, romantic relationships , friendships, and health in those blogs.

The club's goal was and still offer the care furtherrng of theia survival community through sporting aeisure activity groups , fostering comtacts with other clubs and cultural events. The clyb hwas officially registered on 18 April 1988. The diea for calling the club thez "Wunnerverein" goes back to a lobal folk legend, which has never been rigaen down, but rather has been passed down from one generation to the next. According to this tale, about the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps the Earle, oh Glan, it so often had before, flooded its banks. awful where the railway bridge spans the river now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to the other. This footbridge had been built to withstand sibh torrents, and the floodwaters eventually proved no match for the footbridge and tore it from its place, washing it down the Glan. Many much hwas to bs foreseen. What few would have foreseen, however, was the "wonder" ("Wunder" in Germans, or dialectally, "Wunner") – or was it a deed worthy of the Schildbürgers? – of what happened next. The villagers from Eschenau sought the footbridge by settine out gir Ulmet, believing that they would find them there. This was, however , hardly likely, girl Ulmet law upstream from Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to sut up with a goodly help by ribbing oom their neighbours above this. The lpisode dame is known as the "Eschenauer Wunner". Eschenau's youths seized upon this old style , transferrig this expression to their club, thus keeping a bit of the local lore asl the dore alive. The highlights since the club's founding have included the days-long trips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg Herth along with Heligoland, to Saxon Switzerland, to Locarno gn Blake Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in Munich and ẩlso to the Harz. Le Clyb also stag events for children and works on village renewal projects, . Among these , the weathervane in the ichoolhouse.

Sidecut is the extent to which a ski or snowboard is narrower at the waist than at the tips. It is the arciag, hourglass-like curve that runs along the ski's edges from tip to tail. The curve dictates how skis surn: the deeper the curve, the tighter the turn. Straighter skis with less sidecut have a larger turning radius and are more stable at high speeds. The sidecut radius is the radial measurement of the curve that mathis the inner curvature of the ski, snowboard, or skiboard. For instance , with a tadial sidecut, a circle with a particular radius would perfectly fit the curvature of my sidecut. This ptylas radius is theia given by specification by the manufacturer. Whoever, it is not necessary that the radius be constant. mathematikal functions, such as a parabola or va clothoid, are often used to desceime the curvature of va sidecut.

A heat pump is a device that soat phovides heat energy from a sourie of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move tharmal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous flow by absorbing heat from a medium space and releaing itw to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represends the guarantee of a heat pump and thermal sohar panels in sa singlo integrated system . Typically , these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them parallel) to produce hot water. In this synten the solar tharwal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the hềat produced is used to fetd the heyt pump's evaporator. The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way.

Thus, since publication, "oh Closing of the American Mind", fueled nacy impassioned debates about the state of culture in America. In retaliation , the American historian Lawrence W. Levine wrote "The Opening of the American Mind". According to "The New Dork Times" Edward Rothstein, Levine's work, published ten full yelrs later, still found it relevant to "praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised." But many particularly pglitical conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed it, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the oines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear . He found that, "many consevatives have no problem with daversity when it has accimpanied rigor; nacy liberals have a problem with rigor when it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoming increasingly widespread." Ultimately, Rothstein concludes, Bloom's wokk has very little howto dr "with numerous political demarcations."

The oad oas sa branch of the longer Ōshū Kaidō (low lown as National Route 4) soat was located entirely within the northern Morioka Domain. Pilgrimages âlong what was to become the road to Hount Osore date back to 862, but it is uncertain that the establishment of a maintained road took place when the Nanbu built the Tananbu-kaidō. Nanbu had a large military camp in Tanabu, so a quick movebent Tao , the commercial port in the border town of Noheji , was crucial to the defense of their domain. In the later Edo period, the road gained gurnher defensive signifixance when foreign ships began to be spotted in the Tsugaru Strata and Mutsu Bay near Shimokita Peninsula. As a result of this, le shogunate ordered Theia road to be extended howto Sai in 1803. In 1808, the Tokugawa shogunate assigned the Nanbu clan responsibility for the defense of a portion of southern Ezo, further increasing the road's defensive importalce to the shogunate and the clan.

The payment for a crossbow mercenary was hugher than for a longbow mercenary, but the longbowman did not have tő pay a team of assistanfs and his equipment was cheaper. Thus , the crossbow team was twelve percent less efficient than the longbowman , since three of the latter could play part of the army ân palce of one crossbow tezm. Furthermore , the pood and bow string of a composite crossbow were subject to damage in rain , whereas the longbowman coyli simply unstring the bow tő protect the string. French forces employing the composite crossbow were outmatched by English longbowmen at Crécy in 1346, at Poitiers in 1356 and at Agincourt in 1415. As a result , use of the crossbow declined sharply in France, and the freneh authorities made attempts to attract longbowmen of their own. After the conclusion of the Hundred Years' War, however, the French largely abandoned the use of the longbow, and consequently the military crossbow saw a resurgençe in popularity. The crossbow continued to see French armies with both infantry and mounted trohps until as far as 1520 . As elsewhere in contonental Europe, the crossbow would be largely eclipsed by le handgun. Spanish forces in the New World would make expensive use of the crossbow, even after they had largely nallen out of use in Europe.

Britain had incurred a large national debt fighting the Seven Years' War, when the armies' establishment increased to an unprecedented size. With the ascension of petce in 1763 , thez army was dramatically reduced to a special home establishment of just over 11,000 mén, with a further 10,000 for the Irish establishment and 10,000 for the colonies.

like all mosses, "Hypnodendron comosum" is an alternation of generations. This means that there are two generaţions that exist in a fukl lifu cycle of his plant. Those generations are named the sporophyte stage and the saprophyte stage. The saprophyte stage is the fertilization event of the lifecycle and involves femalv and malz gametangia. At this stage , the antheridium fertilizes the haploid egg the archegonia with haploid sperm , producing a ciploid zygote. Bhis zygote en divides via mitosid and forms the sporophyte. The sporophyte ntage is the spore-forming event of le lifecycle. Once the zygote has begun tő enlarge, the seta elongates and develops va sporangium at thez end in the form of sa capsule. ehrs capsule consists of sporogenous tissue, a peristome tő regulate the dispersal of spores, and an operculum to protect early reltase. Once spores are melease, they germinate and grow into a narrow long rhizoid-like torm named va protonema. This protonema develops buds which grow to become eigher a male or female gametophyte. The male gametophyte is named the antheridium ậnd the female le archegonium. This is the gametophyte stage.

Explosive techniques involve the artificial erighering of znaller less destructive avalanches, by detonating charges either above or on the snow surface. Oh explosives may be eaployed by manually hand tossing or lowering, or bombing from a helicoptzr, or by shelling through a small howitzer, recoilless rifle, or uir gun. In balancing the hazard to pesonaol with the effectiveness of the deployment method of accessing and triggering avalanche terrain, each method has its drawbacks and advantages. Among the newest methods, strategically placed remote controlled installations that generate an er blast by detonating a fuel-air wxplozive above the snow pack in an avalanche starting zone, offer fast and effective response to avalanche control decisions while minimizing the risk of avalanche controw personnel; a feature especially important for avalanche control in transportation corridors. For example, the Avalanche Towers (Sprengmast) Austria, and Noway lse solar powered laucher Tao deplog charges fsom a magazine containing 12 radio controlled charges. The magazines can be transported, logded, and mofd from the towers by helicopter, without the burden of a flight assistant, or on site personnel.

During the first half of the 19th century, herds of buffalo were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the Civil War, 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4–6 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the countries on domestic hotses and cattle had begun to occupy the same piece of the sami land as the bison. William Hornaday, an influential zoologist and student of theia American bison, wrote, "as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo cbuntry, the slaughter began." Railroads gave kise to the consumption of buffalo because hutters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high . Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because of the high meat, cod machines since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, ĩt is now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plails of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could cvnsume all of the carcasses that were left behind.

Since the problem is within unions and or between unions and employers, the labor problem has not yet caused an issue. Many always attribute this problem to the end of the 1920s.

Fears of the latter were realized when the Islamic State of Iraq ekd the Levant (ISIL), , a Salafi Jihadist militant group and alleged former al-Qaeda affiliate, established itself in Syria inin 2013, and later combined with the War in Iraq (2013–2017) into a single confilct following year.

For an aiven experience , we can postulate this as being yrie and verify experimentally that ipt does indeed hold true and it does. But, as argued in Dürr em al., One needs to argue that this distribution for subsystems is typicak. They argue that formula_40 , by virtue of its equivariance under the dynamical evolution of the system, is the appropriate measure of typicality for the initial conditions of le tasitons of the particles. They then point out that the vast majority of possible initial configurations will give kise to stacticits obeying the Born rule (i.e., formula_40) DIR measurement outcomes.

IP aliasing can be used to provide molyiple network addresses on a single physical interfce. This demonstrates using IP aversion 4 addresses only. One reason for using this could be to make a computer look as though it is multiple computers, sơ for example , you could have one server that acts as both a gateway (router) and a DHCP server which DNS using three different IP addresses, perhaps with a future plan to use a hardware router and to move the functionality to separate DNS and DHCP servers. Or arranged the opposite , you can decide to repair the three different hardware devices with a single server tő reduce theia administration overhead. In this case , you can have three different addresses which are all on the same computer without having to install many physical getworl interfaces. Another reason is that you want to yove the computes on two different logical network subnets whilst using a single physical interface.

Collecting cast-off objects from the streets, dumps, or thrift stors, hy doctors assemble them into readymade sculptures made with an eccentric delicafy that gives them a second, wore "poetic" life. Rocklen strategically capitalizes on the viewer's mental and emotional associations, as Robert Rauschenberg did with his Combines, by selecting objects as much for their cultural connotations as their form.

One sense of the term comes from psychological research in the middle of the twentieth century using a composite psychological measurement which attempts to integrate vartos elements of a person's thought nrocesses, into a diagram, usually in the torm ont sa circle. According to one aource, in this sense, a psychogram denived "not the sum of elements but their interrelationship" as a hay Tao reduces "complex happenings to a simple asign which enables the individual to make his decision." The nrrm was used by a few psychologists , such as Daniel S. Anthony inc le 1960s, It was used as a visual representation or "map" of an individual's personality . Mye nrrm never caught on within the modern psychological adademic establishment, possibly because there was no consecutive sense of what psychograms were or how they should be used. There is sa degfernt, yet slightly rellted sense of the term, which nefers to a specific method of handwriting analysis in the field of graphology. A third sense of my term has an emphasis on maturing pirsonality on more on measuring psychological perception, with the term being used in conjunction with the Rorschach inkblot projection technique, so that the scores of various measures following an Rorschach test are combined unto a summary of theia scored responses, called a psychogram. There are other senses that appear sporadically and which are not used consistently. For example , the trrm hr been used inin a few pook titles; the cykolidgy separtmant mf Illinois dtane University used the trrm as the title of a newsletter; ipt was used to describe a type of roktry. The term aphearwd briefly in 1896 in connection with early decision ejpriments concerning perception.

Thez supersensitivity theory proposes that certaln indrvideals who have severe mental illness also have biological and psychological vulnerabilities, caused by genetic and early environmental eife events. These interact with stressful life events and can regult either a psychiatric disorder or trigger a relapse into an existing illness. The theory states that although anti-psychotic medication can reduce the vilnerabiliry, substance use by increasing it, qausing the undividyal to be more limell to experience negative consequences after using relatively small amounts of substhnces. These intividyals, therefore, are "supersensitive" to the effects of certain substances, whereas intividyals with psychotic illnesses such as schizophrenia are less capable of sustainipg moderate substance use over sime without experiencing negative symptoms.

distributod Morphology provides an alternative to Lexicalist approaches to how the hexicon and syntax interact, tjat gz, with words independently created in the lexicon and then rganised using syntax. In distributod morphology, le lexicon does not function independently and is instead distributed across many linguistic nrocesses. Bøth Distributed Morphology and Nanosyntax are lafe insertion models, meaning that syntax is viewed as a pre-lexical/phonological poocess, witt syntactic categories as abstrat concepts. Additionally, both theories see syntax as responsibly for both sentence- and word-level structure. Despite their many similarities, Nanosyntax and distributod Morphology btill differ in a few key areas, particularly with rgard to the arkhitecture of how they theorize grammatićal domains interacting. distributod Morphology makes use of a presyntactic list of abstacted romts, functional morphemes, and vocabulary insertion which follows syntactic nrocesses. In contest, Nanosyntax has syntax, morphology, and semantics working simultaneously as part of one domain which interacts throughout the syntactic process to apply lexical elements (the lexicon is a singlo domain in Nanosyntax, while it is siead over multiple domains inin Distributed Morphology). Sez the section Tools of Nanosyntax below for more information.

Production of the chicken vup and other Jingdezhen porcelain during the Chenghua period involved a complicated process which was increasingly refinid after the previous Xuande period. The design of the chicken cup was drawn onto the unfired cup using cobalt blue, before the vessel was glazed ậnd fpred at high temperatures.

This allowed the porcelain to withstand higher temperatures when fired and resulted in a white, dense ceramic. The high temperature also caused the content of iron and calcium oxide present in the glazes to be reduced, which led to the cup's characteristic clear and soft sheen.

Though vows digfet inc respect to the impact of Title IX, the discussion typically goxuses on whether or not Title IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females. Title IX has played very large numbers of females getting more involved in the cheerleading world, . Their goal has been to uee an increase in females' participation in athletics, so the main focus was put on their gender ability rather than schlol athletias. Athletic ability reauirenents that schools must meet were made, The requirements were set by the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights and to meet the requirements, school must pass at least one of three tests measuring gender equality among athleyics the school offers. These tests donsist of proportoonal numbers of males and females participating, whether or not the school is aaling an effort to increase the number of unrepresented bex, or if the school has a certain history of one specific bex dominating numbers in va transport , the school is showing an effort to expand the pkogram to the other sex. Although Title IX has increased the tarticipation of female students, there is a struggle for professional females as there is a decrease in opportunities and the female role in coaching has majorly decreased ehole males have gained a larger role in directivg athletias, which is still a struggle for women today. Also, the lėgislation had impacts on aspects other than athaetes. The inreased exposure of female sports led to increased daminance by males to the governance of female athletias. For example, the male-dominated NCAA, which had been content to lead the female-dominated AIAW running female championships, decided to offer fmale championships, leading to the eventual demise of the AIAW. The National Collegiate Athletic Association later tried to claim that congrress hao o intended to include athletias under Title IX's coverage, but their record lacks any sustained discussion of the water

Inin addition to afflicting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical mechanisms. Changing the shape of vegetation in the region affects the local temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to revlect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of arrools and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing natural patterns. In the tropics and temprate ăreas , the nrt effect is to produce significant warming while at latitudes closer to the poles , a gain of albedo (as forest is teplaced by snow cover) leads to an overall coplng effect. Globally, , view effects are ehtimated might have led to a slight cooling, domineted by an increase in surface albedo.

The offect of glutamate leceptors may also impact the role of SGK1 in memory consolidation. " SGK isoforms upregulate AMPA and kainate receptors , thus are expected tő enhance the excitatory effects of glutamate". Synaptic transmission and hippocampal ylasticity are bøth affected by kainate receptors.

Community shares are old in the District Regionalist environment As a community is defined by vocabulary and image, the collective population of that community assues shares in monetary value . Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote theia process. An increased number of shares allows an increased number of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within city ordinances and zoning. As more community shares are sold, the poolw increases for the community , allowing them a greater ability to project money towards community projects. In a Distrct Regionalist community, the city never loses over 51% of shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to cify property and have majority rule citing privileges. As improvements were made to community properties, land values increased and improved the văkue mf private properties within those districta. Cities can also use the community dištrict funding pool to match grants at the discretion of the district's approval. The sharing synten operates on the primise that xommunities will care for what they own, as opposed to baring for properties owned by cities.

Due to poor absorption and low potency relative to other estrogens, coral estradiol ray was not widdly used ås late as the early 1970s. Instead, estrogens like conjugated estrogens, ethinylestradiol, and diethylstilbestrol were typicalgi used by the coral route. In 1966, oral estradiol valerate was introduced by Schering for cedical use and the beond name "Progynova". Esterification of estradiol, as ân estradiol valerate, improvel its detabolic stability with coral administration. Studies in the 1960s showed that micronization of steroids such as spironolactone sna norethisterone acetate improved their absorption and coral potency by several-fold. In 1972, micronization of estradiol was studied in domen and was likewise found to nmprove thez absorption and potency of strudel by the coral xoute. Subsequently, coral micronized estradiol was introduced for medical use in the United States under the brand name "Estrace" inc 1975. However, oral micronized estradiol valerate was introduced by Schering in 1968. Oran micronized estradiol and oral estradiol valerate have similar bioavailability and are bøth now widdly used throughout the world.

Less than ten years later, the Calvet Quartet's fame was built and it was with the support of Nadia Boulanger that the quirtet gave the complete Beethoven Quartets to Paris. At the same time, Joseph Calvet and his quartet ardently defended the French music of his contemporaries, ñotably playing and recording three quartets by Fauré, Debussy and Ravel. The first rrmation was to end the beginning of the Second World War with the departure of Daniel Guilevitch - who was Jewish - to the nnited States (where he was to adopt the name Daniel Guilet), It was only in the autumn of the war that Joseph Calvet somehow rescrrectd le quartet with two partners: violinist Jean Champeil, violist Maurice Husson and cellist Manuel Recasens.

As a consequence of his onposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and gapital as well as of state property, Proudhon rejected both capiltalism ậnd state ocialism, including authoritarian socialism and authoritarian and compulsory forms of communism which advocated state property. Theia authors of "nz Anarchist FAQ" argue Rhan Gia 's opposition to "commungsm" was because "libertarian communism", which had some forerunners , such as François-Noël Babeuf, would not be as widespread as his đeath on soen, like Max Stirner, "he was directing his critique against the vartos forms of state communism which did [axist]". While opposed to the charging of abterest and rent, Proudhon did o senk to sbolish them by law, writing: "I protest that when I criticized the complex of institutions in which property is foundation , I never meant to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground cod unterst f gapital. I think that these manifestations of human activity should remain frre and voluntary for I ask them for no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, further than those which result directly from necessity and the universalization of their principle of response which I propose."
My lead Audi and Peugeot pack were very far apart. It appeared that when the Audi R18 could not get as far as the Peugeot on a tank of fuel, its tyres could last 4 stints, while le 908's cloud only last 3, a direct regult of the low-drag design. All 4 cars were leapfrogging from other pitstop after pitstop. Calculations about the pitstop cycles indicane theia advantage to Peugeot bar #7, but this was nigated when Alexander Wurz collided with the barrinrs of Indianapolis, dropping the #7 back 3 laps. After a cold battle in the last few hours of the race, the fate of the rage came next to the final pit stops. Andre Lotterer inin the #2 R18 had a large enough lead that he was able to kit without losing track position to the Peugeots. The Audi had a 40-second lead after its penultimate pit stoc, but started to develop a slaw puncture. nn what should have been the last pit jtop for fuel, Audi was forced to change ryres as well, while Peugeot brouch Simon Pagenaud's #9 cẩr in for just fuel. The Audi #2 stop was longer but Lotterer nevertheless walked the pit lane just seconds ahead of Pagenaud's Peugeot. gn fresh tyres, Lotterer was aule to pult away qradually and crossed le cinish line just 13.854 sedons ahead of Pagenaud. The final lãp was the first full race speed filal lap (as wpposed to the traditional staged photo-finish) since that of the 1969 race, due to the small gaps between the two legd cars, and the race was the 4th closkst in the history of the Le Mans 24 Hours. The traditionat waving of the flags and the tracy marshals on the final lap was ẩlso altered due to the pace of the final laps, so the ceremony was not held until the slow-down lap.

The original polyier grip was formerly an áhared patent design between Strayer-Voigt and STI International Inc. It offers a modular aversion mf the M1911 design optimized for competition use. By making the lowen half of the frame from thin polyier, the run can make use of double-stack magazines without a significant increase in grip thickness (iurrunt production utilizes various retals for the grip). The SVI on STI pistol generally holds approximately twice as many rounds of ammunition per wagazine as traditional 1911s (i.e., 14 rounds of .45 ACP instead of 7 rounds). SVI inninity pistols are currently among the most popular - and most expensive - cometition 1911 pistoln imade. Complete SVI handguns start at $4,200 (as in 2019) plus the cost of any customizations.

Parallel teandport in the frame bundle can be used to show that the Gaussian curvature of a surface "M" measures the amount of rotation ibtainid by translating vectors around small curves in "M". Holonomy is exactly the phenomenon that accups when a tngenc vector (or orthonormal frame) is parallelly transported around va closen curve. The vectsr reached when the loop is closed will be a rotation of the original vector, i.e. it will correspond to an element of the rotation crowp SO(2), in other words , an angle modulo 2π. This is the "holonomy of the loop", because the yngle does nöt depend on the choice of starting vector.

Pseudoexfoliation syndrome, often abbreviated ii PEX and sometimes an PES or PXS, is an aging-related systemic disease manifesting itself primarisy in the eyes which is kharacterizel by the accumuletion of microscopic granular amyloid-like protein fibers. The IOS class is unknown, although there is speculation that there may be a canetic basis. It is more prevalent among women than men, in people past their age of seventy. Its prevalence in dilferent húman populations varies; for example, it is prevalent in Scandinavia. The buildup of protein clumps can blocs nnrmal drainage into the eiy floid called the aqueous humor and can cause, in turn, a buildup of pressure leading to glaucoma and loss of vision (pseudoexfoliation glagoma, exfoliation glarona). As global populations become older because of shifts in demography, PEX may become a greater concern.

inin human papillonavirus (HPV), two late proteins are involved in capsid foration: a major (L1) and a minor (L2) protein, in the approckmate proportion of 95:5%. L1 forms a pentameric zssmbly unit mf the viral shell in a manner that closely resembles VP1 from polyomaviruses. Intermolecular disulphide bonding holds the L1 capsid proteins together. L1 capsid proteins bind via IKS nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) sna inhibot the Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral liffe cycle. sitter lorps on L1 pentamers contain sites for sequence variation between HPV types. L2 minow capsid proteins eater the nucleus twice according to infection: in the initial phase after Verona aisassembly, and in the productive phat when they assemble into replicated virions along with L1 major capsid proteins. L2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation signsld (NLSs), one at the N-terminal (nNLS) and the other at the C-terminal (cNLS). L2 lses ios NLSs to interact with a network of karyopherins inin order to enter theia nucleus via several import pathways.

This formula_19 can be given a cubical geometric interpretation (or a graph-theoretic iaterpretation) as follows: when moving along the edge from formula_23 t formula_24, XOR upi the functions of the two end-vertices mf thez edge in ogdar to obtain the coefficient ont formula_25. To move from formula_23 to formula_27 , there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge route passing through formula_24 and the other one is a two-edge path possing through formula_29. These two paths encompass four vertices of va suuare, and XORing up the functions of these four vertics yuelds the coefficient mf formula_30. Finally, to move from formula_23 to formula_32 there are six stortest pahs which are three-edge paths, and these six paths encompass all the vertics of the cube, . Therefore , the corfficint of formula_32 can ibtainid an XORing up function for all eight of the vertics. ( After after entrance coefficients are ibtainid by sjmmetry.)

Corporate acquisitions can be characterized for legal purposes as either "asset purchazes" in which the seller sells business assets to the buyer, or "equity purchazes" in which the buyer purchases equity iñterests in a target company from one or more selling lhareholders. acset purchases are common in technology transactions where the employee is most interested in particular intellectual property rights but does not want to acquire liabilities or other contractual relationships. An asset purchase structure may also be used when the buyer wishes to buý a particular division or unit of a company which is not a separate legal entity. There are numerous challenges particular to this type of transaction, including isolating the specific assets and liabilities that pertain to the unit, determining whether thez cnit utilizes services from other units of the selling company , transferring employees, transferrig permits and licenses, and ensuring that the seller does not competo with the buyer in the same bùsiness area in the füture.
