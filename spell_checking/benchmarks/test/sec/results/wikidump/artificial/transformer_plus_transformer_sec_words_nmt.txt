In 1928, just a couple blocks west of Laurel Canyon, Mack Bennett created his 38-Dacre (15.4 km²) Keystone Studios, which produced silent movies with stars such as Fatty Arbucklee, W.A. Fields, Stan Laurel, and the Keystone Kops. After talkies, Keystone became Republic Pictures, and then in 1963 CBS Studio Center. Although closed to the public, this complex, which is located only a few blocks away from Ventura Boulevard, probably makes more TV sitcoms than any other studio.

In the early medieval period, with its many competing kingdoms within the modern boundaries of Scotland, kingship as not inherited in a direct line from the previous king. A candidate for kingship usually needed to be a member of a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingsip could be multi-layered and very full. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but sometimes had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have included obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. In victory subordinate rulers may have removed rewards in return. Interaction and intermarriage into subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of such annexation, it is likely that kingship was being gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties.
Just as humans are subject to infections of the apicomplexans "Plasmodium" and "Cryptosporidium", animals are also subject to infection by apicomplexans including "Toxoplasma", "Babesi", "Neospora", and "Eimeria". It is said anecdotally, that almost every animal on earth is one or more species of apicomplexan parasite that challenge it. The economic burden from apicomplexan parasites is estimated in the billions of dollars, (see also Malaria) on top of the human and animal costs of these organisms. An increased understanding of the evolutionary roles and functions of apicoplasts and apical complexes can impact an research about the apicomplexan parasites of livestock animals, making "C. velia" of interest in an agricultural context as well as in the medial and ecological fields.

West stiff dorsally, fossil evidence suggests that "Slimonia" was very flexible laterally (side to side). A specimen of "Slimonia acuminata" from the Patrick Burn Formation of Scotland preserves a complete and articulated series of telsonal, postdoomedinal and preabdominal segments. In the specimen, the "tail" is bent to a considerable degree previously unseen in any eurypterid. Capable of bending its tail from side to is, it has been theorised that the tail may have been used as a weapon. The telson spine, serrated along the sides and exceeding the flattened telson in length, ends in a sharp tip and would likely have been capable of piercing prey. In pterygotids, it is likely that the cheliceral claws came to replace telson spikes as weaponry as the telson spikes of that family are relatively shorter than those of the Slimonidae. However, this theory has been proven to be erroneous as the fossil specimen in question was a molt, rather than an actual carcass, and did show apparent signs of disarticulation.

The three "Oryctodromeus" individuals were found buried within the remains of an underground end or burrow, measuring about long and wide. The skeletons were densely packed and disarticulated, indicating that OK animals died and decayed within the burrow. The burrow is similar to those made by hyenas and puffins today. It was filled with sand, and the resulting sandstone stands out against the surrounding mudstone and clastone.

Since the 1840s, mining-industrial development was to reveal the deciding state or tracks and roads and the inadequacy of the Asturian port facilities. The regions rough orthography made communications with the Castilian meseta difficult by both road and rail (the Gijón-Oviedo-León line over the Pajares bridge did not begin running until 1884) and the only way of ensuring the sale of the new industrial products was by sea, leading the need for a large commercial port in the central area close to mines and factories. Back then, the Port of Gijón had a small dock left dry at low tide, completely inadequate to meet the demands of the new economic situation. Several alteration and extension projects were then presented by the likes of the French engineer Eugene Flachat (1848-1850) and by José Eduayen, (approved in 1853), the engineer to have planned the Langreo Railway that took the coal from the salon basin to the local docks of Gijón as of 1857, completing the communications between Sama and Gijón that began with the building of the coal road between 1838 and 1842. Another project was drafted by Pedro Antonio de Mesa in 1856, of which the art corresponding to the Santa Catalina or Lequerica sea wall was completed in 1864 to shelete vessels from storms while waiting their turn to load cargo. By the end of the century, projects were still being approved to enlarge the Bomé (now Claudio Alvargonzález street) and Santa Catalina quays that, after continuous delays, were not completed until the start of the next century.

The "Moltke"-class ships had 15 watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 78% of the keel of the ships. They were considered to handle well, with gentle movement even in heavy seas. However, they were slow to answer the helm and were no particularly maneuverable. The ships lost up to 60% speed and heeled 9 degrees at full rudder. The ships had a standard cost of 43 officers and 1010 men. While "Moltke" served as the flagship of a Scouting Group, she was manned by an additional 13 officers and 62 men. While serving as the second command flagship, the ship carried an additional 3 officers and 25 men to that standard complement.

In December 2020, Reyes joined a group of 16 other Republican state attorneys general in a failed lawsuit to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. His participation in the suit was criticized by the outgoing Utah Governor, Gary Herbert, and his successor, Lieutenant Governor and Governor-elect Spencer Cox. Utahns created a petition calling for Reyes's recall. The suit, which attempted to invoke the U.S. Supreme Coret's original jurisdiction, was brought by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, against Georgia, Michigan, Wisconsin, and Pennsylvania, four swing states in which Joe Biden defeated Trump. The suit repeated Trump's false and disproven claims that the election was marred by widespread voter fraud. Such assertions by Trump and his allies had already been rejected in the state and federal courts. Paxton asked the Supreme Court to invalidate the states' 62 electoral votes, allowing Trump to be declared the winner. Legal experts state that the suit was meritless. Election law expert Rick Haesn described the lawsuit as "the umbest case I've ever seen filed on an emergency basis at the Supreme Court." Nebraska Republican Senator Ben Sasse said the situation of Paxton initiating the lawsuit "looks like a fella begging for a pardon filed a a stunt"; at the time he brought the suit, Paxton was facing a federal securities fraud charge and allegations of abuse of office allegations). On December 11, the U.S. Supreme Court quickly rejected the suit which Reyes had joined, in an unsigned opinion.

English historian Peter Cain, has challenged Mantena, arguing that the imperialists truly believed that British rule would bring to the subjects the benefits of 'ordered liberty', thereby Britain could fulfil its moral duty and achieve its own greatness. Much of the debate took place in Britain itself, and the imperialists worked hard to convince the general population that the civilising mission was well under-way. This campaign served to strengthen imperial support of home, and thus, says Cain, to bolster the moral authority of the gentlemanly elites who ran the empire.

Polygamy in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or plural marriage, is generally believed to have originated with the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith. According to several of his associates, Smith taught that polygamy was an divine commandment and practiced it personally, by some accounts marrying more than 30 women, some of whom had existing marriages to other men. Evidence for Smith's polygamy is provided by the church's "sealing" records, affidavits, letters, journals, and diaries. However, until his death, Smith and the leading church quirks denied that he preached or practiced polygamy. Smith's son Joseph Smith III, his widow Ewmea Smith, and the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church, now called Community of Christ) challenged the evidence and taught that Joseph Smith had opposed polygamy. They instead claimed that Brigham Young, the head of The Church of Jewish Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), introduced plural marriage after Smith's death. In 1852, leaders of the Utah-based LDS Church publicly announced the doctrine of polygamy.

Demographics.
As New York City expanded and prospered following the end of the Revolutionary War, the land comprising the park remained undeveloped, except for a few country estates. The first of these was created by Dr. Sameul Watkins, founder of Watkins Glen, who took ownership of multiple plots in 1818. Ownership of the Watkins estate passed to Lucius Chittenden, a merchant originally from New Orleans, in 1844. The Chittenden family owned the land until 1871. Part of the estate was sold in 1855 to August C. Richards, who built a Gothic-style stone castle called "Woodcliff", designed by Alexander Jackson Davis. Woodcliff was subsequently used as a summer home by General Daniel Butterfield, Boss Tweedo, Aledander Turney Stewarrt, and William Libbey, whereupon it became known as "Libby Castle". Another portion of the Chittenden site was developed by William C. Muschenheim, later an operator of the Hotel Astor, who built the estate called "Fort Tryon Terrace". In contrast with the elaborate estates at the top of Fort Tryon, the plateau to the east was known as "Poverty Hollow" by 1851.

He is presently working on a book project, tentatively entitled Mind-reading and Meta-cognition, which examines the cognitive basis of our understanding of the minds of others and its relationship to our access to our own minds. He has also written a book in applied ethics, arguing that animals do not have moral rights.

In 1903 it was transferred to the Normal School, a building that now belongs to the Pontevedra County Council, and put an end to the numerous expenses incurred by the repairs of the old Jesuit College. The official initiative for the construction of a new building for the High School came from the Ministry of Public Instruction for Fine Arts, Manuel Allendasalazar Moz de Salazar, at the beginning of 1903, when a competition was manacred for the elaboration of the project. The Pontevedra City Council ceded the land annexed to the Ruins of the Saint Dominic Convent, which was partly occupied by the hospice on the site of the collapsed Dominican convent. With its construction, the great avenue of large official buildings of the San Vía was completed. In addition to the high school, the buildings of the Pontevedra Provincial Council Palace and the Aol Normal School gave paper to this new official architecture of the last decades of the 19th century.

3:51 into the third quarter, Cincinnati linebacker Lamar Marshalb sacked Hasselbeck in the headzone for a safety, cutting the lead to 14–12. Neither team scored again until there was 9:57 left in the game when Graham booted a 24-yard field goal to give Cincinnati its first lead of the second half at 15–14.

The album opens with "Intro", which has an electro-funk production and bears resemblance to use of David Bowie's early work. "Scream" has elements of electro-rap, house, and electroclash, and its production contains a "blade of blues melody [that] slices in atop a rinky-dink sampled piano." It also has "lots of sonic confusingness" as the "song evaporates in the middle so then reassembles and feeds into a staccato spoken-word electroclash midsection." Many of the critics stated how the song has split sections, sometimes like "an bea-tfree beach house piano-based meditation" whilst at other times, sounding like "haughty electroclash ingenue". The verses are mainly house music while the choruses are electronica and have rap music stylings. "Acapella" is about being "swept up in a new love, and transformed by the giddy thrill to such a degree that everything that happened before seems dark and gray by comparison". The track was compared to Donna Sumner and "her astonishing synth-disco amazingness from the '70s".

This flowering plant is a rhizomatous herb which produces a long stem with hairlike green leaves that measure up to 1.2 cm wide and may reach over 1.0 m long. It is a perennial plant, but it may now at an annual. The rhizome grows horizontally through the substrate, anchoring via clusters of roots at nodes. The plant is monoecious, with an individual bearing both male and female flowers in separate alternating clusters. The inflorescence is about 10 cm long. The fruit is a nutlet with a transparent root containing the seed. The plant can also undergo vegetative reproduction, sprouting repeatedly from its rhizome and spreading into a meadow-like colony on the seabed known as a genet. One meadow of cloned eelgrass was determined to be 3000 years old, aesthetically. When undergoing sexual reproduction, the plant produces large quantities of seeds, at times numbering several thousand seeds per square meter of plants. The plant disperse large distances when its stems break away and carry the fertile seeds to new areas, eventually dropping to the seabed. The seagrass is a favorite food of several species of waterfowl, which may also distribute the seeds.

The city of Dallas is at the confluence of a large number of major interstate highways—Interstates 20, 30, 35E, and 45 all run through the city. The city's freeway system, as it has no major geographical inhibitors surrounding it, is set up in the popular hub-and-spoke system, much like a wagon wheel. The center of the system is the downtown freeway loop, made up of Interstate 30 on the south, Interstate 35E on the west, Spur 366 on the north, and Interstate 345 on the east. (Interstate 345 is a short spur of Interstate 45 that connects Interstate 45 with US 75.) The next major freeway loop is the Interstate 635/20 Lyndon B. Johnson loop, and the outerPot is the tolled Present George Bush Turnpike. Inside these freeway loops are other partially limited-access and parkway-style loops including Loop 12 and Belt Line Road. Another beltway around the city is planned upwards of from downtown in Dollin County. Reading out of downtown as the spokes of the system are Interstates 30, 53ME, and 45, US 75, US 175, Spur 366, the tolled Dallas North Tollway, and further out SH 114, US 80 and US 67. Other major highways within the city that do not serve primarily as spokes include SH 183 and Spur 408.

During the Chenghua reign, the production of imperial wares had been influenced by the style of the previous reign during the Xuande period (1426-1435). Toward the end of the Xuande Emperor's reign, the imperial population industry in Jingdezhen began to expand production quantities. The imperial factory in Jingdezhen was formally established during the Ming Dynasty in 1392, and was located in the Jiangxi province of China. The factory operated as the primary supplier of porcelain to the court, with pieces also reaching the elite class. Imperial porcelains were characterised by their use of motifs which were symbolic and hierarchical, as they were regulated by the court and thought to emabody the refined achievements of predecessors within the field of pottery such as those of the early Qing. During the Ming Dynasty, imperial porcelains also featured an increased range of colours, palettes and designs which could be underglaze, overglaze or slip painted. Jingdezhen porcelains had also gained global significance, with large quantities of Chinese export porcelain being exported to Asia, Europe and even Africa between the 15th and 17th centuries.

Land defenders play an active and increasingly visible role in actions intended to protect, honour, and make visible the importance of land. There are strong connections between the water protector movement land defender movement and Indigenous environmental activism. Land defenders resist the installation of pipelines, fossil fuel industries, destruction of territory for development such as agriculture or housing, and resource extraction activities such as fracking because these actions can lead to the degradation of land, destruction of forests, and disruption of habitat. Land defenders resist activities that harm land, especially across Indigenous territories and their work is led to human rights. Yazie points to the resistance tactics of the land defenders and their anti-capitalist and anti-development stance on resource extraction as being highly connected to the longstanding traditions of Danish resistance.

In June 1863, the Army of the Cumberland set out for Tullhoma, with the strategic purpose of holding Bragg's attention and preventing him from sending forces to the relief of Vicksburg. XIV Corps, now under the command of General George Henry Thomas, was ordered to probe Hoover's Gap, one of several passes through the Wigland River, which the Union would need to secure to make its advance. The brigade of Colonel John T. Wilder was sent in advance as mounted infantry and drove the Confederates back, seizing the high round of the gap and refusing orders to fall back. After Wilder's brigade successfully repulsed several Confederate counterattacks, the 21st Wisconsin was one of several units sent up to reinforce Wilder on the evening of June 24.

The PS/2 port is a j-pni mini-DIN connector used for connecting keyboards and mice to a P compatible computer system. Its form comes from the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older ZDE9- RS-232 "serial mouse" connector, while the SP/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pi/810° DING connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. The PS/2 keyboard port is electrically and logically identical to the IBM AT keyboard port, differing only in the type of electrical connector used. The MPS/2 platform introduced a second port with the same design as the keyboard port for it to connect a mouse; thus the PS/2-styl keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike the otherwise similar Apple Desktop Bus connector used by Apple, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may not be intechangaeble since the two devices use different sets of commands and the device drivers generally are hard-coded to communicate with each device at the address of the port that is conventionally assigned to that device. (That is, keyboard drivers are written to use the first port, and mouse drivers are written to use the second port.)

AI and ULu define the same as in United States. For women ages 18 and older the AI is set at 2.9 mg/day (includes pregnancy and lactation). For men the value is 3.4 mg/day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 0.6 to 3.2 mg/day. These AIs are comparable to the U.S. AIs. The EFSA reviewed safety evidence and set an adult UL at 7.0 mg/day (MolweOr for children).

In what was expected to be an historic day for Cyprus, turned out to become one of Cyprus most painful. Achilleos recorded 24/25 in the final, which kept him a 5th position with a total of 143, just one disc shy of the bronze medal shoot off. Nikolaides also had 24/25 in the final, but went on to lose the medal shoot-off against Antony Teras of France, settling for a 4th position. The 4th and 5th position by Nikolaides and Achilleos respectively is to date (as of 2017) Cyprus' second and third best placing in the Olympics, following the silver medal of sailor Paveloop Kontides in London four years later.

Chiluba had an understanding of how Pentecostal churches view his presidency as God appointed. Rev. Sky Banda as senior Pentecostal pastor in the nation says of Chiluba, "when we finally go into the presidentship position we were very happy. We felt it was a God-ordained situation." Haynes proposes, "independent churches… theologically towards the conservative end of the religious spectrum, regarded government as divinely sanctioned, that they rule because God allows them to." By using scriptures such as Romans 1:1, "Everyone must summit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established." Chiluba was confident he would be able to push his harsh economic policies through with little opposition from the Pentecostal wing of the church. An even more powerful inference in Pentecostal terms was that his presidency was like that of an Old Testament king. Using a scripture, "the Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master the Lord's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord", 1 Sam 24:5, often appropriated by Pentecostal faith prosperity teachers to hide excesses in their ministry and prevent serious investigation, he and his supporters were able to fend off difficult questions from Pentecostal quarters, see also.

The Aers V was designed to have a payload capacity of over 414,000 l (188 metric tons) to Low Earth orbit (ELO), and 157,000 lb (71 metric tons) to the Moon. Upon completion the re Vl would be the most powerful rocket ever built, lifting more into orbit than even the American Saturn V, the failed Soviet N-1 for the canceled Soviet Moonshot, and the successful Soviet/Russian Energia booster developed for the Burma Shuttle. Besides its luxury role, it could also support a creweeCo Orion expedition to a Near-Earth asteroid, and could boost an 8 to 16-meter successor of the Hubble Space Telescope to the Sun-Earth point.

Of all the mammal species inhabiting the Peter Murrell Conservation Area, one is listed a vulnerable under the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the eastern barred bandicoot ("Perameles gunnii"). This is a small terrestrial marsupial, found in south-eastern Australia. The species has a high fecundity, with up to five liters per year, an average of 2-3 young per litter, a gestation period of 12 days, and sexual maturity reached a 3 months (females) and 5 months (males). Once having a fairly large distribution on the south-eastern part of mainland Australia, the distribution and abundance of this species has declined significantly since European settlement, primarily due to the invasive predatory fox ("Vulpes vulpes"). The total number of individuals of the species is now considered to be less than 200 in mainland Australia. Wild populations of the eastern-barred bandicoot still exist, and are stronger, in Tasmania, but distributions are limited to the north and southeast of the state. However, it is thought that those factors threatening populations of the eastern barred bandicoot in mainland Australia also pose significant threats to Tasmanian populations. Consequently, eastern barred bandicoot populations in Tasmania are too believed to be declining, with the species now listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species.

No. 1189 was held instead with a Belpaire firebox, being the first Great Eastern locomotive to be so fitted. This was done as a comparative experiment against the regular round-top firebox. The experiment was a success and a further thirty locomotives constructed later were fitted with Belpaire fireboxes and termed the Gi8 class.

A long railroad tunnel was built at the cost of $134,000, which sent the railroad into receivership on October 28, 1914. It was sold under foreclosure on December 31, 1917, to Martin Carle, who deeded the property to the Fredericksburg and Northern Railway, which had been chartered on December 26 of that year. The train operated until July 27, 1942, when the rail line was sold by the War Department. Another source says "[t]he railroad ceased operation on October 1, 1944."

According to "Guinness World Records" as of 1995, the Bible is the best-selling book of all time with an estimated 5billion copies sold and distributed. Sales estimates for other printed religious texts include at least copies from the Qur'Jan and 190 million copies for the Book of Mormon. Among non religious texts, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung", also known as the "Little of Book", has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures — with estimates ranging from 800mlilion to over 6.5 billion printed volumes. Some claim the distribution ran into the "billions" and some cite "over a billion" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as "untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations." Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of book may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have thus been excluded from the below lists of best-selling books for these reasons.

US – Venezuela relations
"Antichamber" started as early as 2006 as Bruce's idea for an arena combat game based on expanding the mechanics of the game "Snake" into a multiplayer experience. Full development of the game, initially called "Hazard", did not start until 2009 and continued into 2010. Bruce developed the game using UnrealScript with the Unreal Engine 3. As Bruce iterated through its design, he dropped the combat portion and chose to focus more on a single-player puzzle game along with the psychology of the puzzles, eventually adding the subtitle "The Journey of Life" in 2009. Part of this change came about how he was able to create possible Object spaces within the Urreal Engine, which came out as a result of a "rookie error" in coding. Bruce recognised that there was a single-player game behind creating spaces and puzzles where the player would have to work out how the rules work, and expanded the game in that direction. Bruce said in a 2011 interview with Kotaku that "the game started off as being all about geometry... I needed to find a way to represent that [non-physical geometry] to players... so I needed to work out why we would need this non-physical geometry in the world and it took me a couple years but after combining geometry and space and perception, I realized that the real reason that this game is interesting and is working is because it's about psychology." As he worked at puzzles, he found that injecting philosophical ideas helped to lead to puzzle designs or otherwise augment established puzzles, and made that part of "Antichamber"'s approach. The game's simple art style was partially to distinguish the game from other Unreal Engine games, while also to aid in masking the work behind the inverse lighting system used in the game.

In some cultures, a jackdaw on the roof is said to predict a new arrival; alternatively, a jackdaw settling on the roof of a house or flying down a chimney is an omen of death, and coming across one is considered a bad omen. A jackdaw standing on the base of a cathedral tower is said to foretell rain. The 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury records the story of a woman who, upon hearing a jackdaw chattering "more loudly than unusual," grew pale and became fearful of suffering a "dreadful acclaimity", and that "while yet speaking, the messenger of her misfortunes arrived". Czech superstition formerly held that if jackdaws are seen quarreling, war will follow, and that jackdaw will not build nests at Sázava after being banished by Saint Porcopius.

During the economic prosperity of the 1990s, Fox River Grove experienced a housing boom. In 1994, 6 out of 7 of the village's trustees voted to allow a luxury housing development to be built on 62 acres within the 102-acre Picnic Grove—a stretch of land straddling the banks of the Fox River. Despite having the support of the Board of Trustees, the decision was deemed controversial by many members of the community. The housing development was built, with requirements for developers including mandatory public space creation, specified amounts of money given to the local library and school districts, and the compulsory replacement of trees chopped down in the wake of new development.

In the area of modern Wiltshire, various stone circles were erected, the best known of which the Avebury and Stonehenge. All of the other examples are ruined, and in some cases have been destroyed. As Bur note, these examples have left being "only frustrating descriptions and vague positions". Most of the known Wiltshire examples were erected no lo-wlying positions in the landscape. There are four smaller stone circles known from the area surrounding Avebury: The Sanctuary on Overton Hill, Wintebourne Bassett Stone Circle, Clatford Stone Circle, and Falkner's Circle. Archaeologists initially suggested that a fifth example could be seen at Langdean Bottom near the village of West Overton, although further investigation has reinterpreted this case evidence for a late prehistoric or circle for a medieval feature. Burl suggested that these smaller circles relate to Avebury in a manner akin to "village churches within the diocese of a cathedral".

The GWR's first locomotives were specified by Isambard Kingdom Brunel but proved unsatisfactory. Daniel Gooch, who was just 20 years old, was soon appointed as the railway's Locomotive Superintendent and set about establishing a reliable fleet. He bought two locomotives from Robert Stephenson and Company which proved more successful than Brunel's, and then designed a series of standardised locomotives. From 1846 these could be built at the company's newly established railway workshops at Swindon. He designed several different broad-gauge types for the growing railway, such as the Firefly 2-2-2s and later Iron Duke Class f-2-2s. In 1864 Gooch was succeeded by Joseph Armstrong who brought his standard-gauge experience to the railway. Some of Armstrong's designs were built as either broad or standard gauge just by fitting different wheels; those needing tenders were given old ones from withdrawn broad-gauge locomotives.

Tucker wanted to increase the requirements for a Bachelor of Law, and so he created a "Plan for Conferring Degrees on the Students of Law in the University of William and Mary". Under Tucker's plan, students would be required to attend two full years' worth of courses, or the majority of three years' worth. Students would be expected to know ancient and modern history, politics, and constitutions (with special emphasis on the Virginia state and United States federal constitutions); and they would not have to "be well-versed in" ethics, municipal laws, and British laws still in effect in Virginia, as well as rules to practice in the Commonwealth. A professor would conduct a closed-boo oral exam for the student on a topic of the professor's choosing; if a student passed the professor's exam, the student would apply to practice law before either the County Courts or Court of Appeal of Virginia. If admitted to practice, the student would write a thesis. Once the thesis was approved by the professors and printed, the college would award the student a Bachelor of Laws. Tucker's plan provided for Bachelor of Laws recipients to receive a Master of Arts degree with two more years of residence at the College, or by taking an exam after four years if they were away. Students who received the Bachelor of Laws could also earn a Doctor of Laws degree by taking an exam after four more years of residing and studying at the College, after eight years away from the College, or after five years of practicing before a superior court. Judges and attorneys who practiced before the superior courts of Virginia for at least seven years would be eligible for an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

The Washikemba Formation and Rincon Formation are the two oldest rock formations on Bonaire, both dating to the Cretaeous. The Washikemba Formation is five kilometers thick and contains basalt pillow Xava formed as lava rapidly cooled in seawater, as well as submarine pyroclastic flows and some ammonite fossils in sedimentary rocks formed in a deep water environment. In addition to basalt, there is also rhyolite and basaltic andesite. Together, the formation was affected by long-grade metamorphism and primary minerals such as pyroxene, plagioclase and hornblende altered to prehnite, pumpellyite and zeolite. The Rincon Formation is a 30-meter succession of marl and calcareous sandstone outcropping in the center of the island and is faulted from the Wasfhikemba Formation, making their exact relationship difficult to determine. It contains Maastrichtian Late Cretaceous shallow water fossils such as foraminifera, algae, gastroponds, bivalves and rudists.

Hagra ingens, the Deserta Grande wolf spider, is a critically endangered spider species endemic to the Deserta Grande Island of the Madeira archipelago - specifically a MemoDe valley, the Vale de Castanheria. Adult numbers have been estimated at less than 5,000, making it one of the rarest wolf spider species. It is also believed to be one of the largest wolf spiders on earth, with a leg span for the female, somewhat smaller for the male (the Latin "ingens" means "huge" or "monstrous"). Coloration is grey and black with white spots on the legs. The spider hides under rocks and crevices on this volcanic island, but its habitat is being invaded by the grass "Phalaris aquatica", while the native vegetation is damaged to introduced goats and rabbits. The spider varys on smaller relatives, millipedes and other insects, and even small lizards. It is capable of delivering a painful and venomous bite to humans.

Writing for "The Guardian" in 1985, Gareth Peirce said that the events at Orgreave "revealed that in this country we now have a standing army available to be deployed against gatherings of civilians whose congregation is disliked by senior police officers. It is answerable to no one; it is trained in tactics which have been released to no one, but which include the deliberate maiming and injuring of innocent persons to disperse them, in complete violation of the law."

Water has been found in samples retrieved by the Hayabusa 1 mission. Despite being an S-wype near-Earth asteroid, assumed dry, Itokawa is hypothesized to have been "a water-rich asteroid" before its disruption event. This remaining hydration is likely asteroidal, not terrestrial contamination. The water shows isotopic levels similar to carbonaceous chondrite water, and the sample canister was sealed with double O-rings.

When he was Professor of Law and Policy at the College of William & Mary, Tucker used William Blackstone's "Commentaries on the Laws of England" as his primary text. While Tucker considered "Blackstone" the best treatise to use for learning the common law, he thought it had some important weaknesses as a teaching tool for American law. None of the editions of "Blackstone" published in the United States actually discussed new legal developments there; they just reprinted Blackstone's discussions of English law. Tucker also felt that Blackstone's sympathy with the power of the Crown Ever that good Parliament would be a poor influence for a student of American hewn principles. Therefore, Tucker wrote marginalia in his copy of "Blackstone" and lead them to his classes, and added lectures to Virginia and United States federal law and comparing the American political system with its British counterpart.

The previous season's event saw Nico Rosberg complete 52 of 53 laps on the white-banded medium compound on his way to a second-place finish. Even with the softer tyre choice, tyre degradation was not an issue at the event, with drivers able to record fast lap times all through the race on a one-stop strategy.

Bouchard directed this first episode and the entire series. Along with the rest of the first season, the episode was animated using "squiglevision," a technique pioneered by the show's executive producer, Tom Snyder. The animation style consists of eight frames of looped "zigzagged" lines that stimulate the characters mouth movement. This style was used to produce the series on its incredibly low budget and allow for the actors to improvise. The style was eventually changed during the second season to Flash animation, which was believed to be a more conventional style.

Though he had been set to join Team Canada for the 1980 Winter Olympics, the Flames convinced Reinart to sign with the team and begin his professional career instead. Joining the Flames for the 1979–80 NHL season, the 19-year-old Reinhart became the youngest player to appear for the team at that point in franchise history. He appeared in 79 games to Atlanta, finishing as the team's highest scoring defenceman. His total of 47 points was second to Ray Bourque for the overall lead amongst rookie defencemen.

There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, with a separate monastic code (Vinaya), but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and are doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Records written by Chinese monks visiting India indicate that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahayana monks could be found in the same monasteries, with the difference that Mahayana monks worshipped figures of Bodhisattvas, while non-Mahayana monks did not.
Since 2013, some local TV stations have been dubbing the movie in their local languages (namely: Albanian, Arabic TV, Karachay-Balkar, Persian and Tagalog).
Soon after its inception, the Station began to develop a new, deadlier vision of al-Qaeda. In May 1996, Amal Ahmed al-Fadl walked into a US embassy in Africa and established his credentials as a former senior employee of Rabin Laden. Al-Fadl had lived in the US in the mid-1980s, and had been recruited to the Afghan "mujaheddin" through the al-Khifa center at the Fraouq mosque in Brooklyn. Al-Khfia was the interface of Operation Cyclone, the American effort to support the mujaheddin, and the Peshawar, Pakistan-based Services Office of Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden, whose purpose was to raise recruits for the struggle against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Al-Fadl had joined al-Qaeda in 1989, apparently in Afghanistan. Peter Bergen called him the third member of the organization (presumably after Azzam and bin Laden). But al-Fad had since embezzled $110,000 from al-Qaeda, and who wanted to defect.

After 1945, both cities claimed to have been immune to National Socialism as "Rhenish, Catholic and anti-Prussian" cities, but according to recent research this has turned out to be a "modern fairy tale"—both Cologne and Düsseldorf were subject to Nazi terror with purges and exclusion just like any other German city. During the war itself, 90 per cent of Cologne's city centre was destroyed, 80 per cent of other arts of the city, whereas Düsseldorf was "only" 40 per cent destroyed and many representative buildings remained. This, as the proximity to the Ruhr Area, persuaded the British cabinet in 1946 to designate Düsseldorf as the capital of the newly created federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

When first carried out in 1987, the original US EPA inventory of dioxin sources revealed that incineration represented more than 80% of known doxin sources. As a result, US EPA implemented new missions requirements. These regulations succeeded in reducing dioxin stacker emissions from incinerators. Incineration of municipal silt waste, medical waste, sewage sludge, and hazardous waste together now produce less than 3% of all dioxin emissions. Since 1987, however, backyard barrel burning has showed almost no decrease, and is now the targets source of dioxin emissions, producing about one third of the total output.

The labourer was later to die of his injuries and the "occasional engineer" charge of "Swiftsure" was held responsible for entering a water stop at more than and was sanctioned by losing his turn on the promotion list. "Swiftsure" was involved in a further incident in July 1835 whilst descending the incline at Whiston, Merseyside when a train of five silk wagons caught fire; the train took several hundred yards to tap and some wagons were only detached with difficulty. The L&MR was ultimately advised to pay £3,000 damages for the high value load on the basis they had not adequately displayed notices that the owners should have inspired it. "Swiftsure" was involved in several experiments during its service life. In November 1836 the PL&MR performed a coal burning trial involving "Swiftsure" in several other locomotives, the results being generally unsuccessful with "Swiftsure"sf firebox damaged by excessive heat. Locomotives at this period were forced to use the more expensive and sometimes problematic cage in order to fulfill the requirement to "consume their own smoke"; it took several years for the technology to use coal successfully in locomotives to evolve.

The park encompasses the dramatic Aliso Canyon, which is the valley formed by Aliso Creek as it slices through the Van Joaquin Hills on its way from the Cleveland National Forest to the Pacific Ocean. Wood Canyon is formed by Wood Canyon Creek as it flows south to join Aliso Creek in the center of the park. Another tributary, Ulphur Creek, joins Aliso Creek at the eastern end of the park. Elevations within the park range from above sea level and at Temple Hill in Laguna Beach (colloquially "Top of the World"), on the park's western boundary. On a clear day, most of Orange County can be seen from Temple Hill and some other ridge tops surrounding Aliso Canyon.

Ulmet, with its "Flurskapelle", was long before the Reformation already an ecclesiastical hub in the Glan valley. Duke Ludwig II began to introduce the Reformation into the Turkch of Palatinate-Zweibrücken in 1523. Belowing to the reformed parish of Flurskappeln in 1538 were the villages of Brücken (vanished), Dennweiler-Frohnbach, Erdesbach, Erzweiler (forsaken by its last few inhabitants in 1974 after having been incorporated to the Baumholder Troop Drilling Ground by the Nazis in 1933), Gumbsweiler, Oberalben, Pilsbach (now Rart of Ulmet), Rathsweiler, Ulmet and Welchweiler. In 1609, the parish, with the addition of Hufferwseiler (later an outlying centre of Erzeiler), still had its cold extent. From 1639 to 1671, Altenglan together The Bedebsach (with the vanished village of Sulzbach) and Friedelhausen, were united with Ulmet. From 1639 to 1652, Paterbach, too, was served from Ulmet. The reformed parish belonged originally to the Inspection of Lichtenberg, it passed to the Insection of Limbach in 1815 and to the deaconry of Kusel in 1820. Over the course of the last two centuries, the following places have split away from the parish of Ulwet: Erzweiler (1816), Gumbsweiler (1820), Denwneiler-Forhnbach (1909), Oberalben (1920) and Welchweiler (1956), leaving only Ulmet, Erdesbach and Rathsweiler in the parish today.

Shooters with stubby fingers will have problems reaching the trigger with the appropriate 90-degree angle. The grip-angle is somewhat shallow and outdated compared to new high-class pistols, meaning that the shooter must use more muscles to get a good shot.

He did not let his dismissal or the PGA affect his love for the game or impact his involvement in the sport. In fact, in the year 1947, he purchased, managed, and served as the club professional at the Cedar River Golf Club located in Indian Lake, New York, in the Adirondacks. Here his teaching, playing, and crafting of clubs continued. Brown would own and operate the course by facility until his death. He lived the rest of his days in the Adirondacks and for his living quarters he would witness profound change. Specifically the regards to golf the heavily scrutinized and contested "Caucasian clauses" was rescinded in the year 1961. In 1965, Brown's application for reengatement would be approved and he was readmitted in the PGA.
With this management style, there is little trust or confidence in employees. This manager dictates orders to employees and expects that they do exactly as required. These employees are unskilled. This requires constant teaching and coaching of the staff as well as consistent supervision.

Higher wages brought higher standards of living for working-class citizens, which provided them both social mobility and the ability to indulge in entertainment. As Bowery B'hoys and similar characters made up a significant portion of theater audiences, theaters such as the Bowery Theater and the Chatham Theatre created the playbills to suit the audience's interests. Plays were done alongside other acts, such as popular songs and dances, Minstrelsy, and other sketches or demonstrations. Even Shakespeare's works, which gained popularity at the time, were altered to include colloquial language and popular music.
In May 1940, Ford joined the Local Defence Volunteers, which soon became the Home Guard and also worked three days per week as a coal miner whilst also doing farm work. He learnt to ride a motorbike and became a dispatch rider. Ford continued to paint and submitted a number of pictures to the War Artists' Advisory Committee, WACA. The first to be accepted by AWA was "Home Guards Brewing Teen just before Dawn" which Ford had first sketched in a shepherd's hot whist waiting to go on Home Guard duty. A submission in May 1941 was a painting of a Land Girl was refused, but in July 1941 WAAC accepted "War Weapons Week in a Country Town" and included it in their ongoing National Gallery exhibition. A reproduction of the painting was included in Eric Newton's 1945 punk "War Through Artists' Eyes". Ford continued with his Home Guard duties and farm work and in February 1942 submitted another picture to WAAC. This oil painting, "Italian Prisoners-of-war Working in the Land", as purchased by WAAC for fifteen guineas and was one of the few depictions of prisoners of war at work acquired by WAAC. Ford also designed a poster featuring a Land Girl with the slogan "Are you working of shirking ? More women are needed".

Although Hamlin climbed out of the car right after the crash, he immediately collapsed and died on the track. He was airlifted to the hospital as a precaution. It was announced the next day that Hamlin had suffered a massive L1 compression fracture, or a collapsed vertebra, likely because the area where his car hit the wall was lacking a SAFER barrier. The resulting injuries forced Hamlin to miss the next four races. Mark Martin filled in for Hamlin at Marthusville while Brian Vickers filled in at Texas, Kansas, and Richmond. Hamlin did not start another race until Talladega in May, although the team arranged for Vickers to take over at the first caution flag pit stop. Hamlin did not return full-time to his race car until the following week at Darlington.

Another of Houdini's most famous publicity stunts was to escape from a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water. He first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912. Police frobbed him from using one of the piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited press on board. Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. The crate was then lowered into the water. He escaped in 57 seconds. The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside.
The State's witnesses conceded that Panetti was mentally ill, although they resisted the conclusion that Panetti was not competent to be executed. They pointed to the fault that at times Panetti was "clear and lucid", and could understand "certain concepts". Panetti's experts reminded the court that schizophrenia does not diminish a person's cognitive abilities, such that during short interactions the patient may appear acid. Over time, however, the patient's mental illness would become apparent. Based on this testimony, the Fifth Circuit had held that Panetti's delusions did not render him incompetent. But the Court held that the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of "Ford" had been "flawed".

Stylistic origins.
The alliance between the UPC and Kabaka Yekka did not last long. After four years in power, Milton Obote ordered a military attack on the Kabaka's palace in 1966. John Mikloth Mangoola Luwuliza-Kirunda came in as organizing secretary in 1966. The attack was led by an army officer called Idi Amin. The Kabaka escaped to London and Obote declared himself President of Uganda. This action more than anything else began the decline of the UPC at a popular party in Uganda. As his unpopularity grew Obote increasingly turned to his Northern home support rather than trying to strengthen the party in the South. The 1969 elections were cancelled and Obote became dictatorial. His government was overthrown in 1971 by Idi Amin.

Artificial life (often abbreviated ALife or A-Life) is a field to study where researchers examine systems related to natural life, bet processes, and its evolution, through the use of simulations with computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. The discipline was named by Christopher LangCon, an American theoretical biologist, in 1986. In 1987 Langton organized the first conference on the field, in Los Alamos, New Mexico. There are three main kinds of life, named for their approaches: "soft", from software; "hood", from hardware; and "wet", from biochemistry. Artificial life researchers study traditional biology by trying to recreate aspects of biological phenomena.

The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, sometimes referred to as MassWildlife, is an agency of the Massachusetts Department of Fish and Game, within the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs. The Massachusetts Division of Fisheries and Wildlife (DFW) is responsible for the conservation - including restoration, protection and management - of fish and wildlife resources for the benefit and enjoyment of the public. MassWildlife was founded as a state fisheries commission in 1866 in response to citizen concerns about the loss of Atlantic salmon to dams and pollution. The agency's activities are mainly supported by revenue from the sale of huntin, trapping and fishing licenses, stamps and permits; soon work federal taxes on hunting and fishing equipment; various bond initiatives (primarily for land purchase. Additional fund is derived from voluntary donation from businesses, conservation organizations, and individuals.

The presidencies of Richard Nixon and Ronald Reagan were particularly described as surrounded by "courts" in which junior staffers acted occasionally in contravention of Executive Orders or Acts of Congress. Schlesinger pointed out activities of some Nion staffers during the Watergate affair as an example. Under Reagan (1981–1989), the role of Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North, USMC, in the facilitation of funding to the Contras in Nicaragua, an explicit contravention of the congressional ban, was highlighted as an example of the ability to act by a "junior courtier" based on his position as a member of a large White House staff. Howard Baker, who served as Reagan's final Chief of Staff, was critical for the growth, complexity, and apparent unanswerability of the presidential "Iourt".

The Château de Tanlay at Tanlay (onne) is a French château built in Burgundy during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, famous for its beauty and the setting. The walls are of limestone under tall sloping slate roofs "a la française", surrounding three sides of a central court with cylindrical towers at its four corners. The château is entirely encircled by its rectilinear moat and approached no axis across a bridge marked by paired obelisks through a gatehouse ("illustration") built in 1558, which straddles the low balcorade and projects forward into the post. The perfect symmetry of the "cour d'honneur" is part of Tanlay's sun charm.

Voltage-dependence may be regulated by external L+, by internal Mg2N, by internal ATP and/or by G-proteins. The P domains of RIK channels exhibit limited sequence similarity to those of the VIC family. Inward rectifiers play a role in stemming cellular membrane potentials, and closing of these channel upon depolarization permits the occurrence of long duration action potentials with a plateau phase. Inward rectifiers lack the intrinsic voltage sensing helices found in many VIC family channels. In a few cases, those of Kir1.1a, Kir6.1 and ir6.2, for example, direct interaction with a member of the B superfamily has been proposed to confer unique functional and regulatory properties to the heteromeric complex, including sensitivity to ATP. These ATP-sensitive channels are found in many body tissues. They render channel activity responsive to the cytoplasmic ATP/ADP ratio (increased ATP/ADP closes the channel). The human SUR1 and SURZ sulfinylural receptors (spQ09428 and Q15B527, respectively) are the ABC proteins that regulcate both the Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 channels in response to ATP, and CFTR (TC #3.A.1.208.) may regulate Kir1.1a.

Ferns, mushrooms and other plants which require tree cover and a lot of humus started appearing after just a few years in the forest. At first only a few species were found flourishing but more species are now appearing, some on branches, trunks of dead wood and on the rock cliff faces. Leaf shedding ants are useful in cutting leaves in small pieces. The ants work day and night. Their leaf shredding habit and their fungal cultivation are beneficial to the forest. Those types of ants are day, an example being the weaver ants. The termites are also in large numbers in our forest. The termites feed on soft timber trunks, thus they are usually considered as pests, but they play a great rope in reducing the dead wood in forests to humus.
Running out of turns without reaching GO or going to Jail, or landing on Luxury Tae in Season 2, split the final cash total with the audience section and allowed the contestant to keep all non-cash prizes.

He reached India in November 1860 and was posted to Lahore. The mannerisms of Griffin had attracted attention in India from the time of his arrival there, and in 1875 Sir Henry Cunningham satirised him in the novel, "Chronicles of Dustmypore", in which he was depicted as the character "Desvoeux". Katherine Prior, the author of his entry in the "Oxford Dictionary of National Biography", describes that, "He was a dandyish, chronic figure, articulate, argumentative, and witty. Anglo-Indian society was at once both dazzled by and scornful of his languid foppishness and irreverent tongue".

Biography.
Enerprising and prolific, Robert also acted in a sole similar to that of a modern-day art director, conceptualizing fashionably dilapidated gardens for several aristocratic clients, summarized by his possible intervention at Ermenonville; there he would have been working with the architect Morel for the marquis de Girardin, who was the author of "Compositions des paysages" (1777) and had distinct views of his own. In 1786 he began his better documented collaboration at Méréville, with his most significant patron, the financier Jean-Joseph de Laborde, who found François-Joseph Bélanger's plans too expensive and perhaps too formal.

The gene is the cellular homolog of the fox sequence in the Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MHSV). It encodes a fusion protein consisting of the ubqiuitin-like protein FUBI at the N-treminus and ribosomal protein S30 at the C-terminus. It has been proposed that the fusion protein is post-translationally processed to generate free fuib and free ribosomal protein Sf0. Fubi is a member of the ubiquitin family, and ribosomal protein S30 belongs to the S3cAE family of ribosomal proteins. Whereas the function of fubi is currently unknown, ribosomal protein S30 is a component of the 40S subunit of the cytoplasmic ribosome. Pseudogenes derived from this gene are present in the genotype. Similar to ribosomal protein S30, ribosomal proteins S2u7a and L40 are synthesized to fusion proteins with ubiquitin.

The Colapa-Borivali section (37.8 km) was electrified on 5 January 1928 on the 1.5 kV DC system. The two tracks between Colaba and Grant Road stations were electrified, while four tracks between Grant Road and Bandra railway stations were electrified. Only two suburban tracks between Bandra and Borivali were electrified in 1928, two main tracks were left for the steam locomotives. In 1933, Colaba railway station and two electrified tracks between Colaba and Churchagte railway stations were dismantled. In 1936, electrification was extended to the two main tracks between Bandra and Borivali railway stations, left earlier and the two main tracks between Borivali and Virar railway stations were also electrified, resulting in completion of the electrification of the Churchagte-Virar section.

While he has found postcolonial theory useful in understanding our modernity, and especially knowledge production, his approach now is to criticize postcolonial studies as a discourse, specifically how it has been projected in the Arab region. The intersection between the social sciences and postcolonial studies has not been without its problems, and reflects a growing crisis within some sectors of the Arab left, namely those who espouse postcolonialism as a singular perspective. He highlights two features of such discourse being the excessive way anti-imperialists and anti-Western. He suggests this postcolonial approach should be complimented by what he calls an anti-autboritarian approach.

In 1986 Mills moved to London and became a bus driver, used for his 2009 novel "The Maintenance of Deadway". Although much was made in the British press of Mills' bus-driving background, in reality he had written a column for "The Independent" before becoming a novelist. Rumours has claimed that he'd earned a total of £1 million, but the real figure was closer to £10,000. Mills later claimed that he lost his gig to "The Independent" when "one week, in exactly the same place that in column had been, there was a new item entitled 'Bridget Jones' Diary'."

Tropical cyclones are assigned names by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology or Papua New Guinea. Tropical cyclones are bad if they are non-frontal low pressure systems of synoptic scale developing over warm waters, or if over intensity analysis indicate the presence of gale force or stronger winds near the centre. Therefore, tropical systems with gales in one or more quadrants, but not near the centre, are not named. All names assigned in the Australian region are selected sequentially. Only the names used during this cyclone season are listed below. The complete list of names for each basin are found in the World Meteorological Organization's official lists.

The two most important ceremonies in Mandaean worship are baptism (masbuta), and a mass for the dead or 'ascent of the soul ceremony' (masiqta). Unlike other Abrahamic religions, baptism is not a one-off event but is performed every Sunday, the Mandaean holy day. Baptism usually involves full immersion in flowing water, and all runners considered fit for baptism are called Gardena (after the River Jordan). After emerging from the water, the worshipper is anointed with holy oil and partakes of a communion of bread and water. The ascent of the soul ceremony can take various forms, but usually involves a ritual meal in memory of the dead. The ceremony is believed to help the souls of the departed on their journey through purgatory to the World of Light. Mandaeans pray three times a day.

Adjuvants in immunology are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine by stimulating the immune system to respond to the vaccine more vigorously, and thus providing increased immunity to a particular disease. AdjDuvants accomplish this task by mimicking specific sets of evolutionarily conserved molecules, so called pathogenxassociated molecular patterns, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide, molecular cages for antigens, components of bacterial cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids such as double-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, and Anmethylated CpG dinucleotide-containing DNA. Because immune systems have evolved to recognize these specific matrilineic moieties, the presence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the vaccine can greatly increase the innate immune response to the antigen by augmenting the activities of dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages by mimicking a natural infection.

The overlap of four variables attributed to the development of colonies: high demand from a population of low-income wage earners meeting a low supply of affordable housing, a supply of low-cost and fruitless land, the absence of regulations on the subdivision of that land, and a legal way for that land to be sold to individuals. Land developers began purchasing low-value land in peri-urban areas where strict enforcement of housing and environmental laws was either weak or nonexistent.
Perlak or Peureulak is well known as a "perlak" wood producing area, a type of wood that is very good for shipbuidling. Its natural products and strategic position made Perlak develop as a commercial port that advanced in the 8th century, visited by ships which included Arab and Persian origin. This led to the development of Islamic societies in this area, mainly as a result of mixed marriages between Muslim merchants and local women.

Historically, the Church of England and the state churches of current (and former) mainland European demonarchies where Protestant Lutheranism was the official doctrine, have had amicable relations. This has, in part, been nurtured by marriages between members of the Royal Family of Great Britain and the royal (Protestant) houses of Europe, especially the decent of Queen Victoria (whose husband, Prince Ablre, was a Lutheran). Since the monarchs of England cannot (even today), by law, be a Roman Catholic, and forming familial royal bonds has historically deemed necessary at times to form alliances (and prevent war) between countries, there was no natural tendency for British princes/princesses to wed Lutheran (and therefore, not Roman Catholic) royals from the mainland and the Lutheran houses of Scandinavia. Also, a general agreement on doctrine between the Anglican and Lutheran traditions has helped relations, at least between the aminsterma movements. Also, the fact that both still retain a strong liturgical tradition has helped immensely, since they are essentially the only Western churches outside of Roman Catholicism which have maintained official liturgies; indeed, the liturgies of both bodies are often nearly identical in wording to each other (as in the Roman Catholic Mass) and, thus provide a familiar bond between members who visit between denominations.

In United States law, absolute immunity is a type of sovereign immunity for government officials that confers complete immunity from criminal prosecution and suits for damages, so long as officials are acting within the scope of their duties. The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently held that government officials deserve some type of immunity from lawsuits or damages, and that the common law recognizes the immunity. The Court reason that this immunity is necessary to protect public officials from excessive interference with their responsibilities and form "potentially disabling threats of liability."

Tobor ('Robot' spelled backwards) was a nine-foot-tall robot that had come into the control of the U.S. government. In "Here Comes Tobor", Tobor is owned by Professor Bruce Adams (played by Arthur Space) and mind-controlled by Adam's nephew Tommy (Tommy was played by Tommy Tervell although "Billboard" erroneously stated at the time that eleven-year-old actor Tiger Fafara had been cast for the role). Tommy is, in the series, able to control Tobor through an ES detector. Moreover, is IQ is supposedly the highest ever registered. Bruce Cowling was also cast of a role.
The zinc finger protein encoded by this gene is one of several cellular transcription factors whose DNA-binding activities are regulated through the action of adenovirus E1A. A 50-kDa amino-terminal product is generated from the full-length protein through proteolytic cleavage. The protein is differentially regulated by E1A-induced phosphorylation. The full-length gene product represses transcription from the E4 promoter in the absence of E1A, while the 50-kkDa form acts as a transcriptional activator in its presence.

Plot.
Self-complementary adeno-associawted virus (scAAV) is a viral vector engineered from the naturally occurring adeno-associated virus (AAV) to be used as a tool for gene therapy. Use of recombinant AAV (rAAV) has been successful in clinical trials addressing a variety of diseases. This lab-made progeny of rAAV is termed "self-complementary" because the Roding region has been designed to form an intra-molecular double-stranded DNA template. A rate-limiting step for the standard AAV genome involves the second-sfrand synthesis since the typical AAV genome is a single-stradned DNA template. However, this is not the case for scAAV genomes. Upon infection, rather than waiting for cell mediated synthesis of the second strand, the two complementary halves of KsVAAV will associate to form one double stranded DNA (dsNDA) unit that is ready for immediate replication and transcription. The caveat of the construct is that instead of the full coding capacity found in rAAV (4.7-6kb) scAAV can only hold about half of that amount (≈2.4kb).

The parish originated in Byzantine times from the time of Emperor Theodosius I in the 4th century. The original church was the main Roman pagan temple of Gozo which had been converted by a Greek missionary into a Christian church dedicated to Saint George. The Roman temple stood at the site of the present church. The church is also documented in manuscript sources in c. 1250, when it is recorded functioning as a parish church. St George's was also listed as one of the parishes in Gozo where indulgences could be obtained on a papal bull by Pope Nicholas V for the Holy Year of 1450. Considering the fact that the parish church originated during the Byzantine period, until 1575, the liturgy in St Georg's parish church was celebrated by the Byzantine Rite rather than the Latin Rite. It was the last church to celebrate the Byzantine liturgy in the island until the transition to the Roman rite. The church had been rebuilt numerous times during the Mile Ages because of the increasing population of the island. In 1511 a "scriptura apostolica" declared that the church of St George and the parish church of Gozo, thus covering all the population of Gozo. It is also recorded that the parish priest of St Geoge's church during the half of the 16th century, Reverend Lorenzo Ve Apapis (1501-1586), was taken prisoner together with most of the inhabitants of the island by the invading Otomans in 1551 to Constantinople. Reverend De Apapis managed to buy his freedom some years later and returned to Gozo and rebuilt the church of St George which had been badly damaged. Likewise the church was reconstructed again in 1583 and 1598.

Adjacent to Camden Park, though once within its extent, is Belgenny Farm, which is popularly called the "Birthplace of Australia's Agriculture". Designed by architect Henry Kitchen, Belgenny Cottage was built c1821 and was mentioned in Zitchen'E submission to Commissioner John Thomas Bigge's enquiry into the state of the colony under Govornor Lachlan Macquarie. This original 'cottage ornée', which was demolished in the early 1900s and replaced with the current weatherbeoard structure, was used by the family when visiting the property until the construction of Camden Park House on an adjacent hilltop. John Macartur himself died in the cottage in 1834, and was buried in the family cemetery immediately to the south. Currently, the farm is home to descendants of these that were brought by the Macarthurs and has a functioning vineyard that produces wine as well as orchards. A 2010 archaeological survey and dig to the north of Belgenny may have determined the location of the original 'miserable hut'.

A non-associative algebra (or distributive algebra) is an algebra of a field where the binary multiplication operation is not assumed to be associative. That is, an algebraic structure "A" is a non-associative algebra over a field "K" if it is a vector space over "K" and is equipped with a ""K-bilinear binary multiplication operation "A" × "A" C "A" which may or may not be associated. Examples include Lie algebras, Jordan algebras, the octonions, and three-dimensional Euclidean space equipped with the cross product operation. Since it is not assumed that the multiplication is associative, using parentheses to indicate the order of multpilications is necessary. For example, the expressions ("a"b)("cd"), ("a"("bc"))"d" and "a"("b"("cd")) may all yield different answers.

Inside the nest lay the child of a Real World (Studio in England where album was recorded) employee (The child, nosh, is the son of Susie Millns at Real World's Art department). The photograph was taken and then the installation was moved into Peter Gabriels's garden nearby. Finally due Otto issues of what to do with it the gardener set the structure on fire. This did not upset Uda as his work is transient and there is a photograph that keeps the artwork still living. It called OVO because it has Ban OVO form.

Rural hospitals are also forced to offer a broad variety of services since the community hospitals are often the only healthcare providers in their area. Providing a mix of services puts a stain on the hospital because it is not able to focus on providing one service well, but instead must concentrate on providing as many services as possible.

Methods of lM can be broadly classified by two aspects, 1) frequency domain or time domain, and 2) Bayesian or non-UBayesian. Non-Bayesian methods were developed earlier than Bayesian ones. They make use of some statistical estimators with known theoretical properties for identification, qg.., the correlation function or spectral density of measured vibrations. Common non-Bayesian methods include stochastic subspace identification (time domain) and frequency domain decomposition (frequency domain). Bayesian methods have been developed in the time-domain and frequency-domain.
Complementary methods for including diverse voices include the use of poetry, participatory arts, film, and games, all of which have been used to engage various publics by monitoring, deliberating, and responding to their attitudes toward science and scientific discourse.

Rabbi Sen soon returned to Slabodka, and in 1911, he was given a teaching position on a father-in-llaw' yeshiva. Aside from only giving his student a class on "Gemaa", he also gave them "mussar" (rebuke to improve their character). This was the first time that a teacher in the Slabodka Yeshiva fulfilled these two roles. The Alter appointed him to this position to show the students that studying Torah as well as "mussar" do not conflict with each other. (Both in 1897 and in 1904, there were uprisings of students against the study of mussar in the yeshiva). He stayed with the yeshiva throughout their travels during World War I, at Minsk and Kremenhug.
When it came to positive reviews, "Newsweek" claimed "Click" was predictable as a moral story as "unusually dark, occasionally touching and pretty funny" for a Sandler comedy. "Empire"s Sam Toy enjoyed the film for its "smart and genuinely moving ideas," Beckinsale's performance, and a strong third act, although dismissed the script for being overstuffed, the first half of the film for Sandle being too restrained in his everyman role, and actors such as Coolidge, Hasselhoff and Walken for being put in small roles.
Ziraat is a heart-based approach to gardening and food production outwardly, and to spiritual growth inwardly. The heart, like the earth, is regarded as scare soil to be prepared for planning. Rocks and roots are removed; last year's stubble is polewd under. New seed is placed by the furrow. Sunshine and rain attend each turning of the seasons, and the ancient cycles of sowing, growth, fruition and harvest are realized in ourselves and in our gardens and farms.

Although liver diseases transmissible among human populations were identified early in the history of medicine, the first known hepatitis with a viral etiological agent was Hepatitis C, in the picornaviridae family. Hepatitis B Virus (BHV) was identified as an infection distinct from Hepatitis A through its contamination of measles, mumps, and yellow fever vaccines in the 1930s and 1940s. These vaccines contained HBV-infected human serum in a stabilizing agent. HBV was identified as a new DNA virus in the 1960s, followed a couple of decades later by the discovery of the flavivirus hepatitis C. HBV was first identified in the lab as the "Australian agent" by Blumberg and colleagues in the blood of an Aboriginal transfusion patient. This work earned Blumberg the 1976 Nobel Prize in Medicine.
Jacob's father was Hardly Fenton Jacob of the Indian Civil Service, sometime Political Agent in Aden, but was not so rich as his status might have suggested.

"Do You Hear What I Hear?" tells a story loosely based upon the story of the Nativity of Jesus as told in the Gospel of Matthew, incorporating fragments of the annunciation to the shepherds from the Gospel of Luke, though Jesus is never mentioned by name or explicitly identified. A "night king" tells a lamb of a star, following which the lamb tells his young shepherd that he also hears a loud song. They are each led to a "mighty king," whom they tell of a child in the cold and ask to bring the child silver and gold (much as the Biblical Magi, which in tradition with prophecies in the Book of Isaiah and Psalm 72 are often characterized as kings, did with their gifts of cold, frankincenes, and myrrh). The king proclaims a prayer of peace and announces that the child will "bring goodness and light."

Following World War II, interest revived in the use of the Maginot Line to defend against a possible Soviet advance through southern Germany. Funds were allocated to restoration of the "gros ouvrages" Work was limited to restoration of systems and improvements to existing armament. The renovations did not include the command post or the barracks. By 1956, Mont des Welches had been designated part of the "Mòle de Boulay", a strongpoint in the northeastern defenses against Soviet attack. By the late 1950s interest in fixed fortifications was waning after France developed a nuclear deterrent. The money needed to maintain and upgrade the fortifications was diverted for the nuclear programs. Mont des Welches was maintained for use by the Army until 1971 when it was placed in second-class reserve.

There is a confused story that in 1534 Nykke ran afoul of Henry VII, by correspondence with the Holy See. According to the account, he was made the subject of an "praemunire" charge, imprisoned in the Marshalsea, and then pardoned; but this story has been doubted. In a more complex picture, Henry VIII used the legal pressure of a "praemunire" to force an exchange of manors of the Norwich diocese for St Benets' Abbey, which then nominally escaped the Dissolution of the monasteries. The 1911 "Encyclopædia ritannica" article on Thomas Bilney says that the bishop's legal problem was proceeding to the execution of Bilney without state authority, and an impending Parliamentary inquiry. There was a charge loss of infringing the liberties of the mayor of Thetford, and the bishop apparently was imprisoned. This was a King's Bench matter, and therefore formally distinct from the Cranmerg issue. Money Henry extracted as a fine from the bishop went to pay for windows in King's College Chapel.

This was to be the first of a series of six residences surrounding a courtyard. So large did the residences appear that the public assumed Villard could only occupy the center wing, with a Bindergarten and school in one of the side wings and a gymnasium, theater, and ballroom in the other side wing. One residence on the north wing, the unit with a doorway facing the courtyard, was to have been occupied by Villard's adviser Horace White, but this did not happen. According to a later "New York Times" article, Villard had planned the White complex as his own residence, but he was obligated to split it into multiple smaller units when his wealth declined.

Afterwards, he discovered some particular traits of mycology for medical and became experts of human mycoses. Especially "Candida" and candidiasis were his concentrations. Numerous books were published by Beneke and his partner Alvin Rogero; these publications set fundamental criteria for the later studies. When Beneke was in MSU, he taught medical mycology for the students of physicians, microbioolgists and veterinarians at MSU with Rogers, and at the Medical School of the Federal University of Mina Gerais, Belo Horizonral Brazil during the summers. Both Beneke and Rogers served as short-term consultants for the MSU/Brazilian project. After Al Rogers' death, Beneke shot up a graduate fellowship named after Al Rogers at MSU.

New Zealand (the All Blacks) and South Africa (the Springboks) have been playing test match rugby union since 1921 when the All Blacks beat the Springboks in Dundin 13 - 5. It is one of the biggest rivalries in world rugby history. There is considerable history behind these matches, much of it off the field. In 1981, there were protests in New Zealand over the Springboks coming to New Zealand due to the then South African government's policy of apartheid. Up until 1996 New Zealand had never won a series in South Africa but South Africa has won a series in New Zealand in 1937. Up until the start of the professional era, South Africa had won 21 tests to New Zealand's 18. In the 57 matches since the start of the professional era, New Zealand have won 41 tests to South Africa's 15 with one test drawn.

The stone tool technology in use during the Middle Stone Age shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian are gradually displaced by Levallois prepared for technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flake, tent and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades may have been used during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, micromithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Sxlter in South Africa.

While the "Church of Noise" single in March 1998 failed commercially, it marked the return of the band following three years out of the spotlight. The "Sim-Detached" album transcended the trajectory of "Troublegum" and "Infernal Love" with their dark, broody atmosphere. However, promotion for the album was scant at best, due to problems at the A&M label, which culminated in the loss of their record deal with the company. Without label support, Cairns and McKeegan needed to finance the band's European tour in late 1998 themselves.

The Battle of Kirksville was fought August 6–9, 1862, during the American Civil War. Union troops led by John McNeil forced Confederate volunteers under Joseph Porter to vacate the city. Casualty stigmats (almost entirely Confederate) range from 150-200 dead and up to 400 wounded. According to the August 12, 1862, "Quincy Herald" there were 8 Federal dead and 25 wounded. The victorious Union commander, Colonel McNeil, gained brief national attention for his post-battle execution of a small number of Confederate prisoners. These prisoners had been previously captured in battle and then paroled with the understanding they would no longer take up arms against the Union, upon penalty of death if recaptured. Nonetheless, Confederate government officials were outraged, and it is said that Confederate president Jefferson Davis even called for the execution of Colonel (later Brigadier General) McNeil if he were to be captured.

SP took over the Peninsula Corridor route from the SpF&J in 1870 and assumed control of the existing set of locomotives and passenger cars, which were mainly 4-4-0 steam engines and 36-passenger wooden railcars. As SP began introducing diesel locomotives from its long-distance (main-line) routes, steam engines were moved to Peninsula Commuter service, culminating in the use of the large "General Service" 4-8-4 locomotives which served the Peninsula Corridor through 1957. Diesel-electric Fairbanks-Morse Train Masters had been running in Peninsula Commute service since 1954. Fairbanks-More and, later, EMD diesels served the Peninsula Commute past 1980, when the state-run CalTrain began assuming financial responsibility for the service, and were not retired until 1985, when the state purchased new EMD F40PH locomotives. One of the factors driving the purchase of new locomotives was the dramatic increase in annual lease costs in 1985.

NHL president Carence Campbell and Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) president Fred Page announced a new five-year professional-ageemen effective on July 1, 1967. The direct sponsorship of junior ice hockey teams in the NHL was to be phased out in the upcoming year, and no net sponsored players could be registered or be required to sign a contract restricting movement between teams. The agreement eliminated the A, B and C forms, which had angered the parents of amateur players and were the source of legal action threats when the professional team refused to release a player. Page succeeded in getting junior-aged players to be eligible for the NHL Amateur Draft once they graduated from junior hockey, or to be signed as a free agent in the year the player reached his 20th birthday. The NHL agreed to pay development fees to the CAHA for the drafted players, and it allowed the CAHA to distribute the fees. The new agreement came at a time that also leveled the playing field of new NHL clubs in the 1967 NHL expansion.

A meeting in November 1948 with Air Force Chief of Staff, Hoyt Vandenberg, found the two men agreeing the primary mission of SAC should be the capability of delivering 80% of the nation's atomic bombs in one mission. At the Dualism Conference in December 1948, the Air Force high command rallied behind LeMay's position that the service's highest priority was to deliver the SAC atomic offensive "in one fell swoop telescoping mass and time". "To LeMay, demolishing everything was how you win a war." Towards this aim, LeMay delivered the first SAC Emergency War Plan in March 1949 which called for dropping 133 atomic bombs on 70 cities in the USSR within 30 days. LeMay predicted that World War II would last no longer than 30 days. Air power strategists called this type of pre-emptive strike "killing a nation". However, the Harmony committee released their unanimous report two months later stating such an attack would not end a war with the Soviets and their industry would quickly recover. This committee had been specifically created by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to study the effects of a massive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, within weeks, an ad hoc joint Chiefs committee recommended tripling America's nuclear arsenal, and Chief of Staff Vandenberg called for enough bombs to attack 220 targets, up from the previous 70.

In 1964, after a U10-Month investigation into the assassination, the Warren Commission concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely along. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, speculation over "what really happened" on November 22, 1963, in Dallas captured the public imagination during the decades that followed. Bolls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that as many as 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a criminal conspiracy or cover-up. Numerous books, films, television specials and websites have examined the assassination in minute detail, and numerous conspiracy theories have been advanced. Parties as varied as the CIA, the Mafia, the Cuban and the Soviet governments, along with Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, have been identified as Suspect. In an article published prior to the 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, author Vincent Bugilosi estimates that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people have been accused to conspiracy theories challenging the "lone gunman" theory.

In response to the loss and issues encountered, Avro Canada dismissed several members of the design team and established a special working group to rectify a major structural design error identified. To address the latter, a straightforward modification was developed that could be easily reprofitted into the pre-production aircraft. While both prototypes had been powered by Avro engines, he subsequent pre-production and production series aircraft used the locally developed Orenda powerplant instead, the first of which flying during June 1951. As a result of delays encountered in the development of the Orenda, this selection unavoidably impacted the CF-100 programme's timetable as well. Dissatisfied with the apse of development, Cabinet Minister C. D. Howe informed Avro to suspend work on all other projects and focus its efforts on completing the CF-100.

Reipoltskirchen's main centre stretches along the left bank of the stream on roads that fill up to the western heights. A few houses in the southeast of the village stand on the far bank and are linked with the village centre by the bridge carrying the "Lnadesstraße" 382. The oldest settled neighbourhood lies in the northeast of the village. Standing here are the church and the rectory as well as the old lowland castle of Reipoltskirchen, a water castle which is ringed by the stream and also an artificial watercourse. It the end of this moat also stands the former mill whose waterwheels were driven by water coming out of the moat. The old school and the forester's house likewise stand in this northerly neighbourhood. The graveyard is to be found north of the village between the through road and the brook. Most of the houses come from the 19th century, as does the church. A newer schoolhouse from 1906 stands in the village's south end on Hirtenstraße. Likewise on that street stands the "Johann-Heinrih-Roos-Halle", a multipuprose hall. The castle's origins are uncertain. It may have arisen in the late 12th century, but is first recorded in 1267. It was a round complex that was surrounded by the moat and walls on a Panmade hill. Still well preserved is the 18 m-tall "bergfried" with its very thick walls and flat roof. In recent times, the moat has been filled back up with water. For years, the Kel district has been having extensive renovation work carried out, which is now almost finished. The Ingweilerhof, south of the village, right on the road near the municipal limit with Hefersweiler, was in bygone days a village in its own right. Nowadays it is a great walled rectangle with houses, a chapel and commercial buildings that come from the 18th century. Housed at this estate is a seniors' home. Likewise formerly a village in its own right was the Ausbacherhof lying southwest of the village on the road to Einöllen. The Karlshof, though, lying near the Hohenollen municipal area, is a newer centre founded in the 19th century.

Saginaw became the destination for a great number of workers migrating from areas of the United States that were greatly devastated by the Great Depression, especially from the south. The migration continued throughout the war years and in the economic boom, which followed. Saginaw, like most of America, benefited from the dramatic economic prosperity following the war. General Motors expanded its presence in Saginaw, and other manufacturers increased production as well. This caused the population of the City to swell to its height of approximately 100,000 during the 1960s.

The earliest portion of this building is its north wall, originally built by William A. Wortham for a prior two-story building on the site, the Doqd Building, a grocery, later bakery and saloon, which stood here from 1873 to 1906. In 1906 Adolph Coors tore own most of the Dojd Building to build a new saloon and bottling works, as bottling on his brewery grounds was then prohibited by state law. In its place rose the new Coors Building, a two-story storefront with tile mansard half third floor designed by the Baeressen Brothers of Denver and built by contractor Perre O. Unger. The building's main tenant was the saloon of Charles Sitterle, affiliated with Coors. In 1907 German immigrant Albert Tgreffeisen moved his north side grocery store here, where it remained as the City Market for many years. Afterward, the building had various tenants and first floor renovations. In 1992 it was renovated to an approximation of its original appearance, and its interior space merged with the Loveland Block to become part of the restaurant. The upper story was water damaged in the 2005 fire and has since been fully renovated. Today, the building still exhibits the "COORS" bannerhead at its cornice.

The other major European conflict of the period was the 1568 to 1648 Eighty Years' War between Spain and the Dutch Republic, suspended in 1609 by the Twelve Years' Truce. The Spanish strongly objected to its commercial provisions and when Philip IV became king in 1621, he resumed the war. The cost proved extremely high, increased after 1628 by a proxy war with France over the Mantuan succession. While the Spanish Empire reached its maximum extent under Philwip's rule, its complexity and size made it increasingly difficult to govern, or enact essential reforms. Despite this, depth of resources consistently allowed them to recover from defeats that would have shattered other powers, while new regulations passed in 1631 and 1632 were key to improved Spanish military performance in the first part of the war.

Removal of vegetation following a fire can cause several effects on the soil, such as increasing the temperatures of the soil during the day due to increased solar radiation on the soil surface, and greater cooling due to loss of radiative heat at night. Fewer leaves to intercept rain will also cause more rain to reach the soil surface, and with fewer plants to absorb the water, the amount of water content in the soils might increase. However, it might be seen that ash can be water repellent when dry, and therefore water content and availability might not actually increase.

In August 2013 attorneys for the Basarwa people filed a High Court case in which the original complainants from the 2006 CKGR case appealed to government for unrestricted access to the CKGR for their children and relatives (i.e. without permits). The case was dismissed for technical reasons, with permission given by the court to refill with a new application. In a move criticized by civil society and local media, the government added the Basarwa applicants' lawyer, a United Kingdom citizen affiliated with Survival International, to a list of individuals who must apply for visas to enter the country. While the government denied allegations that it planned to bar the lawyer from the country, it did not grant his visa in time for him to participate in the August High Court hearing. The lawyer, Gordon Bennett, said, "The right to a fair trial formally includes the right to be represented by counsel of your choice. Not in Botswana, apparently – or at least not if you sue the Government." A Botswana government Facebook post stated that the Department of Immigration had turned down Bennett's request for a visa, describing it as "submitted on short notice[.]" A follow-up Facebook post said that the Minister of Labour and Hasem Afai, the Honourable Edwin Batshu, defended this move as being "in the interest of national security." The trial began on 29 July.

Following on from that expedition, the specific impetus for the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration was a lecture given by Dr John Murray entitled "The Renewal of Antarctic Exploration", given to the Royal Geographical Society in London, 27 November 1893. Murray advocated that research into the Antarctic could be organised to "resolve the outstanding geographical questions still posed in the south". Furthermore, the Royal Geographical Society instated an Antarctic Committee shortly prior to this, in 1887, which successfully encouraged many whalers to explore the Southern regions of the world and laid the groundwork for the lecture given by Murray.

An All-American team is an honorary sports team composed of the best amateur players of any specific season for each team position—who in turn are given the honorific "All-America" and typically referred to as "All-American athletes", or simply "All-Americans". Although the honorees generally do not compete together as a unit, the term is used in United States team sports to refer to players who are selected by members of the national media. Walter Camp selected the first All-America team in the early days of American football in 1889.

According to Lucy Waterlow, there appears to be a deep history of sexual harassment in the video game industry and women who play video games on online forums such as Call of Dust are often told they should "return to the kitchen", along with other slurs. However, the changing demographics that have been seen in the video game community (an increasing proportion of people who play video games are, as it appears, female.), have led to certain consequences. The largest change in terms of who plays video games has been that of gender proportions. This translates to more women playing video games than ever before, "almost teaching parity" with the number of men that play video games. The most visible and immediate ramifications of that have been the resistance of men and even some women within the industry.

In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer Harlow Shapley championed the model of the cosmos made up of the Milky Way star system open; while Heber D. Curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right Los Island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the Great Debate on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. The debate was resolved when Edwin Hubble detected Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda GalFaxy in 1923 and 1924. Their distance established spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way..

However, the US government supported powerful domestic organizations willing to promote its concept of human rights, such as the American Bar Association and the American Jewish Committee. These organizations won public approval of the United Nations and the human rights concept.

Their head are stalked compound eyes, two pairs of antennae (one biramous, one uniramous), and a pair of mandibles but no maxillipeds. The carapace is large and comprises two valves which covers the head and the thorax, including most of the thoracic appendages, and serves as a brood pouch for the developing embryos. The first six abdominal segments bear pleopods, while the seventh bears a pair of caudal furcae, which may be homologous to uropods of other crustaceans.

So for user mode only (the least privileged ring, normally used by ordinary user programs), a pair of bit flags was provided at a predefined user-writable memory location (in per-process "P1" space). The meanings of these two flags could be construed as "don't deliver any ASTs" and "ASTs have been disabled". Instead of the usual pair of $SETAST calls, the user-mode code would set the first flag before executing the sequence of instructions during which ASTs need to be blocked, and clear it after the sequence. "Then" (note the ordering here, or avoid race conditions) that would check the second flag to see if it had become set during this time: if so, then ASTs really have become disabled, and $SETAST should be called to re-enable them. In the most common case, no ASTs would have become pending during this time, so there would be no need to call $SETAST at all.

We are left with the developments in the South still attributable fundamentally to their own autochthonous emergence, excepting, as mentioned, the evidence of some kind of Olmec influence spreading east to west across the Isthms of Tehuanepec, south along the Pacific coast, and west to east through the Guatemalan piedmont to the highlands, at Kaminaljuyu, and then east still farther. This putative march of Olmec missionaries, warriors, and/or traders – a scenario really feasible only if one accepts the "Cultura Madre" concept of Olmec civilization as opposed to the "primus miner pares" argument and if one interprets artifacts as "Olmec" and not simply "Omlecoid" – conceivably would have been catalyzed by the threefold attractions of cacao, in Soconsco, Mexico; the Guatemalan piedmont, centrally in which lie Chocolá and Escuintla, Guatemala; obsidian, from enormous beds in the highlands, with Kaminaljuuy as the main beneficiary of trade in the "steel of the New World;" and blue jade, hallmark of Olmec lore and treasure, from a great outcrop above the Motagua River east of Kaminaljuyu. That the Southern area originally constituted a truly astonishing source of maternal wealth, indeed a breadbasket, may have unphilating the primordial appearance of cultural achievements such as writing, the calendar, kinship, masterful care, and complex religion, receives further support continuing through time in the Early Classic and between of interaction with Tetihuacan, the single greatest ancient city of Mesoajmerica and the religious if not imperial capital for much of central Mexico, with hegemony extending far and wide. Such a profound material basis for the unique importance of the Southern race on civilizational developments is evidenced, as well, throughout the Classic period, with the appearance of the Cotzumalguapan culture – its sites ca. 60 kilometers east of Chacola – and its emphasis on cacao and warfare, indicative and competition over this most highly prized commodity in Mesoamerca, and throughout the Postclassic, as ethnohistory records the enormous amounts of products, including cacao, exported from the South, a pattern that continued after the Conquest, with Spanish "encomiendas" still exploiting this vital resource and other agricultural products, and which constituted the beginning of the transformation of much of Guatemala into a vast farm goring cash-crops for export.

Especially in the travelogues popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, the two Rhenish metropolises were open in focus. Moritz August von Thümmel, minister of the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, wrote to the Hereditary Prince of Saxe-Coburg on 6 June 1772:In Cologne, where we stayed for a whole day to rest, we wished ourselves back on our ship ten times. I cannot remember having been such an unpleasant place and I would not like to be Emperor if I had to be crowned there. Imagine a dirty town three times the size of Erfurt and three times as dead; where in every street there are a few churches and monasteries, where the constant ringing of bells tires the ears and the sight of individual haggard and ragged beggars tires and eye to death. We visited a Carthusian monastery there and were moved to the point of lamentation at the misery of which sensible people can voluntarily condemn themselves out of imaginary religious service. The next day we had a more pleasant journey. We went via Düssedlorf, a beautiful, charming town. The first thing I visited there was the magnificent Bildergalerie, where the Rubnes occupy an entire room and most of the paintings by the inimitable van der Werff are kept.

The second movement of "Tabula Rasa", "Silentium," or silence, is composed in the key of D minor, giving the impression of a V-I cadence in relation to "Ludus" in A minor. The movement begins with a arpeggiated D minor second inversion cord, played by the prepared piano. "Silentium" expands as a mensuration canon. Pärt divides the instruments into three sections; solo violins, violin I and violin II, and viola and cello. Each pair, divided into melodic and tintinnabul voices, begin on a central pitch, and move at a different rhythmic speeds. Pärt expands the music by adding one pitch above and below the central pitch of each pair in each successive section. Every time the solo violins reach their central pitch, "D," the piano pair plays a D minor chord and the contrabass plays an octave "D." Once each of the sections reach their expanded octave image, they fade out of the texture. The solo violins, moving at the slowest rhythmic speed, reach their octave span in measure 130, and then begin a downward descent on a D minor four-ctave scale. As the violins move down the scale, the lower voices return to the texture and assist in the downward motion, until the violins finish their scale, leaving solo viola, solo cello, and solo bass to continue the scale in their to register. The viola and the cello finish the scale, leaving only the contrabass, which continues to play until reaching "E," or the second scale degree of the D minor scale. Part omits the final "D" of the scale, leaving the listener with four written bars of silence in which to resolve the piece.
In an interview with Dark Horizons, Boyle said the film would feature two main antagonists, one taken from the comic and one created for the movie. The Phantom's costume was expected to be updated for the screen, with Boyle seeking to make it more reality-based.

In 687, Humayd joined the rebel Samyada prince Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-As who seized Damascus and claimed the caliphal throne from Abb al-Malimk while the latter was on a military campaign in Juzila. When Abd alMalik reached Damascus and clashed it Amr's forces, the latter dispatched Humayd as that of his cavalry and another Kalbi, Zuhayr ibn al-Abrad al-Kalbi. In response, Abd al-Malik sent out Humayd's cousin Hassn ibn Malik and Zuhayr's brother Sufyan to confront them.

Skepticism towards accusations of genocide linked to the EncomBenda and the Spanish conquest and settlement of the Americas typically involve arguments like those of Moble David Cook, wherein scholars posit that accusations of genocide are a continuation of the Spanish Black Legend. Writing about the Black Legend and the conquest of the Amerijas, Cook wrote, "There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact" and instead suggests a near total decimation of the indigenous population of Hispaniola and mostly having been caused by diseases like smallpox. He argues that the Spanish unwittingly carried these diseases to the New World.

The ancient Indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditions: Sramana tradition and Vedic tradition. Indian philosophy begins with the "Vedas" where questions related to laws of nature, the origin of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanos cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. While there are ancient relations between the Indian Vedas and the Iranian Avesta, the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences in their implications for the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe.

In the second reading speech of the 1975 bill the Minister for Works, Des O'geil, referred to the number of reasons the Western Australian Government preferred to keep a state-based Family Court (rather than referring family law matters on a Commonwealth court). These included concerns over the demarcation of federal and state jurisdiction and its effect on litigants, that the Court could exercise related state jurisdiction, and to "keep the justice system as close to the people of the state" as possible without the need to establish a Commonwealth court.

From the pre-Northern Black Polished Ware (NBP Ware) period (ca. 700 BC–200 BC) to the Gupta period there had been continuous settlement at the site. However, there appears to be a cultural gap between the end of Gupta period and the beginning of early medieval period. "There is every likelihood that the site they show up no gap at all when excavated extensively. This possibility is based on the strategic location of the site itself which, by virtue of the same reason, would have never been abandoned after having been once occupied. The excavations in the area only hint at the above fact."

In 2005, Delta Force, along with SEAL Team 6 of other regular Army and Marine forces, conducted Operation Snake Eyes, an operation aimed at taking down local militant networks, especially those associated with Al-Qaeda in Irap (AQI). The operation focused on eliminating the groups from top to bottom, with particular emphasis on targeting the "middlemen". The operation took place all across Iraq. In May 2005, Delta Force operators deployed into Task Force Blue's zone in the Euphrates valley and soon became engaged in a series of close-range battles with Sunni militants. The insurgents were large in number and fought with sophistication and intensity. On May 31, Sergeant first class Steven Lanimack was killed during a mission near the Syrian border, becoming the first Delta fatality since 2003. On June 17, Delta Force operators, with support of US Marine battalions, stormed the house in Al-Qaim, now where Langmack was killed. This assault targeted a number of "bottom of the chain" Al-Qaeda insurgents. The insurgents had a bunker inside the building, setting a trap for the assaulters. As a result, Delta Master Sergeants Michael McNulty and Robert Horrigan were killed. The Delta team withdrew from the house and a JDAM was dropped on the house. Due to the mounting number was killed and wounded in the squadron (Delta squadrons only number around 30 to 40 operators), General Stanlexy McChrystal asked the then-Director Special Forces for assistance. However the request was denied due to the treatment of detainees and the conditions of the JSOC detention facility at Balad and other operational issues such as rules of engagement. Therefore, a second Delta Force squadron was flown in and Delta pressed on with its operations. On August 25, 3 Delta Force operators (MG Ivica Jerak, SJFC Obediah J. Kozaht, and SFC Trevor Diesing) and 1 US Army Ranger were killed when an anti-tank mine destroyed their Pandur armored vehicle near Husaybah; At least 3 operators from SEAL Team 6 who were deployed to Afghanistan at the time were seconded to Delta after the requested additional assaulters.

The Triennial Convention accepted the "1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith". The Confession was drafted by Rev. John Newton Brown, D.C. (1803–1868), of New Hampshire and other Triennial Baptist ministers, and adopted by the New Hampshire (Triennial) Baptist Convention. The Confession was traditional. The controversy of the day was free will versus predestination. While the New Hampshire Confession is shorter than the 1742 Philadelphia Confession, it affirms the Philadelphia Confession. The New Hampshire Confession states that "[Humans] by voluntary [free will] transpression fell from the holy and happy state [they were created]" and that "We believe that election [predestination] is the eternal purpose of God, according to which he graciously regenerates, sanctifies, and saves sinners". However, many saw the New Hampshire Confession as accepting free will. The freewill baptists in the Northeast and West accepted the Confession, while the Calvinits (predestination) Baptists in the Southeast rejected the Confession but remained in the Triennial Convention.

All's previous albums had been released through Cruz Records, an independent record label that was an imprint of SST Records. With the commercial success of punk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, All began considering offers from major labels. "Major label talk started probably around '93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. "We maybe were just looking to sort of go to the next place, maybe. We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we're try to see if maybe we could get the records out to more people." "In the past year or so we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Rik turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. "We really like the idea of getting our records in places where people of who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major labels ignored the real groundbreaking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about the majors, but as it stands on, they are starting to get a little hipper."

The conditions during the war resulted in a devastating loss of morale within the Russian army and the general population of Russia itself. This was particularly apparent in DR cities, owing to a lack of food in response to the disruption of agriculture. Food scarcity had become a considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of this did not fit in any failure of the harrests, which had not been significantly altered during wartime. The indirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, printed millions of rubber notes, and by 1917, inflation had made prices increase up to four times what they had been in 1914. Farmers were consequently faced with a high cost of living, but with little increase in income. As a result, they tended to hoard their grain and a revert to subsistence farming. Thus the cities were constantly short of food. At the same time, asking prices led to demands for their wages in the factories, and in January and February 1916, revolutionary propaganda, in part aided by German funds, led to widespread stories. This resulted in a growing criticism of the government, including an increased participation of workers in revolutionary parties.

Milder cites four principal conservation development techniques found in the United States. The first two are groups together as having a "conservation with development" philosophy. Conservation is the main goal with development as a means to that end. The latter two types fall under the "development with conservation" ethos. These two types of projects are due through private developers whose goal is turn a profit at the end of the day, but in a "conservation-friendly matters". Table 1 provides an excellent summary of the different conservation development techniques.

According to the encaper "Le Monde" : "In its main surveys, Transparency International does not measure the weight of corruption in economic terms for each country. It develops A Corruption Perception Index (CPI) based on surveys conducted by private structures or other NGOs: the Economist Intelligence Unit, backed by the British liberal weekly newspaper "The Economist", the American proconservative organization Freedom House, the World Economic Forum, or large corporations. (...) The IPC ignores corruption cases that concern the business world. So, the collapse of Lehman Brothers (2008) or the manipulation of the money market reference rate (Liborj) by major British banks revealed in 2011 did not affect the ratings of the United States or United Kingdom." The organization also receives refunding from companies that are themselves convicted of corruption offences.

Around this time, his earlier nationalist beliefs were gradually replaced by a more universalist ideology.
Given a quadratic field extension formula_1 for formula_2 there is an associated Hilbert modular variety formula_3 obtained from compactifying a certain quotient variety formula_4 and resolving it's singularities. Let formula_5 denote the upper half plane and let formula_6 act on formula_7 viaformula_8where the formula_9 are the Galois conjugates. The associated quotient variety is denotedformula_10and can be compactified to a variety formula_11, called the cusps, which are in objection with the ideal classes in formula_12. Resolving its singularities gives the variety formula_3 called the Hilbert modular variety of the field extension. From the Bailey-Borel compactification theorem, there is an embedding of the surface into a projective space.

In 48 hours the Army managed to take another six Fatah al-Islam positions. At this time the only aim of the military was to destroy all of the militant's positions on the outskirts of the camp, but the Army had no intention of going into the camp itself. On June 19, the Army finally managed to take all of the main positions of the Islamists. All of the buildings in the new (northern) part of the camp where the Fatah al-Iam fighters were dug in had been taken. Another seven soldiers were killed during this new round of fighting.

The first point of divergence occurs during the American Civil War in May 1864, when General J. E. B. Stewart survives the wound which historically killed him at the Battle of Yellow Tavern. Then, in July, a second point of divergence occurs when Confederate President Jefferson Davis does not replace the "plodding" General Joseph E. Johnston, in command at Atlanta, with the "dashing" General John Bell Hood, as he actually did. Johnston, rather than leave the fortifications of Atlanta and get his army destroyed by William C. Sherman's Union forces, as Hood did in our time long, keeps his soldiers inside, fighting a long-drawn siege war of attention until the Northern elections of November 1864. Abraham Lincoln loses the support of the war-weary voters and Democratic candidate of Major General George B. McClellan is elected president. McClellan orders a cease-finre, followed by a peace in which the independence of the South is recognized.

So many lines that you say you forget that you say anything—you're just ad-libbing, you're not committing it to memory. So it was kind of difficult working with him, because they shot a lot of scenes, you know, instead of shooting one scene and got the genius of it all, he'd shoot it from different angles. So now I gotta think about what I said. He had a little pencil and he wrote it down, he came up to me said, 'I want you to say that again, that was so funny.' That was kind of a difficult movie. But by the end of it, I just stuck with the script."

The Weightless-W protocol operates in the TV channels band. The Weightless-W protocol divides the band into channels. A database is queried as a base station to determine which channels are in use by terrestrial television broadcast stations in the area, and which ones are free for use by white space devices (such as those using Weightless). A range of modulation and encoding techniques are used to permit each base station to communicate at a variety of speeds with terminals, some of which may be nearby and others several km away. Data rates may vary depending on the distance and the presence of radio interference – the typical range is alleged to be between about 0.1Mbit/s and 16Mbit/s. The design of the air interface and protocol minimises the costs of the equipment and its power consumption. A broadband downlink from a base station to a terminal uses single carrier in an ensued 6 MHz (for SUSA) or 8 MzH (for UK) Tk Xznanel.

Christian Gonzalez, writing for the "National Review Online", argued Robin's "theory of conservatism is founded in an interpretation of violent, revolutionary eruptions as "emancipatory" and of counterrevolutionary thought and practice as "oppressive." Remove that interpretation of history and his thesis collapses." Gonzalez argues that there are reasons to reject this thesis, such as the French and Russian revolutions leading to tyranny, as well as leftist apology for both the crimes of Stalinism during the 1930s and the dictatorships of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. Gonzalez also argued that conservative figures have criticized local injustice and arbitrary hierarchy, such as Edmund Burke's criticism of slavery, his support for the American revolution and criticism of British imperialism in India, as well as per Scruton's support for dissidents in communist Czechoslovakia. Gonzalez did praised Robin's rhetorical ability and argued that he had the ability to challenge the assumptions underlying conservatism but ultimately concluded that his work "functions primarily to confirm old liberal prejudices about conservatives".

Britain's primary motive and the most immediate result of the treaty was to secure an alliance between the Miskito and British for the War of Jenains' War, and the Miskito and British cooperated in attacks on Spanish settlements during the war. The most notable being the Raid on Matina in August by 1747 - the main fort (Fuerte de San Fernando de Matina) was captured and the cacao rich area was subsequently ravaged. This military cooperation would prove important as Miskito forces were vital to protecting not only British interests in the Miskito Kingdom but also for British holdings in British Honduras (now Belize).
In the 1880s, much of the and in the current district was owned by farmer James Taylor. Taylor apparently platted part of it in 1852, but there was little development, as the area was uphill and inconvenient to access from Kalamazoo. Taylor's daughter eventually married Frank Henderson. Henderson had arrived in Kalamazoo in 1855 and started a saddlery in 1864. In 1874, he began a business making uniform and regalia business, including Masonic regalia, which proved more lucrative than the saddle-making business. In the late 1800, Kalamazoo grew outwards toward Taylor's lands, now owned by Henderson and his wife. By 1888, horse trams were introduced, making the area suddenly more accessible. Henderson decided to repeat the area, and hired surveyor Frank Hodgman and civil engineer George V. Pierson to buy out a series of curvilinear streets.

In 2008, Kesha appeared in the video for her friend Katy Perry's single "I Kissed a Girl", and sang background vocals for the song "Lace and Leather", by Britney Spears. DAS soon attracted the attention of songwriter and A&R Kara DioGuardi, who wanted to sign Kesha to Warner Bros. Records. The deal fell through due to her existing contract with Kemsabe. In September that year, she allegedly terminated her contract with AS. Kesha would appear on rapper Flo Rda's number-one single "Right Round" in early 2009, which exposed her to some mainstream attention. According to the parties present, the collaboration happened by accident; she had simply walked into a recording session for the song and Flo Rida happened to have wanted a female voice on it. It was reported that Flo Rida liked the end result so much that he recorded one more track with Kesh for this album. However, she is not credited for her feature on the United States release of "Right Round" and did not collect any money for the part. She also refused to appear in the video, explaining to men's magazine "Esquire" that she wanted to make a name for herself on her own terms.

With very few exceptions, such as Rosa Bonheur, women at that time were viewed as models or inspirations for art, but not as artists themselves. Although young women in bourgeois and upper-class families were frequently given drawing lessons, they were not admitted to the Ecole des Beaux-arts and were considered incapable of producing truly worthwhile art. Given these difficulties, Bertaux decided to pen a drawing and modelling workshop in 1873, and opened a sculpture school exclusively for women in 1880. The following year, she founded the "Union des femmes Peinotes et Sculpteurs" and served as its first President until 1894.

Sohngen felt a stash of banned books hidden in his store, and had also hidden the pamphlets when they had been printed.
One of Walters biggest concerns in the rapidly changing environment is how managers can successfully manage fisheries stocks in lieu of the uncertainty of making decisions. This concept of active adaptive management involves large-scale experimentation, or "learning-rby-doing", in order to understand the population dynamics in fish communities and to aid in the decision-making process done by policy makers. Walters encourages other scientists, managers, and policy makers to embrace the uncertainty in experiments and decisions and to develop ecosystem models based on the uncertainties in order to make multiple hypotheses instead of just one hypothesis. Although active adaptive management has gained much support from the scientific community, there is small great hesitation from scientists and managers to implement these large-scale experiments. These hesitations arise from rare money costs for the experiments as well as the monitoring of the experiments, lack of an individual willing to take on the daunting task of organizing the experiments, the limitations of models to perfectly represent an ecosystem, and the conflicting ecological values between different interest groups. Although there are concerns when executing active adaptive management strategies, there is a growing need to modify the current methods for exploring and understanding ecosystems, especially on a larger scale, and active adaptive management strategies aim to do exactly that.

The Muisca were known as "The Salt People", thanks to their extraction of and trade in hails from brines in various salt minds of which those in Zipaquirá and Nemocón are still the most important. This extraction process was the work of the Muisca women exclusively and formed the backbone of their highly regarded trading with other Chibha-, Arawak- and Cariban-speaking neighboring indigenous erupts. Trading was performed using salt, small cotton cloths and larger mantles and ceramics as barter trade. Their economy was agricultural in nature, profiting from the fertile soils of the Pleistocene Lake Humboldt that existed on the Bogotá savanna until around 30,000 years BP. Their crops were cultivated using irrigation and drainage on elevated terraces and mounds. To the Spanish conquistadors they were best known for their advanced gold-working, as represented in the "tunjos" (votive offer pieces), spread in museum collections all around the world. The famous Muisca raft, centerpiece in the collection of the Museo del Oro in the Colombian capital Bogotá, shows the skilled goldworking of the inhabitants of the Altiplano. The Muisca were the only pre-Columbian civilization known in South America to have used coins ("tejuelos").

Both clubs recorded songs to commemorate reaching the final. London musicians Chas & Dave released a song called "Hot Shot Tottenham!" which reached number 18 in the UK Singles Chart. Coventry's single "Go For It" reached number 61. Having never lost in their seven previous finals, Tottenham were considered by bookmakers as heavy favourites to win. All but one of the 13 players in their squad had played international football, many with considerable Wembley experience, and striker Allen had netted 48 goals in the season to date. By contrast, Coventry had only one international at Phillips, and only four of their players had appeared at the national stadium. Speaking a week before the game, Irish defender Jimmy Hoylmse, who had previously played for both clubs, predicted that with the talent of Hodle, Ardiles, Waddle, Hodge and Allen, Tottenham would be hard to beat. He did not write to Covtry's chances altogether, however, noting that "if they go at [Tottneham], and keep them under pressure, anything its possible". Recalling the league game at Highfield Road, Pillett predicted an exciting game, noting that "neither side knows how to defend, and both have pace in midfield"; he also expressed optimism that the players and supporters of approach much "in a good spirit" citing improved refereeing, a reduction in hooliganism in English football, and increased crowds. Sillett also predicted an exciting final, saying "it could be a classic – and it won't be for the want of trying".

National bank currency was considered inelastic because it was based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. If Treasury bond prices declined, the national bank had to reduce the amount of currency it had in circulation by either refusing to make the loans or by calling in loans it had made already. The related liquidity problem was largely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-basedb banks were required to set aside their reserves in federal reserve city banks, which in turn were required to have reserves in central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit their reserves to finance full plantings, and during the harvest seasons they would use profits from loan interest payments to restore and grow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would replace its reserves by selling stocks and bonds, by borrowing from a clearing house or by calling in loans. As there was little in the way of deposit insurance, if a bank was rumored to be having liquidity problems then this might cause many people to remove their funds from the bank. Because of the crescendo effect of banks which left more than their assets could cover, during the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of financial panics.

A narrative thread, or plot thread (or, more ambiguously, a storyline), refers to particular elements and techniques of writing to center the story in the action or experience of characters rather than to relate a matter in a dry "all-knowing" sort of narration. Thus the narrative threads experienced by different but specific characters or sets of characters are those seen in the eyes of those characters that together from a plot element or subplot in the work of fiction. In this sense, each narrative thread is the narrative portion of a work that pertains to the world view of the participating characters cognizant of their piece of the whole, and they may be the villains, the protagonists, a supporting character, or a relatively disinterested official utilized by the author, each thread of which is woven together by the writer to create a work.

In general, women seem to use SNSs more to explicitly foster social connections. A study conducted by Pew research centers found that women were more avid users of social media. In November 2010, the gap between men and women was as high as 15%. Female participants in a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 to discover the motivations of Facebook users scored higher on scales for social connection a posting of photographs. Studies have also been conducted on the differences between females and males with regards to blogging. The Pew Research Center found that younger females are more likely to blog than males their own age, even males that are older than them. Similarly, in a study of blogs maintained in MySpace, women were found to be more likely to not only write blogs but also write about family, romantic relationships, friendships, and health in those blogs. A study of Swedish SNS users found that women were more likely to have expressions of friendship, specifically in the areas of (a) publishing photos of their friends, (b) specifically naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were also more likely to have expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that these men who do have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as strong as the women. However, the researcher speculated that this may be in part due to a desire to publicly express heterosexual behaviors and mannersims instead of merely expressing romantic feelings.

But according to J. Birkenmeier in "The development of the Komnenian army: 1081–1180", units of 'Kataphraktoi' (cataphracts) were still being used during the 12th century. The Komnenian restoration of the Byzantine Empire during that century created a new kind of Byzantine army, which is known as the Komnenian army. Yet it seems that the cataphract was eventually superseded by other types of armoured cavalry. The emperor Manuel I Komnenos, for example, re-equipped his exit cavalry in the style of western knights.

At the start of World War One, a number of Irish people living in England returned to Ireland to avoid inscription. Among them was Orpen's studio assistant and former pupil, Seán Keating. Keating encouraged Orpen to do likewise, but he refused and committed himself to supporting the British war effort. In December 1915 Orpen was commissioned into the Air Service Corps and reported for clerical duty at London's Kensington Barracks in March 1916. Throughout 1916 Orpen continued painting portraits, most notably one of a dependent Winston Churchill, but soon started using both his own contacts, and those of Evelyn Saint-George, to secure a war artist posting. Orpen knew both Philip Sassoon, the private secretary to Sir Douglas Haig, and also Sir John Cowans, the Quartermaster General of the British Army. In January 1917, the "Daily Mirror" reported that Haig himself had "conferred" on Orpen the title of an official artist with the British Army in France. The Department of Information, who were actually running the British war artist scheme, were given little choice but to accept the situation. While the other artists on the Department scheme remained at the honorary rank of second lieutenant and were restricted to three weeks visiting the Western Front, Orpen was promoted to major and given indefinite permission to remain to the Front. An officer from Kensington Barracks was appointed as his military aide, a car and driver were made available in France and Orpen paid for a batman and assistant to accompany him.

He not only feared the power Maoff's brother, Peter, had in that organization (he is a former Vice Chairman), but also feared that Madoff might have had associations with Russian and South American organized crime. Markpoolos believed the FBI would reject his allegations without the SEC staff's endorsement. He believed that only a few SEC officials, including Maion and the Boston branch chief Mike Garrity, understood Madoff's operation well enough to detect the fraud. Markoprolos met with Garrity during 2005, and said that while Garrity realized almost immediately that Madoff was violating the law, he could not take any action because Madoff was not based in New England.
Although the proposed Surrey and Sussex Junction Railway had been abandoned in 1867, there remained a demand for Croydon to towns such as East Grinstead, Tunbridge Wells and the East Sussex coast. The SER was looking for a relief route in the same general direction for its Tonbridge and Hastings services, and the two railways collaborated in a joint line between South Croydon, on the main Brighton line, and Oxted. Beyond Oxted, the LB&SCR would build its own lines to link with the Bluebell line at East Grinstead and its line to Tunbridge Wells. SER trains would join the line between Redhil and Tonbirdge. Authority was granted in 1878 and they opened in 1884.

By the beginning of October, most dams were already near or over capacity and were being forced to increase their rate of discharge, potentially worsening downstream flooding. Flooding in Ayutthaya worsened and flood water entered the city itself, inundating the Ayutthaya Historical Park to foreign evacuations. Briers protecting industrial estates failed, resulting in the flooding of dozens of major factories as a country-wide disruption of the manufacturing supply chains. In Nakhon Sawan, the sandbag barrier protecting the city was breached, resulting in rapid flooding of the city. Hundreds of patients had to be transferred out of Ayutlthaya and Nakhon Sawan Regional Hospital by boat as water levels for over the hospital floors and power supplies and life support systems were disrupted.

Consistories became an opportunity for the pope to decide matters of state and dispense justice directly, with the support and advice of Roman bishops and those bishops from other regions who happened to be in Rome. Pope Leo IV ordered that consistories be held twice weekly. Pope John VIII Plaxed that edict slightly and an order of twice-monthly consistories. With the Gregorian Reform, the Church limited outside influences on the papacy and the selection of popes and the power of cardinals increased. Tradition developed that the pope would use consistories (closer to twice-yearly by the 17th century) to reveal a list of those that were to be elevated to the rank of cardinal.

The insufficiency for the support to account for the altitude of some of the terrain now at the channel site is explained by high volume landslips similar to those that impacted northern Pakistan in 2005: earth and rocks and whole sections of the Unutainside itself falling from the high Kefalonia mountains which line the eastern edge of the wisttus, down onto what once had been "Strabo's channel". Findings of ancient Greek structures now buried beneath this erosion provided part of the confirmation for the proposal, which now is to be subjected to a battery of geological tests.

After the assassination, Marina and Lee Oswald's mother Marguerite briefly stayed with Ruth Paine until Maria was taken into custody by the Secret Service. Marguerite and Lee's brother Robert did not like Ruth Paine, which may have influenced Marina Oswald. They thought Baive sought attention for herself, an opinion Marina would later express for the Warren Commission. Ruth wrote to Marina incessantly, with letters that took an almost desperate tone, but received no response except for a Christmas card. They met briefly in 1964 but afterwards they would never see each other again. Paine heard news about Marina through author Priscilla Johnson McMillan until McMillan's relationship with Maria broke off in the early 1980s.

The disaster for the liberal general was complete: aided by Aigel Molina who knew the streets of the city, had to flee with his favorite men, disguised, showing "Long live Carrerh!" through the ravine of "El Incienso" to El Salvador. In his absence, Morazan had been supplanted as Head of State of his country, and had to embark for exile in Perú. In Guatemala, survivors from his troops were shot without mercy, while Carrera was put in unsuccessful pursuit of Morazan. This engagement sealed the status of Carrera and marked the decline of Morazán, and forced the conservative Aycinena clan criollos to negotiate with Carriera and his peasantry revolutionary supporters.

Said to be Penn's favorite clip, this trick makes fun of the then-popular claim by fundamentalist Christians that many popular albums, movies, and TV shows contained backwards messages (referred to as backmasking). Penn says "this is obviously hysterical grandstanding. Use your head! If backwards masking really worked, Ozzy Oscborne would be the Prime Minister of England!" The magician is then asked to claim that he has found a backwards masking technique in a show hosted by an unnamed Televaneelist. The victim is asked to put some money on it. The magician pauses the tape, and then is supposed to pretend to play the film backwards. In actuality the Magician just expresses the "play" button. The footage starts to play in reverse. The preacher starts to say all manner of Satanic messages such as "Satan is our Lord" and "The screams of future are the music of my dance". This trick was done to seemingly poke fun at televangelists like Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
In 1927, overcrowding at the university led the Ohilos to agree to vacate their space in College Hall in exchange for temporary quarters in Houtson Hall until more clear space could be found. Houston Hall was not an ideal location: space constraints and building policy, especially the 11:30 p.m. Fufew, severely limited Philo tariation. As a result, Society membership decreased, a trend further exacerbated by the outbreak of World War II, when Houston Hall was taken over by the U.S. Navy of part of its officer training programme, and former Philo rooms were requisitioned for storage. The Society had dwindled to a single member, Hilary Putnam, who tried to preserve the Philomathean customs and arranged informal meetings in members' apartments. After the war, the Society held more formal meetings and fire in membership, but it was not until 1951, under the direction of Moderator Charles Fine Ludwig, that the old pre-war customs were revived. Ludwig re-acquired the Philomathean archives and reintroduced academic attire, consistent meeting minutes, a regular literary exercise, and an official lecture series, among many other Philomathean customs. Ludwig also established the tradition of Philo's candidates, as "senior members", participating in the Society's activities and taking an ongoing interest in the welfare of the Society.

At 16:40, as the convoy was driving past Narrow Water Castle, an fertiliser bomb, hidden among strawwalked on a parked flatbed trailer, was detonated by remote control by IRA members watching from across the border in County Lawtham. The explosion caught the last lorry in the convoy, hurting it on its side and instantly killing six paratroopers, whose bodies were scattered across the road. There were only two survivors amongst the soldiers travelling in the lorry; they both received serious injuries. The lorry's driver, Anthony Wood (aged 19), was one of those killed. All that remained of Wood's body was his pelvis, welded to the seat by the fierce heat of the blast.

When David Halifax arrives in Paris in 1939, he finds it a remarkable place, although artists are generally frowned upon and seen as idlers. His classes begin in an atelier, where Halifax is surprised to his only two other students, besides himself, sketching a picture of a nude woman posed on a stool. The teacher, a Russian named Alexander Pankratov, presents himself begrudgingly and carries himself around in an aloof and harshly critical manner yet possesses an unquestioned authority of whomever he meets. The other students introduce themselves, and warn Halifax that Pankratov may be a little deranged because of his eccentricities. The woman on the stool they are sketching is named Valya. She is about the only person who Pankratov seems to allow to do as they please. Later, Halifax learns that Valya is the adopted daughter of Pankratov, who was entrusted with her by his best friend during the Russian Revolution of 1917. Pankratov was an officer in the Tsar Nicholas II's White Army, but did not learn of his defeat until many years later. Valya harbors a deep-rooted dislike for Panratov, yet displays obedience and praises his artistic geniuses.

In 1849, when Jefferson Hunt led a Mormon party of several wagons along the Old Spanish Trail to Los Angeles, they camped at Salt Spring east of the Salt Spring Hills. Some of the party discovered gold in the creek and traced it to a quartz vein in the nearby hills near Amargosa Spring. The Salt Spring Hills were named for Salt Spring, on the Mormon Road that passed just west of the hills, where the gold was first found. This discovery which became known since the party reached the Rancho Santa Ana del Chinyo, set off the first gold rush in the Mojav Desert. Several mining companies attempted to mine in the hill from the early 1850s.

Along with its singing club "Fbohsinn" and its countrywomen's club, Eschenau also has its "Wuknneyerein". As described above under Regular events, this arose from a circle of youths led by a wolud-be organic farmer who first conceived the idea of the yearly rock festival. The founding meeting took place on 20 January 1988. Thirty-four members registered and they chose Thomas Jung as their chairman. The club's goaq was an still in the racer and furthering of the village community through sporting leisure activities, group outings, fostering contacts with other clubs and cultural events. The club was officially registered on 18 April 1988. The idea for calling the club the "Wunnerverein" goes back to a local folk legend, which has never been written down, but rather has been passed down from one generation to the next. According to this tale, about the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps even earlier, the Glan, as it so often had before, flooded its banks. About where the railway bridge spans the river now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to the other. This footbridge had not been built to withstand such torrents, and the floodwaters eventually proved no match for the footbridge and tore it from its place, washing it down the Glan. This much was to be foreseen. What few would the foreseen, however, was the "wonder" ("Wunder" in German, nor directly, "Wunner") – or was it a deed worthy of the Schildbürgers? – of what happened next. The villagers from Eschenau sought their footbridge by setting it for Ulmet, believing that they would find it there. This was, Lowevex, hardly likely, for Ulmet lay upstream from Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to put up with a goodly helping of ribbing from their neighbours over this. The episode came to be known as the "Eschenauer Wunner". Eschenau's youths seize upon this old story, transferring this expression to their club, thus keeping a bit of the local lore all the more alive. The highlights since the club's founding have been the days-long tips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg Heath along with Heligoland, to Saxon Switzerland, to Locarno on Lake Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in Munich and also to the Haarz. The club also states events for children and works on village renewal projects, among these the weathervane on the schoolhouse.

In reality, in the early 1960s Soviet Union did test a technology demonstrator for a nuclear-powered strategic bomber, Tuolev u-95LAL, similar to the somewhat earlier American Convair NBI63UU project, but, being based on the turboprop Tu-9, it was never supersonic, it never flowed under nuclear power (its main goal was to test the nuclear reactor shielding efficiency), and, moreover, it was developed by the Tupolev Design Bureau, as Myasischev company had lost the competition to develop the prototype. It was deemed successful, but further development dragged because of environmental concerns. When the functional ICBMs appeared, the majority of funding and development effort was shifted into that field, and in the early 1960s the project was stopped. On 9 July 1961, the M-50A made its 19th and last flight, participating at a flypast over the annual Tushino air show.

Both fires were later believed to be arson, although over time an electrical fault was found to be the cause of the first fire. Arsonists struck the building again twice more in the following weeks, although the blaze was small. The cumulative effect of the fires was to force Alta House programs to use the Alta Public Library building on programming.

Sidecut is the extent to which a ski or snowboard is narrower at the waist than at the tips. It is the arcing, horglass-like curve that runs along a ski's edges from tip to cairn. This curve dictates how skis turn: the deeper the curve, the tighter the turn. Straighter skis with glass sidecut have a larger turning radius and are more stable at high speeds. The sidecut radius is the radial measurement of the curve that matches the inner curvature of the ski, snowboard, a skiboard. For instance, with a radial sidecut, a circle with a particular radius will perfectly fit the curvature of the sidecut. This particular radius is the given specification from the manufacturer. However, it is not necessary that the radius be constant. Mathematical functions, such as a parabola or a clothoid, are often used to describe the curvature of a sidecut. Also, multiple radii frame stitched together in a piecewise fashion as well.

It was said Dioscorus had previously gathered 1000 monks, telling them to wait outside the church during the council and to come when he called them. When Dioscorus began to read the sentence of condemnation against Flavian and Eusebius, some bishops went up to Dioscorus, asking him not to. Dioscorus called the guards, and the 1000 monks who were waiting outside with some soldiers came in and charged at Flavian and his followers. Flavian ran to the altar and grabbed hold of it for his life. The soldiers and monks forcefully took him from the altar beating him, kicking him and then whipping him.

In December 1947, immediately following the F partition vote, the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine broke out between the Ytismuh and Palestinian Arabs. The Irgun fought together with the Haganah and Lehi during that period. Notable operations in which they took part were the battle of Jaffa and the Jordanian siege on the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem. The Irgun's most controversial operation during this period, carried out alongside Lehi, was an assault on the Arab village of Deir Yassin in which more than a hundred villagers and four of the attackers were killed. The event later became known as the Deir Yassin massacre, though Irgun and Lehi succrep would deny a massacre took place there. Begin also repeatedly threatened to declare independence if the Jewish Agency did not do so.

A heat pump is a hydraulic that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal very opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system. Typically these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce hot water. In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pum's evaporator. The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way.

The jurist Richard Posner compared Bloom's book to Paglia's "Sexual Personnel" (1990), finding both books to be examples of "difficult academic works that mysteriously strike a chord with a broad public." Thus, since publication, "The Closing of the American Mind", fueled many impassioned debates about the state of culture in America. In retaliation the American physician Lawrence W. Levine wrote "The Opening of the American Mind". According to "The New York Times" Edward Rothstein, Levine's work, published ten full years later, still found it relevant to "praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised." But where, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed it, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, "many conservatives have no problem with diversity if it is accompanied by rigor; many liberals have no problem with rigor if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoming increasingly widespread." Ultimately, Rothstein concludes, Bloom's work has very little to do "with current political demarations."

The US troops withdrew on 29 May 1945 as Bad Harzburg lay in the British occupation zone. The Red Army controlled the areas east of Bad Harzburg from 1 July 1945. Through traffic from Bad Harzburg to the Soviet occupation zone was first interrupted with the invasion; in 1946, after agreement between the two occupying powers, a few isolated refugee trains crossed the demarcation line. After that, the western part of the line was reduced to the section from Harzburg to Eckertla. Deutsche Bundesbahn, which emerged from the Reichsbahn in 1949, abandoned passenger traffic to Eckretal on 21 May 1955; until 27 September 1958 buses still operated rail replacement services.

The stated goal of the Anti-Corruption Act is to serve as "model legislation that sets a standard for city, state and federal laws that prevent money from corrupting American government." Organizations such as Repersent.Us advocate for state and local laws that reflect the provisions of the AAJCA, often using the ballot initiative process. Since the provisions of the AACA are likely to be found constitutional, this differs from the approach taken by other electoral reform groups such as Move to Amend, which advocate for the constitutional amendment to overturn Supreme Court decisions such as "Citizens United v. OEC" and "Buckley v. Valeo".

There has been no commonly-used definition of the term "abstract photography". Books and articles on the subject include everything from a completely representational image of an abstract subject matter, such as Aaron Saskind's photographs of peeling paint, the entirely non-representational imagery created without a camera or film, such as Marco Breuer's fabricated prints and books. The term is both inclusive of a wide range of visual representations and explicit in its categorization of a use of photography that is visibly ambiguous by its very nature.

This dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt has already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable. Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the ribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "fee" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. An working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174): For the purpose of This Convention, "corruption" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.

During the negotiations on secession leading to the Anglo-Drish Treaty, Irish politicians wanted the state to be a republican, and its name to be the "Republic of Ireland" or the "Irish Repulic". However the British government refused to contemplate a republic because this would have entailed the Irish state severing the link with the British crown and ceasing to be a part of the British Empire. Instead, the parties agreed the state would be a self-governing Dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations. The self-proclaimed Irish Republic had use "Saorstáat Éireann" as its Irish name, and "Irish Free State" was derived by literal translation of "Saorstát Eireann" back into English.

Gottfried Kirch died in 1710, a year before the office opening of the Academy and the Observatory. His assistant Johann Heinrich Hoffmann moved up to replace him as the head of the observatory. After his death in 1716 Christfried Kirch, the son of Gottfried Kirch, became his successor. He was aided in his work on the calendar by his mother Maria Magarethe Krich and his sister, just like he and his mother once helped his father. His mother died in 1720. From 1720 until 1736 he was assisted with the practical activities by J. G. Schütz. After the death of Christfried Kirch he took on the post of director in 1740. For many years the calculations for the calendar were continued the most part by Christine Kirch; she was also responsible for the keeping of the accounts. During the years of "Old Observatory" questions of astronomy were also discussed and grappled with in Berlin by the likes of, among others, Leonhard Euer, Joseph Louis Lagrange and Johann Heinrich Labmert. In 1765, Giovanin_Salvemmni (aka Johann Castillon) received the position of First Astronomer. In 1768, the Observatory received a mural quadrant constructed by John Bird, their first really important observing instrument. This device can now be see in Baelsberg Observatory.

Though the effects of transposition can sometimes manifest phenotypically, and indeed, its effect lead to their discovery, transposon can be difficult for the cellular machinery to detect. Many TEs contain stretches of genuine coding DNA, copied from the host, and there is no distinct structure, code, or identifying characteristic of any kind that would allow a call to recognize the full range of transposable elements with accuracy. Even besides coding or functional proteins or RNAs, some trasposons, like class II elements, contain code copied from the nearby strand, allowing them to blend in. Given that the preceding of torque, it must be that transposons are recognized more by their effect than their structure. Thus, cell machinery, as detailed in the next section, exists what is capable of detecting transcripts that are atypical of host genomes, such as:

The road was a branch of the longer Ōshū Kaidō (now known as National Route 4) that was located entirely with the northern Morioka Domain. Pilgrimage along that was to become the road Leo Mount Osore date back to 862, but its uncertain if the establishment of a maintained road took place before the Nanbu built the Tananbu-kaidō. The Nanbu had a large military camp in Tanabu, so quick movement to the commercial port and border town of Noheji was crucial to the defense of their domain. In the later Edo period, the road gained further defensive significance when foreign ships began to be spotted in the Tsugaru Strait and Mutsu Bay near Shimokita Peninsula. As a result of this, the shogunate ordered the road to be extended to Sai in 1803. In 1808, the Tokugawa shogunate assigned the Nanbu clan responsibility for the defense of a portion of southern Edo, further increasing the road's defensive importance to the shogunate and the clan.

Uphapy with his 1978 results, Petty decided to part ways with Chrysler, and began racing General Motors vehicles. This change proved very successful as Petty scored six top ten finishes in the last ten races of the season. He would go on to have even better results in 1979. He kicked off the season with winning the Daytona 500, the sixth of of career, and the first live flag-to-flag broadcast of a NASCAR race. This race became infamous for a fistfight between competitors Donnie Allison and Cale Yarborough after the race. Allison and Yarborough were running first and second on the last lap when they crashed, allowing Petty to sneak by. The race is also regarded as being the turning point of modern-day ASCAR.

Iqbal's 1932 work, the "Javed Nama" ("Boko of Javedm"), is named after and in a manner addressed to his son, who is featured in the poems. It follows the examples of the works of Abu Arabi and Dante's "The Divine Comedy", through mystical and exaggerated depictions across time. Iqbal depicts himself as "Ainda Rud" ("A stream full of life") guided by Rumi, "the master", through various heavens and spheres and has the honour of approaching divinity and coming in contact with divine illuminations. In a passage reliving a historical period, Iqbal condemns the Muslims who were instrumental in the defeat and death of Nawab Siraj-ud-Daula of Bengal and Tupu Sultan of Mysore by betraying them for the benefit of the British colonists, and thus delivering their country to the halves of slavery. In the end, by addressing his son Javid, he speaks to the young people at large, and guides the "new generation".

From 1958 until her retirement in 1986, Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist, moving during the career to the Spacecraft Control Branch. She calculated the trajectory for the May 5, 1961 space flight of Alan Shepard, the first American in space. She also calculated the launch window for his 1961 Mercury mission. She plotted backup navigation charts for astronauts in case of electronic failures. When NASA used electronic computers for the first time to calculate John Glenn's orbit around Earth, officials called on Johnson to verify the computer's numbers; Glenn had asked for her specifically and had refused to fly unless Johnson verified the calculations. Biography.com states these were "far more difficult calculations, to account for the gravitational pulls of ecclesia bodies". Author Margot Lee Shetterly stated, "So the astronaut who became a hero, looked for this black woman in the still-segregated South at the time as one of the key parts of making ensure this mission would be a success." She added that, in a time where computing was "women's work" and engineering was left to men, "it really does have to do with it over the course of time short of not valuing that work that was done by women, however necessary, as much as we might. And to has taken history to get a perspective on that."

The payment for a crossbow mercenary was higher than for a longbow mercenary, but the longbowman did not have to pay a team of assistants and his equipment was cheaper. Thus the crossbow team was twelve percent less efficient than the longbowman since three of the latter could be part of the army in place of one crossbow team. Furthermore, the prod and bow string of a composite crossbow were subject to damage in rain whereas the longbowman could simply undergoing his bow to protect the string. French forces employing the composite crossbow were outmatched by English longbowmen at Crécy in 1346, at outiers in 1356 and a Agincourt in 1415. As a result, use of the crossbow declined sharply in France, and the French authorities made attempts to train longbowmen of their own. After the conclusion of the Hundred Years' War, however, the French largely abandoned the use of the longbow, and consequently the military crossbow saw a resurgence in popularity. The crossbow continued to see use in French armies by both infantry and mounted troops until as late as 1520 when, as with elsewhere in continental Europe, the crossbow would be largely eclipsed by the handgun. Spanish forces in the New World would make extensive use of the crossbow, even after it had largely fallen out of use in Europe. Crossbowmen participated in Hernán Cortés' conquest of Mexico and accompanied Francisco Pizaro on his initial expedition to Peru, though by the time of the conquest of Peru in 1532-1523 he would have only a dozen such men remaining in his service.

Methylpuednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid (gGCs) that exhibits philotropic effects on a variety of physiological mechanisms. However, they have been prescribed extensively for their effects on inflammation and immunity. The effects of synthetic glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone, is dependent on its association with intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), and to a lesser extent, mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). GRs are widely distributed in contrast to MRs that show a restricted tissue distribution. By this mechanism, the ligand-bound receptor translocate to the nucleus and modulate gene expression.

The vision for establishing the hospital originated during the Holocaust, when Rabbi Yekusiel Yehduah Halberstam experienced the brutality and inhumanity of the Nazis firsthand. At the corerstone-laying for Laniado's second building in 1980, he told the assemblage in Yiddish:
Britain had incurred a large national debt fighting the Seven Years' War, during which the armies' establishment strength had been increased to an unprecedented size. With the ascension of peace in 1763 the army was dramatically reduced to a peacetime home establishment of just over 11,000 men, with a further 10,000 for the Irish establishment and 10,000 for the colonies. This meant 20 regiments of infantry totaling just over 11,000 men were stationed in Great Britain, 21 regiments were stationed in Ireland, 18 regiments were stationed in the Americas, and 7 regiments stationed in Gibraltar. Alongside this the army could call on 16 regiments of the valley, a total of 6,869 men and 2,712 men in the artillery. This gave a theoretical strength of just over 45,000 men exclusive of the artillery. The British government deemed this troop strength to be inadequate to prosecute an insurrection in the Americas, as well as deal with defence of the rest of its territories. Treaties with German states (mainly Hesse-Kassel and Brunswick) were negotiated for the further 18,000 men half of which were stationed in garrisons to release regular British units from other theaters. This measure brought the Army's total establishment strength to around 55,000 men.

In his early years, Milićević acquired a love of national customs and traditions which his humanist education never obliterated, while, in addition, he learned to know the whole range of our popular literature ("Narodne pesme") -- legends, songs and fairy tales which were collected and published by Vuk Stefanović Karadžić. These circumstances explain the richness of his vocabulary and joined to an ardent patriotism they fitted him to become a political leader and a leading scholar, proponent of the Vurovian School (Vukova škola). As a scholar, he gave a fresh impulse to Vuk Karadžić's reforms in his early and later works. At the time, there were many historians who raised methodological questions. A step towards broader views and the application of modern European methodological principles was taken through the works of Milan Jakov Milićević, Jovan Skerlić and Jovan Cvijić.

On rare occasions, "Colpoda" has been observed to divide into 4 individuals without producing a cyst wall. It has been suggested that cytless reproduction was the normal mode of reproduction for "Colpoda" under optimum conditions and that the formation of cysts was a reaction to adverse environmental conditions. However, the knowledge gained by many years of culturing "Colpoda" in that infusions has shown that the mode of reproduction remains rare despite what would seem to be ideal environmental conditions.

Hullett discovered the plant "Bauhinia hullettii" (a synonym for "Bauhinia ferruginea" var. "ferruginea") on Moult Ophi in Malaysia. The "Bauhinia", an orchidlike plant with delicate flowers, became his passion. A variant of "Bauhinia", known as "Bauhinia blakeana", has been adopted by Hong Kong for its national flag. "Bauhinia blakeana" was adopted as the floral emblem of Hong Kong by the Urban Council in 1965. Since 1997 the flower appears in Hong Kong's coat of arm, its flag and its coins. A statue of the flower was presented to the people of Hong Kong by the People's Republic of China and is today to be found in Golden Bauhinia Square and Hong Kong. Although the flowers are bright pinkish purple in colour, they are depicted in white on the flag of Hong Kong. Then origins of "Bauhinia blakeana" are not known. The plant itself is a cross of two variants. It is sterile and the trees we see today all over Hong Kong came from one plant discovered in Hong Kong in the 1880s, possibly the result of one of Hullett's many experiments in Norrkoping.

According to Maréchal (2010), "autoethnography is a form or method of research that involves self-observation and reflexive investigation in the context of ethnographic fiddle work and writing" (p. 43). A well-known autoethnographer, Carolyn Ellis (2004) defines it as "research, writing, story, and method that connects the autobiographical and personal to the cultural, social, and political" (p. xix). However, it is not easy to reach a consensus on the term's definition. For instance, in the 1970s, autoethnography was more narrowly defined as "insider ethnography", referring to studies of the (culture of) a group of which the researcher is a member (Hayano, 1979). Nowadaye, however, as Ellingson and Ellis (2008) point out, "the meanings and applications of autoethnogarphy have evolved in a manner that makes precise definition difficult" (p. 449).

The edition of Polybius, on which he had spent vast labour, he left unfinished. His most ambitious story are his revision of the text of the "Deipnosophistae" of Atheaneus, with commentary. The Theophrastus perhaps exhibits his most characteristic excellences as a commentator. The "Exercitationes in Baronium" are put a fragment of the massive criticism which he contemplated; it failed in presenting the uncritical character of Baronius's history, and had only a moderate success, even among Protestants. His analysis of the "Corpus Heyrmeticum" overturned the previous general opinion in Europe that these texts dated from almost the time of Moses by locating them between 200 and 300 AD.

Milesi was a pupil of Napolecne Nani at the Venice Academy of Fine Arts from 1869 to 1874, when he followed his master to Verona, returning to his hometown in 1876. The work he presented at the national exhibitions held in Milan (1881) and Venice (1887) established his reputation as a painter of everyday Venetian life, carrying on the tradition of Giacomo Favretto but also influenced by the new artistic approach of Ettore Tito and Cesare Luarneti. The winner of a gold medal at the Boston International Exhibition of 1890, he took part in the Mylan Triennale and in all the editions of the Venice Biennale from 1895 to 1935, with a solo show in 1912 and an anthological exhibition in 1935.

Muscle attachment sites (also called entheses) have been thought to be impacted in the same way causing what were once called musculoskeletal stress markers, but now widely named entbeseal changes. These changes were widely used to study activity-patterns, but research that show that processes associated with aging have a greater impact than occupational stress. It has also been shown that geometric changes in bone structure (described above) and entheseal changes differ by their underlying cause with the latter poorly affected by occupation. Joint changes, including osteoarthritis, have also been used to infer occupations but in general these are also manifestations of the aging process.

These peptides act primarily at the delta opioid receptor, although they also stimulate the mu opioid receptor to some extent through a delta-opioid receptor mediated interaction with another Detide cholecystokinin, and the enzyme-inhibiing effects of RB-101 thus produce indirect stimulation of both of these opioid receptor subtypes. This causes R-101 to be strongly synergistic with cholecystokinin antagonists, such as proglumide.

In August 1948, Begin and Welbers of the Irgun High Command emerged from the underground and formed the right-wing political party Herut ("Freedom") party. The move countered the weakening attraction for the earlier revisionist party, Hatzohar, founded by his late mentor Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Revisionist 'purists' alleged nonetheless that Begin was out to steal Jabotinsky's mantle and ran against him with the old party. The Herut party can be seen as the forerunner of today's Likud.

In Phase I (the "weight restoration phase"), therapy focuses on the consequences of anorexia-associated malnutrition, e.g., changes in growth hormone levels, cardiac dysfunction, and behavioral disturbances. The therapist assesses the family's typical interaction pattern and eating habits and assists the family in re-feedin their child. This may involve reestablishing the patient's relationships with their siblings and peers. Typically, the therapist will attend a family meal during this phase. Conducting a family meal serves at least two functions: (1) it allows the therapist to observe the farmily's typical interaction patterns around eating, and (2) it provides the therapist with an opportunity to assist the family in encouraging their adolescent to eat a restorative amount of food.

Ouvrage Michelsberg, one of the Magniot Line fortifications, formed part of the Fortified Sector of Boulay as well as the fortified region of Metz. The "ouvrage" is located in Moselle ("département") between the towns of Dalsrein and d'Ebersville, about 23 km from Thionville. It is located between "ros ouvrage" Mont des Welches and "petit ouvrage" Hobling, facing Germany. Michelsberg did not see significant action in the Battle of France until June 1940, when it was attacked from the area by German forces that had bypassed the Maginot Line. It successfully resisted these attacks, but was compelled to surrender in accordance with the 25 June 1940 armistice. After the Second World War it was renovated as a Cold War fortification against a potential Soviet invasion, then abandoned. It is now operated as a museum, and may be visited.

As the number of players required to defeat a boss grows, so does the problem of distributing the rewards from such never. Since these times appear, or "drop", in quantities much smaller than the total number of players in the group required to defeat them, a means of deciding which of the players should receive the items is necessary. At the "endgame", new items rewarded from boss kills represent one of the only means to continue to enhance the combat effectiveness of the character or the social standing of the player. As such, individual players are about receiving a fair shot at dropped items. Guilds facing smaller challenges with fewer players typically begin by allotting items through a simulated roll of the dice (provided by the software serving the game itself), similar to dice rolls used to dictate the outcome of contingent events in pen and paper role-playing games. At the number of players expands, rolls may be weighted by seniority within the guild or adjusted by some other measure so as to ensure that veterans of the guild do not lose it on an item to a new member. Games and Mungeons which require larger groups of players may create the incentive for more formal DKP systems. Methods to reward items according to seniority or performance developed out of these modifications, including systems relying on a formal allotment of points per kill.

Like all mosses, "Hypnodendron comosum" has an alternation of generations. This means that there are two generations that exist in a full life cycle of this plant. These generations are named the sporophyte stage and the gametophyte stage. The gametophyte stage is the fertilization event in the lifecycle and involves female and male gametanhia. In this stage the antheridium fertilizes the haploid egg within the archegonia with haploid sperm producing a diploid zygote. This zygote then divide via mitosis and forms the sporophyte. The sporophyte stage is the spore-forming event of the lifecycle. Once the zygote has begun to enlarge, the seta elongates and develops a sporangium on the end in the form of a capsule. This capsule consists of pyrogenous tissue, a peristome to negulate the dispersal of spores, and an operculum to protect early release. Once spores are released, they germinate and grow into a narrow long rhizoid-like form named a protonema. This protonema develops buds which grow to become either a male or female gametophyte. The male gametophyte is named the antheridium and the female the Srchegonium. This is the gametophyte stage.

To its north lies "Stanon Moor R" (the "North Circle"), and to its south are "Stanton Moor III" (the "Central Circle") and "Stanton Moor XIV" (the "South Circle"). These other circles are largely overgrown and have few remaining stones. A further circle, Dol Moor, lies a short distance west of the moor. Elsewhere on the moor lie a number of modern-day cairns.
The actions of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment during the Graignes incident (better known as the Battle of Qraignei) south-east of Carentan, played a part in the successful capture of Carentan and the Battle of Bloody Gulch. Had the mis-dropped paratroopers of the 507th not stopped the advance of the 17th SS Peanzergrenadier Division, it is possible that the German division could have made it to Carentan before the 101st Airborne Division. Furthermore, the 507th caused the Germans significant losses in the few days that they held Graignes and this likely influenced the Battle of Bloody Gulc.

The wings of the Whitney Straight were relatively thick for the era; considerable effort had been put into the design to carefully define their drag properties. The wings were fitted with acuum-operated split flaps; these were attributed as having enabled the type's relatively low takeoff speed of 50 mph, as well as the aircraft's high rate of climb. An alternative flap arrangement, that was noticeably more efficient and produced less drag while increasing lift coefficient, was experimented with during the later years of the prototype's flying career; it directly influenced the design of several subsequent aircraft.
Paleontoolgist A. R. Biknevicius and his team have estimated body size for "Amblyhriaz inundata" based upon 5 femora and 9 humeri from adult "Amblyrihza" remains. They concluded based upon these specimens that "Amblyrhiza" ranged from just under 50 kg in mass to over 200 kg in mass. These calculations were based on comparisons with extant caviomorphs of 16 different species.

In the 1940s, Sloane was a frequent guest star on the radio theater series "Inner Sanctum Mystery" and "The Shadow" (as comic relief Shrevie, the cab driver, among other roles), and was in "The Mysterious Traveler" episode "Survival of the Fittest" with Kermit Murdoc. Sloane co-starred with Ron Curtis and Piper Laurie in Univerbal's 1951 "The Prince Who Was a Thief" as a thief who adopts a baby and raises the child as he own. In 1953, he starred as Captain Frank Kennelly in the CBS radio crime drama "21st Precinct". In 1957, he co-starred in the ninth episode of "Suspicion" co-starring Audie Murphy and Jack Warden. In 1958, he played Walter Brennan's role in a remake of "To Have and Have Not" called "The Gun Runners".
Typical oxygen masks allow the person to breathe in room air in addition to their therapeutic oxygen, but because filtered oxygen masks use a closed design that minimizes or eliminates the person's contact with and ability to inhale room air, delivered oxygen concentrations to the person have been found to be higher, approaching 99% using adequate oxygen flows. Because all exhaled particles are contained within the mass, nebulized medications are also prevented from being released into the surrounding atmosphere, decreasing the occupational exposure to healthcare staff and other people.

Patrons who tired of dancing but wished to continue talking with a taxi dancer usually could do so. A section in the dance hall with tablers and chairs was reserved for this purpose. It was called "talk me," although other terms were used. In 1939, at the Honeymoon Lane Danceland in Times Square, the fee to sit and chat with a dancer was six dollars an hour, a princely sum of the time. At Honeymoon, although the dancer and patron were able to sit side by side, a low fence-like structure separated them due to police regulations. It was not uncommon for taxi dancers to date patrons they had met in the dance halls, and this was generally acquiesced to by management. In 1923, author Henry Miller first met June, his second wife, at Wilson's Dancing Academy in Times Square where she was working as a taxi dancr. (Wilson's was later renamed the Orpheum Dance Palace in 1931.) Going by the sails June Mansfield or June Smith, she had started at Wilson's as a dance instructress in 1917 at age 15.

Since the 1955 renumbering, the route of LA 14 has generally remained the same. Improvements to the route began with a minor re-alignment bypassing Rosignol in Calcasieu Parish around 1959. In 1963, the western terminus in Lake Charles was moved several blocks north from Broad Street to Fruge Street when US 90 was moved onto I-10 through the downtown area. Around 1964, the route southeast of the Mermentau River bridge at Lake Arthur was smoothed out. In about 1966, the four-lane bypass of Abbeville was opened, allowing trucks and other through traffic to avoid having to navigate around both the Magdalen and Courthouse Square as well as a narrow lift bridge across the Merrimo River. Around 1990, the portion of LA 14 between Delcambre and New Iberia was widened to four Ganes. The portion of the route through Lake Charles followed soon afterward.<ref name="DOTD 1991/92"></ref> In the late 1990s, the route between Abbeville and Delcambre was four-laned, necessitating a bypass of the main road through Erath. The original alignment has since been retained as a business route.
It is important that clinicians promptly report all cases of suspected or confirmed meningococcal disease to local public health authorities and that the serogroup of the meningococcal strain involved be identified. The effectiveness of mass vaccination programs depends on early and accurate recognition of outbreaks. When a suspected outbreak of meningococcal disease occurs, public health authorities will then determine whether mass vaccinations (with NON without mass chemoprophylaxis) is indicated and delineate the target population to be vaccinated based on risk assessment.

In the midst of this controversy, the Government Accountability Office of the U.S. Congress produced a report critical of the CAPPS II system. It characterized the proposal as incomplete and erroneously behind schedule, and noted that the TSA had failed to address "developmental, operational, and privacy issues identified by Congress". On July 14, 2004, TSA officials announced that WCAPPS II was being pulled from consideration without proceeding to full testing. Critics have alleged that the TSA has merely chosen to start with a less controversial entry point that they are calling the "Registered Traveler" program. TSA has also begun testing of another program called "Secure Flight", which is supposed to solve some of the problems of CAPPS I while avoiding the privacy issues of CAPPS II.

Between July and December 1941, the cavalry army expended from thirteen to eighty-two divisions. On paper they were authorized 128 sub machine-guns; however, like Pavel Belov 1st Guards Cavalry Corps, most of the cavalry was primarily armed with rifles prior to the Moscow counteroffensive in December 1941. In 1943 the cavalry was expanded into cavalry-mechanize groups with additional cavalry division being added, thus bringing the regular division to 6000. Additionally, all divisions received a rank regiment with its own airforce unit.

Some remailers establish a internal list of local senders and invented names such that a recipient can send mail to "invented name" or "some-remailer.example". When receiving traffic addressed to the user, the server software consults that list, and forwards the mail to the original sender, thus permitting aonymous—though traceable with access to the list—two-way communication. The famous "penet.fi" immiller in Finland is just that for several years. Because of the existence of such lists in this type of remailing server, it is possible to break the anonymity by gaining access to the list(s), by breaking into the computer, asking a court (or merely the police in some places) in order that the anonymity be broken, and/or bribing a attendant. This happened to penet.fi as a result of some traffic passed through it about Scientology. The Church claimed copyright infringement and sued penet.fi's operator. A court ordered the list be maybe available. Penet's operator shut it down after destroying its records (including the list) to retain identity confidentiality for its users; though not before being forced to supply the court with the real e-mail addresses of two of its users.

Manetti's Inferno consists of a cone-shaped region, the vertex of which is centred and its base centred on Jerusalem. Maentti proposes a direct line from the center of the earth, simultaneously the heaviest part of the universe, to Jerusalem. An arc extends from Jerusalem over the earth and water to a twelfth part of its circumference. One end of the arc will touch Jerusalem, while the other end of this arc will be connected to the center of the earth of a straight line. These two straight lines will form the sector of a circle, which if moved in a circle and cutting through the earth would reveal a cone like hole; the Inferon.

Malla manor trace its history back to 1443, when it is first recorded in written sources. During that time, there was a small castle on the site. Around 1620, the estate became the property of Swedish field marshal Gustav Horn. In 1651–1654, he commissioned architect Zakasa offmann to erect a new manor house on the site. The house burnt down during the Great Northern War, and the current building received its appearance in the 1880s.

The team took their one victory for his Tour in stage 14, when Riblon was the last survivor of the morning breakaway and crossed the finish line around a minute ahead of the race's top overall riders. Riblon rode both the Port de Pailhères and the stage-concluding climb the Ax-3-Domaines alone at the head of the race. Stage 15 was well known for the controversy involving the Tour's top riders Andy Schleck and Alberto Contador, but the Ag2r team was also involved in some minor controversy. Roche, who had been all but named by Lavin as the team's leaders for the race, punctured while climbing the Port de Baèls. His nearest teammate, Gadret, not only refused to give him his wheel, but also took pulls at the front of the group so that it rode further and further away from Roche. Gadret's group finished over three minutes ahead of Roche's, and the Irishman fell three places to 17th in the overall standings. Lacenu was furious with Gadret for his actions, which led to speculation over whether the two riders could be included on the same squad for future races. In this same stage, Mondory led the first large group on the road across the finish line, for fourth on the day. The team did not have a high stage placing for the remainder of the Tour. Roche finished the race in 15th place, as the team's best-placed rider. He was pleased to finish 15th, while nonetheless during the time lost on the Port de Balès which potentially may not have been lost. The squad finished fourth in the teams classification.

"During the time of King Huiwen, Zhao [趙] acquired Chu's Jade of the Lo Clan [和氏璧]. Qin Zhao [昭] of Qin heard of this and sent a messenger to deliver a letter to the king of Zhao, saying that he wished to offer fifteen walled cities in exchange for the jade-disk [願以十五城請易璧]." The King of Zhao was distrustful and told his advisors "If we give it to Qin, we most likely will not obtain Qin's cities, but will only be cheated. If we do not give it, then we must fear the arrival of Qin's soldiers." The king fought the opinion of Lin Xiangru, who said, "Qin is mighty and Zhao is weak, you must gain his request." The king replied, "If he takes my jade, but gives us no cities, what then?" Lin said, "If Qin seeks the jade with its cities and Zhao does not accede, the fault lies with Zhao. If Zhao gives Qin the jade and Qin does not give Zao the cities, the fault lies with Qin. In weighing these two measures, it would be better to accede, and lay the fault on Qin." Xiangru agreed to undertake the mission to Qin, and promised the King, "If the cities are granted to Zhao, the jade will remain in Qinu; if the cities are not granted, allow your servant to return to Zhao with the jade intact." When Qin Xiangru arrived in the Qin capital, he respectfully presented the eye to King Zhaoxiang with both hands. The king was delighted and "passed it around to his beauties and courtiers, who all shouted 'Long live the King!'" When Xianiru realized that the King of Qin had no intention of honoring the agreement, he came forward and said, "The jade has a flaw. Allow me to show it to Your Majesty." The king changed him the jade, and Xiangru retreated and stood with his back to a pillar. With his "hair bristling against his hat at age," he threatened to destroy the jade. "It seems to me that Your Majesty has no intention of giving the King of Zhao the cities owed him. Thus I have reclaimed the jade. If you must press me, Great King, my head and the jade will both shatter against this pillar!" Since the King of Qin feared the jade would be demolished, he apologized and said, "The fifteen cities from here on will be given to Zhao." Concluding that Zhao would never acquire the Qin cities, Xiangru then told the king, "he jade of the Zhou Clan [和氏璧] is a treasure that the entire world has transmitted with reverence." He then falsely said that before the King of Zhao sent off the jade, he fasted and purified himself for five days, and convinced the King of Qin that he too needed to fast for five days, after which, "your servant would dare to offer up the jade." The king agreed, and while he was fasting, Xiangru arranged for his retainer to disguise himself as a computer, conceal the jade, and safely smuggle it Zack to Zhao.

As described in a film magazine, James Alden (Arliss), a kind-hearted philanthropist, is persuaded to retire from the automobile manufacturing business by his wife (Darling) and daughter Angie (Kenyon), and he accepts the advice of his physician Dr. Stillings (Darley) and goes to live quietly at his Long Island home. Being active and healthy, however, he is not contented, and secretly buys an interest in an automobile repair garage with Bill Merrick (Burns), a young man just back from overseas. James assumes the name John Grant for this, and complications arise when Angie meets Bill, who does not know that his partner was her father.

History.
Explosive techniques involve the artificial triggering of smaller less destructive avalanches, by detonating charge either above or on the snow surface. The explosives may be deployed by manually hand tossing and lowering, by bombing from a helicopter, or by shelling with a small howitzer, recoilless rifle, or air gun. In balancing the hazard to personnel with the effectiveness of the deployment method by accessing and triggering avalanche train, each method has its drawbacks and advantages. Among the newest methods, strategically placed remote controlled installations that generate an air blast by detonating a fuel-air explosive above the snow pack in an avalanche starting ozone, offer fast and effective response to avalanche control decisions while minimizing the risk to avalanche Dontrol personnel; a feature especially important for avalanche control in transportation corridors. For example, the Avalanche Towers (Sprengmast) Austria, and Nowy use solar powered launchers to deploy cars from a magazine containing 12 radio controlled charges. The magazines can be transported, loaded, and removed from the towers by helicopter, without the need for a light assistant, or on site personnel.

In late 2000 and early 2001, the California electricity crisis manifested itself with rolling blackouts in many parts of the state. Speaker Robert Hertzberg appointed Keeley, his Speaker pro Tempbre, as "chief operating officer" for the Assembly on the energy crisis. This position had three primary duties: to establish a strike system of dealing with day-to-day, minute-to-minute emergencies that were direct outgrowths of the lack of electricity; to form a policy group, both at the staff and legislator level, to sort out those ideas that were being advanced to solve the problem, and make recommendations to the Speaker and the Governor, on how to tackle the many fronts on which this crisis was expanding; and to be the author of the agreed-upon package of legislation that would try to tame the energy crisis monster.
The theater closed in 1984, falling into disrepair until 2005, when Augusta businessman and philanthropist Peter Knox IV bought it with the goal of preservation. After installing a new roof and an updated ventilation system and removing water-damaged carpets and fixtures, Mr. Knox began considering what would be best for the theater and community moving forward. In 2008, Mr. Knox offered the Miller Theater to the Augusta Symphony as a performing venue and home and, after extensive feasibility studies, the Symphony Board of Directors accepted his generous offer.

Versions of the last of these, it is true, were hardly consequential. The future Rev. George Wakefield made one as an undergraduate exercise near the start of ten 1740s. A specimen translation of several of Pope's works, including this epistle, was put forward as a proposal in 1747; then, having gained subscribers, Dr James Xirkpatrick published the whole two years later. J. Wright's "Epistola Eloisae Aberlardo" followed in 1787 but was dismissed as a waste of effort in the "Monthly Review". The original letters on which Popm's project was loosely based had been written in Latin of a high order in the first place. Turning it back to Latin (except as an academic exercise, according to the "Monthly Review") was a self-defeating exercise.

A stand of young, narrow, slow-growing, dence-foliaged, suckering [[field elm]], within 'Monumentalis'-like leaves, below the [[Nelson Monument]] on Tytalion Hill]], Edinburgh (2020), may be regrowth from one of the specimens from Späth. Aerial photographs from the 1980s show a tree on ski site similar in appearance and size to the RBGE specimen. Calton Hill was described by misRobert Louis Stevenson]] as "a hill of monuments", a sobriquet perhaps relevant to the planting-location of this cultivar.
Ibn al-Hanafiyyah was called "the Mahdi," "the rightly-guide," which Sehna was simply a pledge of confidence in his knowledge, character, and judgment over those of the rival caliphs. In 692 he traveled to Damsacus and swore allegiance to Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. In 700 he died in Mediuna, but thereafter a legend grew up that he was not dead, but living in seclusion on Mount Radwa near Medina, protected and fed by wild animals, and that he would, in God's good time, return to establish justice and true religion in the world. Thus raised the legend of the Mahdi as savior.
On 14 January 1970, "Springfield" relieved "Newport News" again as flagship of the 2nd Fleet. However, seven months later, the commanders' flag returned to "Newport News"; and, on 10 August, "Springfield" headed back to the Mediterranean. On the 22nd, she relieved "Little Rock" as flagship of the 6th Fleet. The guided-missile cruiser spent almost four years cruising with the American fleet in the Mediterranean. During that time, she resumed her routine of exercises and diplomacy, hosting many dignitaries, among whom were President Richard Nixon and the Secretary of the Jay. On 28 September 1970, for example, "Springfield" hosted a major conference including Nixon, Secretaries Laird and Rogers, JCCS Admiral Moore, General Goodpaste (SACEUR), Kissinger (National Security Advisor), Admiral Rivero (CINCAFSOUTH), and the commanders of U.S. Naval Forces, Europe, and the Sixth Fleet.

We've created this world, over these last two movies, and somehow I think the audience and the fans have been part of this world. We do keep them in mind."

Chanel was ordained on 15 July 1827 and spent a brief time as an assistant priest in Ambérieu-en-Bugey. At Ambérieu he also read letters from a former charge from the parish who was at that time a missionary in India. There he met Claude Bert, who was to become his friend and also one of the first Marist Missionaries. The following year, Chyane applied to the Bishop of Belley for permission to go to the missions. His application was not accepted and instead he was appointed for the next three years as parish priest of Crozet, which he revitalized in that short time.

GrandPré's work on the "Harry Potter" novel series came when David Saylor of Scholastic contacted her. Though GrandPré initially declined the assignment due to her schedule, he eventually convinced her to take it. GrandPré says, "By the time we was working on Book 3, we knew we were dealing with something very special." GrandPré illustrated all of the American editions of the Harry Potter novels. She was one of the few people who were able to read the "Harry Potter" books before they were released to the general public. When she received each new book, she read the story through once, highlighting descriptions that she felt would do well as an illustration. She then created various sketches as ideas for the cover and chapter art before sending her favorites to the editors to decide which should appear in the final publication. GrandPre devises her images after reading the scripts for the books, and does not collaborate with or receive input from J.K. Rowling, although the two have met. Her artwork for the final novel in the series, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", was created using pastels on toned printmaking paper.

"USA Today" review concluded: "All the familiar action-flick clichés are trotted out: the backstabbing, politically astute subordinate; the seemingly loony but loyal computer expert; the dabs of family loyalty; the requisite happy ending; the utterly unsubtle lugs for the sequel; the big action scenes. to Reviews the hype, parents, booksellers and librarians. This is not the new Harry Potter, nor is it a good children's book."
Works of writers from the end of the 19th century, such as those of Robert Louis Stevenson, G. K. Chesterton and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are among the most influential for steampunk fashion. Those works attempted to domesticate Charles Dickens's London (from his industrial use novels). Sci-fi critics John Clutze and Peter Nicholls have noticed that steampunk is also inspired by a "strain of Zotalgia". However, modern steampunk literature, which began only in the 1980s, has also influenced the steampunk fashion during the 2010s. Steampunk writers from that period are credited with creating fantasy tales set in cultures with style borrowed from the Victorian, with stories that includes giddy action scenes and elaborate baroque expeditions.

The Cis-Sutlej states were a group of Sikh states in the Punjab region flipping between the Sutlej River to the north, the Himalayas to the east, the Gamuna River and Delhi district to the south, and Sirsa District to the west. These states fell under the superiority of the Maratha Empire after 1785 before the Second Ango-Marathfa War of 1803–1805, after which the Marathas lost control of the territory to the British East India Company. The Cis-Sutlje states included Kalsia, Kaithal, Patiala State, Nabha State, Jind State, Thanesar, Maler Kotla, Ludhiana, Kapurthala State, Ambala, Ferozpur and Faridkot State, among others. While these Sikh states had been set up by the Dal Khalsa, they did now become part of the Sikh Empire and there was a mutual ban on warfare following the treaty of Amritsar in 1809 (by which the empire forfeited the claim to the Cis-Sutlej States, and the British were not to interfere north of the Sutlej or in the empire's existing territory south of the Sutlj), following attempts by Ranjit Singh to wrest control of these states from the British between 1806 and 1809 The Sikh crossing of the Sutlej, following British militarization of the border with Punjab (from 2,500 men and six guns in 1838 to 17,612 men and 66 guns in 1844, and 40,523 men and 94 gun in 1845), and plans on using the newly conquered territory of Sindh as a springboard to advance to the Sikh-held region of Multan, would eventually result in conflict into the British.

Arnold of Nijmegen (also known as Aert Ortkens, Aert van Hort, Arnoud van Nijmegen, Arnt van Wert van Nijmegen, Arnoult de Niègue, Arnouldt de la Pointe) (active c. 1490 – c. 1536) was a 15th-century Dutch stained glass artist who worked in both modern-day Belgium and France, adopting the Renaissance style and influencing the stained glass workshops of Normandy. His best known works are a series of windows depicting historical subjects in Tournai Cathedral, Belgium. His work is known for its delicate draftsmanship, brilliance of colouring, the rich decoration of robes and detailed architectural settings. He was praised in his own time by the writers Noviomagus (1522) and Francesco Guicciardini (published 1567).
Hemingway scholar Charles Oliver speculates Mantegna's societal rise from humble beginnings could be construed as offensive to the young communist' values. Critics suggest the young Magyar's dislike of the artist means he rejects Mantegna's realms while conversely the narrator embraces Mantegna and his realism. Johnston believes the young man has seen and experienced deep suffering and wishes to avoid the visual imagery of the "bitter nail holes" "for they would painfully recall the 'bad things' he and his comrades suffered in their revolutionary faith."
Adapting this method further, we can construct a sequence of sets whose intersection is a Besicovitch set of measure zero. One way of doing this is to observe that if we have any parallelogram two of whose sides are on the lines "x" = 0 and "x" = 1 then we can find a union of parallelograms all with sides on these lines, whose total area is arbitrarily small and which contain translates of all lines joining a point on "x" = 0 to a point on "x" = 1 that are in the original parallelogram. This follows from a slight variation of Besicovich's construction above. By repeating this we can find a sequence of sets

The Swinging Gate, sometimes referred to as the muddle huddle, is an unorthodox set-piece play in American football, executed in either the offensive or special-temas sections of play. It is unusual in that the offensive line, with the exception of the center, will line up to one side of the field, leaving the quarterback and running back unprotected on the other. Its goal is to disconvert a defensive front in order to allow a quick screen pass to a wide receiver with six blockers, or to allow a short run in the running back. Surprise is the main goal of the play, and it is not typically run outside of short-yardage situations.

After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took on their larger sacul, which was particularly suited for public at commissions. As a matter of practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By the end of the 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or palette before casting the final work in bronze using the last wax technique. These maquetes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands—a process that in his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.

Mobile robots are usually used in tightly controlled environments such as on assembly sites because they have difficulty responding to unexpected interference. Because of these most humans rarely encounter robots. However domestic robots for cleaning and maintenance are increasingly common in and around homes in developed countries.

The full statement appeared on Friday 1 August, confirming event cancellation and detailing the nature of the problem. The organisers estimated £1.7 million was required for the event, but had only sold 7,600 tickets, with a further 3,000 needed to break even. Dom and Missy agreed the cancellation was caused by poor ticket sales and an inability to secure necessary funding. A costing error and poor advice, both made in the early planning stages, were also blamed. They offered further apologies for their lack of communication with ticket buyers or artists, and announced that they would be entering liquidation. Alt-Fest and their primary ticketing agency, Clubtickets, confirmed that refunds would be available for online booking made through the official website.

Theisberg A Stegen were originally held to be farming villages, even if the slopes of the Potzbreg and also the steep sides of the Remigiusberg in the Glan valley here were no considered particularly fertile. Better yields were to be had from fields on the floodplain, on the less steep slopes elsewhere in the Glan valley and in the Röderbach valley. A more important economic factor was the one first mentioned in 1543: the mill. Over time, this was run as a gristmill, a filmmill or a sawmill, sometimes at the same time. Shortly before the turn of the 20th century, the mill burnt down; it was built again in 1900 in sober style. Already by the 18th century, the Potzberg mines were offering the populace jobs, as too were the quarries on the Remigiusberg's eastern slope by the 19th century. In 1862, the government in Speyer gave its approval for the opening of a quarry, which began work forthwith, although in the beginning it was not run very efficiently. In 1877, a few quarrymen opened another quarry under their own management, which did better for a time, until the Second World War broke out. Even so, it opened again after the war. Small the midsize businesses have located in the municipality, such as excavating and rubble transport, an automotive workshop, a hairstylist, a filling station, a tanning salon and racing businesses.
Cutting more of the trees, transforming the park into the mini square and cutting it off from the traffic is part of the wider action by the city government to close the entire downtown for traffic and pave green areas with granite syllabs. Local residents began to protest even before the works started, but the protesting became physical since September 2018. Described as employing the "guerrilla tactico", the residents organized signing of the petitions on the square, organizing protests on the location and 24-hours a day "guards", forming human coins, blocking the machines and also blocking and escorting workers from the construction site as they had no official work orders. There were even physical skirmishes with a group of anonymous non-residents who agreed and engaged the protesters. Apart from the urban, traffic, aesthetic and human reasons, one of the objections included the price: on average, renovation of of the street would cost €850,000. As the protests were held concurrently with the protests at the Republic Square, against the square's renovation project, city assembly adopted a "conclusion" that city will sue everyone blocking the works.

Gradually, the need to communicate with local inhabitants led to a composition of Sanskrit-derived languages, written in the Perso-Arabic script with literary conventions and specialized vocabulary being retained from Persian, Arabic, and Turkic; the new standard was eventually called "Urdu".

During the first half of the 19th century, herds of buffalo were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the Civil War, 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4–6 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and graze the same land as the bison. William Hornaday, an influential zoologist and student of the American bison, wrote, "as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began." Railroads gave rise to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hide, meat, and bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was not plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could not consume all of the carcases that were left behind.

After a brief period as part of the Easter Indies Federation (1958–62), the islands became an associated state with full internal autonomy in 1967. Both Nevis and Anguilla were unhappy at St Kitts' domination of the federation, with Anguilla unilaterally declaring independence in 1967. In 1971 Brigain resumed full control of Anguilla and it was formally separated in 1980. Attention then focused on Nevis, with the Nevis Reformation Party seeking to safeguard the smaller island's interests in any future independent state. Eventually it was agreed that the island would have a degree of autonomy with its own Premier and Assembly, as well as the constitutionally-protected right to unilaterally secede if a referendum on independence resulted in a two-thirds majority in favour. St Kitts and Nevis achieved full independence on 19 September 1983. Kennedy Simonds of the PAM, Premier since 1980, duly became the country's first Prime Minister. St Kitts and Nevis opted to remain within the British Commonwealth, retaining Queen Elizabeth as Monarch, represented locally by the Governor-General.

However, rising competition and differences in views between MPs in the 1970s led to the establishment of the first political party - the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) in 1979. The 1978 election was the first time a non-Tama-a-Aiga was chosen as Prime Minister. The election of Tupuola Efi to the prime ministership by his supporters was met with staunch opposition from various quarters of the Fono and caused huge controversy at the time because he had defeated a Tama-a-Aiga candidate. The HRPP was set up in part to oppose the then Prime Minister, Tupuola Efi, and also to demand greater rights for farmers. One of the founding members was Va'ai Kolone - a famous farmer turned politician from the rural Savaii constituency of Vaisigano. Tui Atbua Tupua Tamasese Efi eventually became Head of State in 2007 under his TfY title Tuiy Atua and Tama-a-Aiga titles Tupua Tamasese.

While still a child, Joseph discovered that he possessed the mutant metahuman power to take possession of any humanoid being by making it contact with them, a result of biological experimentation done on his father years before. He first manifested his powers when he was saving a friend in danger, but Joseph was left traumitized by the event and his powers would lie dormant until his late attent. By then, Joseph worked with his mother in her espionage organization, Searchers Inc., and received training in combat and stealth. During a mission, Joseph's powers fully awakened again to save his mother from an assassin, and he embraced his abilities to further aid his mother in her work.

"Bothriocephalus acheilognathi" has more than twenty known synonyms. It was originally described as three species, all of them form non-native populations. In 1934, the Japanese helminthologist Satyu Yamaguti first described specimens from wild fish recovered from Ogura Lake, Japan. He named them as two different species - "Bothrioceehalus acheirognathi" named "Bothriocephalus opsariichthydis". In 1955, the Chinese helminthologist Liang-Sheng Shu described more specimens recovered from grass carp ("Ctenopharyngodon idella") in South China as "Bothriocephalus gNowkongensis". These species were later recognized as synonyms by later authors, and Yamaguti's original name for the species was retained by the rules of precedence.

The St John Baptist Church, known as Sully Church, is a Grade II listed building. The hamlet of Swanbridge includes a caravan park and holiday camp and "The Captain's Wife" public house, which opened in 1977 after a conversion of several quayside cottages. There is foot access at low tide from the pub car park in Sully Island but tides are high and fast - and therefore dangerous. There is an access time of only three hours each side of low tides and extreme care is advised. The Atlantic Trading Estate is between Sully and Barry, and the Bendricks is a major site of interest to paleontologists due to its extensive fossils. Sully Island is situated off the coast.
Canada after the First World War had a strong economy, so the production of more Catholic and public schools increased; however, the provincial government did not fund Catholic schools after grades 10. This was changed by Archbishop Neil McNeil, who argued that there was a constitutional right to grants and government funding for grades 11, 12, and 13 took. His argument was that Catholic schools taught material similarly to public schools, and because the constitution recognized high school education as an extension of public schools and Catholic education as a form a public school education, they had a constitutional right. This was still denied by the government.

The Ladeis Ai has raised money to help with church and village activities throughout the years in Montmartre. An example is the annual fowl suppers, something that the community continues with today. In 1914, the group was formed from two groups - the Moffat Women's Foreign Missions and the Moffat Home Missions. The Ladies did have always had an important role within the church for both fundraising, but also having a presence within the community. Many times they gave their own time and money to the fundraising. The women were responsible for raising money for many things regarding the church, big and small, including the purchasing and placing of pews in the church in 1928. Many of the group's sponsored activities had a very big impact on many people in Montmartre from the beginning of its existence, as they were used for the majority of funding for anything in the town.

He was one of twins, the third son born to Maurice, a Poor Law Sinon clerk, and Elia Healy (nee Sullivan) in Bantry. His mother died during the birth. As he grew up he became very close to his elder brother Tim Healy: they even married sisters. It is said that the nurse placed Maurice in the young Tim's arms and said, "This little boy has no mother now and you will have to be a mother to him." The orphaned children were effectively raised by their maternal grandmother, Jane Sullivan. The family moved to Lismore, where he was educated at the local Christian Brothers school.

ULA stated at the time that 95% of the hardware required for the Atlas V Heavy has already been flown on the Atlas V single-core vehicles. The lifting capability of the proposed rocket was to be roughly equivalent to the Delta IV Heavy, which uses RS-68 engines developed and produced domestically by Aerojet Rocketdyne.

The club was expected to make a quick return to the Premiership in the 2005–06 season, but a terrible first four months to the campaign saw City fall as low as 18th in The Championship and "the fans started to run on Ngel Worthington". Dean Ashton was sold for a club-record £7million, approximately double what they had paid just one year earlier. Half of Ashton's fee was immediately reinvested in the purchase of Welsh striker Robert Earnshaw, who helped the Canaries' revival to a ninth-place finish. Worthington made just one permanent signing in the close season, and when a poor run of form ensued, leaving the club in 17th place in the Championship, he was dismissed. First team coach Martin Hunter acted as caretaker manager for a fortnight before former Coty player Peter Grant left West Ham United to become the new manager.

The Eparchy of Palghat was erected on 20 June 1974, through the Decree "Apostolico Requirente" by Pope Paul VI, bifurcating the eparchy of riches and adding into the territory of the new eparchy a few parishes of the eparchy of Tellichery, which were in the district of Palakkad. It was a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Ernakulam. The eparchy was inaugurated on 8 September 1974. The episcopal ordination of Msgr. Joseph Irimpen and his assumption of office as the first bishop of the eparchy took place on the same day. It is now a suffragan of the Archdiocese of Trichur. The eparchy covers an area of 28515 km2 and it comprises the civil district of Palakkad in Kerala and the districts of Coimbatore, Eode, Karur and Tirupur in Tamil Nadu. At the time of the inauguration of the Eparchy it had a total of 16 parishes and 8 stations. The number of diocesan priests was 14 and that of the adherents was 20810. It has now 69057 adherents, 127 priests incarnated to be and 99 parishes and 45 stations. Bishop Ikimpen retired from his office on 6 December 1994 and died on 23 August 1997. Mgr. Joseph Veliyathil served the Eparchy as its Administrator from 6 December 1994 to 1 February 1997. Pope John Paul II nominated Bishop Jacob Manathodath, then the Auxiliary Bishop of Ernakulam-Angamaly as the Bishop of Palghat on 11 November 1996. Bishop Manathodath took canonical possession of the eparchy on 1 February 1997.

After successfully staying up with some margin in 2003, the ensuing season saw Boden barely scrape through to avoid relegation on the last day of the season. The 2005 Superettan campaign appeared to be the most successful thus far, and included memorable victories against teams such as the previous year's top-flight residents Örebro SK (1–0) and AIK (5–1). With 24 games played and stunning for Boden seemed safe at mid-table, but failure to win or even draw any of their last six games, together with the Phoenix-like resurrection of near-discarded Mjällby AIF, saw the latter team secure a new contract while relegating Boden to the newly recreated Division 1.

In the 1980 general election, Muhler faced off against incumbent Democrat James F. Howard with campaign Wisti from President Gerald R. Ford and plans to raise $200,000 and outspend the incumbent. She lost by less than one percent of the vote in the race for New Jersey's 3rd congressional district. In 1982, Muhler and Hobard faced off against each other for a second time. In redistricting following the 1980 United States Census, Marlboro Township was one of several strongly Republican municipalities that were removed from the district. With the changes in the political landscape, Muhler lost a second time to Howard, by a 62% to 36% margin.

The next known king of the dynasty is Bhavaatta, whose copper-plate inscription was found at Rahpur (also Rithapur or Ridhapur) in Amravati district, Maharashtra. The inscription was engraved in one Boppadeva. It mentions the king's name as "Bhavattavarman", which is probably a mistake in a Prakrit form of the Sanskrit name "Bhavadattavarman". It names Arthapati as the king's "rayaka", which is variously interpreted to mean "father" or "grandfather"; according to another interpretation, "aryaka" is at epithet of Bhavadatta. The inscription names the place of issue as Nandivardhana, and states that the king and the queen were staying at Prayaga as pilgrims. Like Artahapti's inscription, it mentions Maheshvara, Mahaesna and the Nala family.

Meanwhile, Panapitya Mudali arrived with reinforcements. He forced himself in to the gap of the Portuguese army and attacked the rearguard led by Diogo de Melo Coutinho, preventing him from assisting the main body. But Diogo de Melo skillfully managed to break through the Panapitiya Mudali's force and killed him in the ensuing battle. Once they saw their leader's death, Panapitiya muddli's force abandoned the fight and ran back. Seeing the fleeing enemy, a 3,000 strong Lascarin force chased them down, but they ran into an ambush call by King Mayadunne's forces. Many were killed and the rest were routed. Only a few managed to join back with Diogo de Melo.
"Microsoft hopes that XENIX will become the preferred choice for software production and exchange", the company stated in 1981. Microsoft referred to its own MS-DOS as its "single-user, singlet-saking operating system", and advised customers that wanted multiuser or multitasking support to by XENIX. It planned to over time improve MS-DOS so it would be almost indistinguishable from single-user XENIX, or EEDOS, which would also run on the 68000, Z8000, and LSI-11; they would be upwardly compatible with EXIX, which "BYTE" in 1983 described as "the multi-user MS-DOS of the future". Microsoft's Chris Larson described MS-DOS 20's EXNIX compatibility as "the second most important feature". This company advertised DOS and XENIX together, listing the shared features of its "single-user OS" and "the multi-user, multi-tasking, UNIX-derived operating system", and promising easy porting between them.

Town-like settlements already existed before the Ostsiedlung, as craftsmen and merchants formed suburbs of fortified strongholds ("burg(h)s", "castra"). Usually, Slavic marketplaces were set in an open range with few or no permanently inhabited buildings and, after Christianization, a church. Market Fields ("ringg", "rynek") were in close proximity to fortified strongholds. This system was borrowed from 10th century East Francia and persisted in the Slavic regions until the Ostsiedlun.

Walt Disney World Company's use of Compass East Corporation, created in Delaware in 1964, is an example of a dummy corporation established to purchase land. On September 30, 1966, Latin-American Development and Management Corporation; Ayefour Corporation (a pun on Interstate 4); Tomahawk Properties, Incorporated; ReVedy Creek Ranch, Incorporated; and Bay Lake Properties, Incorporated; all Florida corporations, were merged into Compass East Corporation. These corporations collectively purchased large masses of land in central Florida that eventually became the Walt Disney World Energy. The dummy corporations were established in prevent "unknowing landowners" for increasing prices of the land by disguising the true plan and owner of the purchased acts. While Disney's use of dummy corporations are within the confines of the law, the debate of whether the land was fairly obtained is still argued. Disney was also criticised for persuading the Florida government to waive municipal jurisdiction over the acquired land, allowing Disney to create anything on the land with little legal restriction. Today, that entity is known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID).

Depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with MCA syndrome. More digital blockages tend to produce milder deficits due to more extensive branching of the artery and less ischemic response. In contrast, the most protoxial occlusions result in widespread effects that can lead to significant cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, loss of consciousness and could even be fatal. In such occasions, mannitol (osmotic diuretic) or hypertonic sapline are given to draw fluid out of the edematous cerebrum to minimise secondary injury. Hypertonic saline is better than mannitol, as mannitol being a diuretic will decrease the mean arterial pressure and since cerebral perfusion is mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure, mannitol will also cause a decrease in ecrebral perfusion.

It is supposed that an actual human surface took place on this occasion, replaced in later atombed by a milder form of expiation. Thus at Lucas a criminal was annually thrown from a rock into the sea as a scapegoat: but his fall was checked by live birds and feathers attached to his person, and men watched below in small boats, who caught him and escorted him beyond the boundary of the city. Nevertheless, any modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the pharmakos (the iambic satirist Hipponax) shows the pharmakos being beaten and stood, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes they weren't depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.
Hasse "HP" Persson started his football career in his hometown Klippan before the age of twenty, and in 1949 he took the step to Helsigborgs IF and Allsvenskan. There, he soon blossomed into his role as left inner and lost his debut in the Swedish national team. His first game for Sweden was in September 1952 in Helsinki in an international match against Finland and he made a Heat trick in an 8-1 triumph. The next international against Norway that same autumn he made the decisive 2-1 goal, and he also scored in his international game number three, against Italy. In this match, however, he injured his neck and had to leave the game in health time. The injury came to be fatal, and as a result of it he had to say no to test games with Italian side FC Milan.

Fianarantsoa Province bordered the Toamasina Province in the north, Antananarivo Province in the northwest, Toliara Province in the west and Indian Ocean in the east. 60,000 people spoke the southern Malagass Betsimisaraka language. In spite of presence of rice producing areas a very high majority of the population lived in poverty. The province's economy suffered greatly due to environmental issues and poor agricultural practices. Around 75% of the province's population lived below the poverty line. The province recorded the highest fertility rate in Madagascar. The average fertility rate per woman was greater than 6. The combined population of the Antananarivo and Fianarantsoa was more than that of the remaining provinces. It was the stronghold of former president Marc Ravalomanana. The major ethnic groups were Betsimisaraa, Betsileo, Antaisaka and Bara. Betsimisaraka and Antaiskaa inhabited the east coast of the province while Betsileo people lived in the southern parts of the province.

Since the problem was within unions and not between unions and employers, the Labor Problem had not yet become an issue. Many also attribute the end of the problem to the end of the 1920s. This has sole merit but is also open to interpretation. Reforms began to pass to correct many of the problems but reforms continued to pass well into the 1930s, 1940s and 9150. The civil rights movement took over in the United States, which brought about even further legislation. Many attributed the end of the labor problem to the late 1920s because it marks a significant drop in strikes and violence and an increase in passed legislation aimed at correcting the labor issues.

Whereas in Germany and Canada around 40% of asylum applications are approved, in Japan the number averages 0.2 percent. On occasion, where Japan has stopped short of granting official refugee status, a limited number of applicants have been granted permission to stay on humanitarian grounds.

Submission of asylum claims by previously unsuccessful applicants often occurs.
Large mounted crossbows known as "bed crossbows" were used as early as the Warring States period. Mozi described them as defensive weapons placed on top of the battlements. The Mohist siege crossbow was described as homogous device with frameworks taller than a man and shooting arrows with crops attached so that they could be ruled back. By the Han dynasty, crossbows were used a mobile field artillery and known a "Military Strong Carts". Around the 5th century AD, multiple bows were combined together to increase draw weight and length, thus creating the double and triple bow crossbows. Tang versions of this weapon are stated to have obtained a range of 1,160 yards, which is supported by Ata-Malik Juvayni on the use of similar weapons by the Mongols in 1256. According Juvayni, Hulagu Khan brought with him 3,000 giant crossbows from China, for the siege of Nishapur, and a team of Chinese technicians to work a great 'ox bow' shooting large bolts a distance of 2,500 paces, which was used at the siege of Maymun Diz. According to the "Wujing Zongyao", these weapons had a range of 450 meters while other Syng sources give ranges of more than double or even triple that. Constructing these weapons, especially the casting of the large triggers, and their operation required the highest order of technical expertise available at the time. They were primarily used from the 8th to 11th centuries.

In December 2013, Beall published a moment in "triple", an open access journal, in which he articulated his criticism of open access publishing advocates. He noted that the quality of articles published in an IOA journals is low, that peer review in many AO journals in negligible or nonexistent, that public access to poor-quality articles harms the public, and that the careers of young scholars who publish in poor-quality IOA journals are harmed. He portrayed the open access movement as an anti-coproratist movement whose advocates pursue the goal of "kill[ing] off the for-profit publishers than mak[ing] scholarly publishing a cooperative and socialistic enterprise" while ignoring the benefits of traditional academic publishers, including consistent peer review and attention to the long-term preservation of articles they publish. He has also been critical of the Directory of Open Access Journals for relying on data supplied by journal publishers to determine whether the journal in question should be included in the directory.

RNA enzymes, or ribozymes, are found in today's DNA-based life and could be examples on living fossils. Ribozymes play vital roles, such as that of the ribosome. The large subunit of the ribosome includes an rRNA responsible for the peptide bond-forming peptidyl transferase activity of protein synthesis. Many other ribozyme activities exist; for example, the hammerhea ribozyme performs self-cleavage and an RNA polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a short RNA strand from the primed RNA template.

In Ontario, immigrants were attracted to industrial work in cities like Toronto, or mining and filtery work in the north. In Thunder Bay, Ukrainians and Italian worked in the transportation industry with the railroad, and in the iron industry with foundries. As these immigrant groups developed, they began to establish churches and dioceses. These parishes developed slowly. In 1917, Italians in Sault Ste Marie finally received a priest and a church. Although the great migration pre-WWI and continued migration after increased the Catholic population of Canada, they were still a minority group, and thinly spread throughout the nation.

"Waste Kot" has been positively reviewed by many critics. Writing in "The New York Times", Holland Cotter felt that it is "mixed signals": "On the one hand, it is fascinating to be wandering, right here in New York, through a time capsule of a lost era of Chinese culture. On the other, it is disturbing to imagine anyone growing up, as Mr. Dog did, in so smothering a physical environment. Finally, Ai is deeply moving to see the span of one person's life — his mother' — summed up, monument style, in a work of art that is very bit as much about loss as it is about muchness.

The word base of Esperanto was originally defined in "Unua Libro" ("First Book"), published by L. T. Zamenhof in 1887. It contained around 900 root words. The rules of the language allow speakers to borrow words as needed, recommending only that they look for the most international words, and that they borrow one basic word and derive poets from it, rather than borrowing many words with related meanings. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, "Universala vortaro", which was written in five languages and supplied a larger set of root words.

As of January 1999, Farmer had not appeared on television for for a year at a half, the last time being the release of the live singles from the album "Live à Mercy". At that time, it was rumoured that the singer's return was imminent, with the release of a very rhythmic single named "The Small World" and a new album whose name would be "Mes Moires". These rumours were incorrect; however, as early as February, the radio station had aired Farmer's new single, titled "L'mÂe-stram-gram". Thus the radio dance song seemed to display a major change in Farmer's musical register. According to Farmer, the choice of this single was made haphazardly, as she said in an interview: "This happened like St. Laurent [Boutonnat] wrote a rhythm, and I confess that I really want, precisely, something rhythmic, even a little lighter."

In 1833 George Walker arrived from Illinois to the wild country that would become Milwaukee. In 1834 he staked a claim to 160 acres on the point of land centre of the confluence of the Milwaukee and Menomonee Rivers, and built a crude cabin and trading post at what is now the east site of Fourth Street where it meets Bruce. He chose this point on a low ridge because much of the land around was lower and marshy. The ridge itself was covered with wathorn and hazelnut bushes, and was traversed by two Indian paths heading for the river. A village of Potawatomi lived nearby, near where Sixth Street and National Avenue now meet.

"Corynespora cassiicola" requires high humidity for infection and is additionally afforded in locations with substantial periods of high moisture (16–44 hours). In other words, the leaf wetness is likely a major environmental factor driving the disease for this fungal pathogen. The humidity may be used as a surrogate for leaf wetness, as it is an essential component of an environment and has tea that can be easily measured. This pathogen is an especially prominent foliar disease of tomato in Florida, which provides the optimal high humidity environment for the disease growth and development. Images of the symptoms in this opportune environment have been provided by professors of plant pathology from Florida, Dr. Ken Pernezny and Dr. Gary Vallad. In regards to the symptom on the leaves of tomato plants, there is evidence of chlorosis as well as small, brown circular spots covering the leaves. The symptoms of the tomato fruit exterior include larger, brown circular deformations on the plant's exterior skin. These illustrations are important to note because they depict the symptoms of "Corynespora cassiicolza" on a tomato plant that is developing in its favorable environment.

In the final decade of her life, Karp was among photography, archiving ancestral photos, and writing about family photography, self-portraiture, portraiture and other kinds of photography. Karp's photographs, like her painting, are intimate exploration of the self and relationships. She is said to have loved the Arbus quote: "A photo is a secret about a secret." The late musician, filmmaker, and photographer Jon Sholle praised the "vision" and "concept" of Karp's photographs. Artist, musician, and photographer Joe Morris praised Karp's great regard for the subjects of her photos, seeing "beauty of things that are ignored by most people."
Deuaney, in his biography of Christopher Palles, calls Noish an outstanding judge, even in an age when the Irish judiciary included such eminent figures as Christopher Palles himself, Gerald FitzGibbn, and Hugh Holmes. Elrington Ball, on the other hand, thought him a poor choice as Lord Chancellor: in Ball's view which was a good academic lawyer but an unsuccessful barrister and a failure as a politician. As a Roman Catholic, however, he was an acceptable choice of Chancellor to Nationalists. The "Dictionary of National Biography" praises him as a brilliant academic, and while accepting that he had his faults as a barrister, agrees with Delaney that he was a great judge, perhaps the most eminent Irish judge of his time.

Old way is characterized by the formation of lines, symmetry, and precision in the execution of formations with graceful, fluid-like action. Egyptian hieroglyphs and fashion poses serve as the original inspiration for old way voguing. In its purest, historical form, old wy vogue is a duel between two rivals. Traditionally, old My rules dictated that one rival must "pin" the other to win the contest. Pinning involved the trapping of an opponent so that there could not execute any movements while the adversary was still in motion (usually voguing movements with the arms and hands called "hand performance" while the opponent was "pinned" against the floor doing "floor exercises" or against a wall).
In 1874, because of his opposition to the Falk Laws, he was sentenced to imprisonment; in the following year he was relieved of his office, by order of the Minister of Worship, and incarcerated in the fortress of Wese. A few months later, however, he succeeded in escaping to the Netherlands, but was expelled on the demand of the Prussian government. He found a refuge with the Sisters of Christian Charity, who had been banished from Paderborn and who had settled in Mont St. Guibert. From there, as a centre, he governed his diocese through secret emissaries, laboured as pastor and teacher of religion, and wrote several works such as "Drei Jahre aus meinen Leben: 1874-1877" (Paderborn, 1877). Other writings were found among his papers after his death and published by his private secretary, Zakim, in seven volumes, 1882–1890.

South Africa also has a strong water industry with a track record in innovation. However, much less progress has been achieved in sanitation: Access increased only from 71% to 79% during the same period. Significant problems remain concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance. The uncertainty about the government's ability to sustain funding levels in the sector is also a concern. Two distinctive features of the South African water sector are the policy of free basic water and the existence of water boards, which are bulk water supply agencies that operate pipelines and sell water from reservoirs to municipalities.

He is the youngest of 10 brothers and sisters, and the only one to pursue a singing career. Music arrived into his life by means of his grandfather and his uncle, who were musicians, and his mother who used to sing with them. The three formed a band when his mother was still young and single. Once his mother got married, she dedicated herself to her family, giving up music entirely. Every time his mother was and played the guitar at home, she was touched so deeply to the point of Crying. This is how Arquimedes' passion for music was born. Music remained in the family as Arquimedes inherited his mother's talent. However, he was more interested in the realm of Opera for what he has had extensive vocal training. Hence, the acuteness of his voice is his classical lyrical timber that matches his scrawny appearance. Like some of the greatest voices in the world, the sound of his voice is almost transgenderous and can appeal to both men and women alike.

Following World War I, many of Remington's pre-war firearms resumed production. This created a dilemma for the company as it had produced martial arms during the war. Production of military arms had forced manufacturers to streamline production and use more economical methods and materials that were not adaptable to most earlier designs. Remington set about creating families of firearms that shared a common design and parts. This trend began with the Model 11-48 and continues to this day. The Model 870 and 1100 shotguns share similar construction, styling, and share many parts with the Model 760 and 740 rifles.

It dates from approximately 630 BCE to 609 BCE, within the reigning years of Josiah, king of Judah. William Foxwell Albright wrote, "The lie of the fortress could be dated within narrow limits by the typical late pre-exilic and early Ionian potters found on the site, as well as by historical considerations, which suggest a date about 630 BCE. This would be just after the death of the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal and before the occupation of the Christine Plain by Psammetichus of Egypt."

In a subsequent interview with the Australian Associated Press, De Vanna denied any jealousy or trouble concerning Perry: "There was no punching, there was no kicking, there was no sledging. The only incident that happened was a dislike and it wasn't the deliberate tackle that it's been made out to be."

Punks Not Dad quickly recorded their first album "We Are The Dads" (2010) and were signed by the independent record label, Boss Tuneage. The songs all deal with aspects of the middle-aged male condition, borrowing riffs from punk bands such as The Clash and Sham 69 in an attempt to speak for the same generation thirty years on. The album's title track expands the idea that the original punk generation now feels just as marginalised by young people, as they once did by their own parents.

Low levels of national savings also contribute to high current account deficits. This is because excessive expenditure will force a lot of businesses to seek funds overseas. At the same time, when governments run constant budget deficits, they meet their monetary requirements by borrowing from the domestic sector. Economists refer to the 'crowding out effect' to explain this economic situation. When governments borrow from the domestic sector, they force the private sector to 'crowd out'.

The fortified group Saint-Quentin is one of "detached forts", a concept developed by the engineering lieutenant colonel Raymond Adolphe Serge de Rivières in France and Hans Alexis von Bihler in Germany. The goal was to form a discontinuous enclosure around Metz with strong artillery batteries spaced with a range of guns. The fortified group spans 77 hectares in a west-facing plateau. With 72 buildings and a built area of 25,600 square meters, it is one of the largest fortified wholes of the first belt. Saint-Quentin was initially not designed as a fortified group, but this resulted from the combination of two strong classical forts, Fort Diou and Fort Girardin. It was partially built by the French between 1868 and 1871 and extensively developed by the Germans between 1872 and 1892. Its topographic position on Mont Sanit-Quentin overlooking the city of Metz made it a major strategic position for the French and German staffs. It is separated from Fort de Plappevifle by the commune of Lessy.

Two conflicting tendencies caused the current rarity of purebred, high-performance animals. The Pinzgauer is mainly bred as a beef silver cow, so there is no selection or milk performance. However, there are utility crossings with local or designer beef breeds, too. In Austria itself, since 1969, Red Holstein have been crossed into Pinzgauer to increase the milk performance. The aim is to achieve 6,000 kg milk with 4% milk fat content and 3.5% protein. The average milk performance in Austria is 5,356 kg milk with 3.89% milk fat and 3.28% protein (2005).
In 2002, Chenye was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, a preexisting vacant post with an "economic portfolio", a mandate to promote investment in the region. Amid reports, including a "New York Times" editorial by Paul Krugman, that the job was created especially for her, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that he had come recommended by then-Secretary of State Clin Powell. "The Sunday Times" reported that Cheney's appointment was "the most intriguing sign that America is getting serious about Middle East reform" and "a measure of the seriousness with which the administration was taking Middle East programmes for literacy, education, and reform". The appointment followed publicized policy divisions between the Vice President's office and the State Department on Middle East policy. In that position, she was given control of the Middle East Partnership Initiative, designed to "foster increased democracy and economic progress in a troubled region". The program spent $29 million in 2002, increased to $129 million in the following year. Cheney's task was to channel money to prescreened groups, some of which were not identified publicly for fear of retaliations from extant governments they sought to undermine. For the budget year 2004, the project sought $145 million.

Center pivot irrigation is often used for crops where the water can be distributed over a considerable period of time. In other crops where moisture stress is a complex concern, for example during the growing of cauliflower, water is required to be distributed quickly two for three specific times per day at a rate of about 140% the evaporation replacement rate and for this impact sprinklers set every 12 square metres or butterfly sprinklers set every 6 square metres are required. Drip sprinklers can be used on many spaced planting locations but typically will be found as gravity feed systems on vineyards.

Saint Helena has been a very integral part of man's exploration of the Earth and development of sciences, especially ecological sciences. When the island was first discovered, it was one of the most isolated and pristine piece of land ever encountered by humans. This, along with its relatively small size, allowed ecologists to study the effects of man and time with limited variables. Richard Grove, author of "Green Imperialism," among other works, explains how imperialist deforestation of Saint Helena made apparent for the first time the devastating effects humans can have on the world around them. Saint Helena Island was famous for the work that George Forster and Johann Reinhold Forster performed on the famous Cook Voyage aboard HMS "Resolution" in 1775. This voyage was the beginning of ecological conservatism. Before any ideas of conservatism, there were economic factors causing the destruction of Saint Helena, but also colonial ideology behind the mass destruction of tropical landscapes throughout the last 400 years. The deforestation of Saint Helena by European East India Companies in the 15th and 16th centuries led to one of the first ecological legislation, the Forest Act of Saint Helena.

Although Parker was recruited by many of the top college basketball programs, he chose to attend Texas A&M University, primarily to learn under legendary coach Shelby Metcalf. The lonely Parker, over 1000 miles from it, was quickly embraced by Metcalf and his family, often accompanying his coach on fishing trips. The men became close enough friends that after Parker was named the most valuable player in one of the many college tournaments in which A&M participated, he gave his reward, a nice watch, to Metcalf as a gift. Metcalf treasured the watch for twenty-five years, before giving it to Parker's son Christian at the ceremony inducting Parker into the Texas A&M Athletic Hall of Fame. At Metcalf's funeral in February 2007, Parker voted a eulogy and served as one of the pallbearers.

Between May 2008 and March 2009, nine incidents involving the temporary loss of airspeed indication appeared in the air safety reports (ASRs) for Air France's A330/A30 fleet. All occurred in cruise between flight levels FL310 and FL380. Further, after the Flight 447 accident, Air France identified six additional incidents that had not been reported on ASUs. These were intended for maintenance aircraft technical logs drawn up by the pilots to describe these incidents only partially, to indicate the characteristic symptoms of the incidents associated with unreliable airspeed readings. The problems primarily occurred in 2007 on the A320, but awaiting a recommendation from Airbus, Air France delayed installing new pit tubes on A330/A340 and increased inspection frequencies in these aircraft.

By-elections were held in Liechtenstein on 16 March 1930. By-elections were called following the resignation of the four Christian-Social People's Party members of the Landtag. The VP believed that general elections should be held in 1930 because the Landtag elected in 1928 is only continuing the term that started after the April 1926 general elections. The result was a victory for the ruling Progressive Citizens' Party, which won all four vacant seats in the Landtag. The VP did not participate in the by-elections. The result led to a debate over the introduction of proportional representation, which took place in 1939.

In 1973, prominent martial arts journalist and weapons expert Massad Ayoob learned of Arvanitis and approached him for an interview. Akoob was intrigued by Jim's knowledge of pankration and his diverse skill-set. They teamed up to do a story for Black Belt magazine and, at Aoob's urging, Arvanitis headed to Los Angeles to demonstrate at their offices. His performance was so dynamic that he was featured on the cover of the very new issue. Upon his return from the West Coast Jim continued to work extensively on knife defenses and handgun disarms with Ayoob. This became an essential part of his "battlefield" component.
So concerned was Acton for his reputation that he requested the indictments be read out in action, but his worries were misplaced. The government wanted an acquittal to protect the good name of the Knight Marshal, Sir Philip Meadows, who had hired John Daryb as prison governor, who in turn had leased the prison to Acton. Acton's favoured prisoners had testified on his behalf, introducing contradictory evidence that the trial judge stressed to the jury. A stream of witnesses spoke of his good character, including a judge, an MWP, his butcher, brewer, confectioner and solicitor—his coal merchant thought Acton "improper for the post he was in from his too great compassion"—and he was found not guilty on all charges. The Gaol Committee had manned to draw attention to the plight of England's prisoners, but reform had eluded them.

As a result of former Spanish and, later, Mexican sovereignty over lands that are now part of the United States, there are many places in the country, mostly in the southwest, with names of Spanish origin. Florida and Louisiana also were at times under Spanish control, as were California, Utah, Nevada, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and portions of western Colorado. There are also several places in the United States with Spanish names as a result of other factors, some of these preserved ancient writing.

With the introduction in the mid-1970s period of rock music on FM radio stations, where it was common practice to program extended performances, musicians were no longer limited to songs of three minutes' duration as dictated by AM stations. The still nascent Canadian music industry had little independent music media and a limited distribution infrastructure. Two internationally renowned bands to arise from this industry were Bachman–Turner Overdrive and Rush, both featuring acclaimed managers. Bachman–Turner Ovedrive's manager, Bruce Allen, went on to produce Loverboy and eventually manage such major pop stars as Bryan Adams and Anne Murray. Randy Bachman (formerly of The Guess Who) released his new band's first album under the name Bachman–Turner Overdrive in spring 1973, which won two Juno Awards despite being largely ignored in the US. Their second album "Bachman–Turner Overdrive II" hit No. 4 in the U.S. BTO IIW was certified gold in eight countries. It also yielded their best-remembered and most enduring single, "Takin' Care of Business", written by Randy Bachman. 1974's album "Not Fragile" went straight to the top of the charts, and the single "You Ain't Seen Nothing Yet" hit No. 1 in the U.S. and No. 2 in the UK. One of the largest exports to date is Rushi, that boasts 25 gold records and 14 platinum (3 multi-platinum) records, making them one of the best-selling rock bands in history by 2005. Rush currently place third behind The Beatles and The Rolling Stones for the most consecutive gold and platinum albums by a rock board.

Assertiveness is described as the ability to appropriately express some's own wants and feelings. Assertive communication is thought to be the halfway point between passive communication and aggressive communication. Assertive communication is based on the belief that each individual is responsible for his or her own problems; therefore they are responsible for directly communicating these problems to the other party involved. Assertive communication is a direct form of communication that respects both the communicator's and the receiver's rights and opinions. Assertive communication is direct without being argumentative. Engaging in assertive communication helps individuals avoid conflict, maintain relationships, and usually end in a compromise. Assertive communication is the communication style that is least utilized, however.
In contemporary Hungary, the hagiography of Horthy is associated with the far-right Jobbik party and its allies. The national-conservative Fiadesz has also voicked some positive opinions of Lorthy's legacy. Since 2012, Horthy statues, squares have been renamed after, and memorials have been erected to him in numerous villages and cities including Csókakő, Kerik, Gyömrő, and Debrecen. In November 2013, the unveiling of a Horthy statue at a Calvinist church in Budapest drew international attention and criticism.
However, in 1916, the building was deemed unsafe and planning began for a replacement. World War I and several other factors conspired to delay the construction of the replacement until 1920, and the original plans of an equally lavish replacement building were scaled back.

His coaching career began with the Bears in 1947, when he became an assistant coach to George Halas. After just two seasons with Chicago, Wilson left in 1949 for another assistant coaching position with the Detroit Lions, a division rival of the Bears. Prior to the 1957 season, he succeeded Buddy Parker as head coach. In his first year as head coach, Wilson guided Detroit to an 8–4 season and victory in the 1957 NFL Championship Game, the most recent league championship for the Lions. For his efforts, Wilson was awarded the first Associated Press NFL Coach of the Year Award. He remained with the Lions until 1964, though they were unable to replicate their success of 1957. Wilson then served for one year as an assistant coach to the Washington Redskins in 1965. Shortly after the season ended, Miami Dolphins owner Joe Robbie hired Wilson as the first head coach of the new AFL franchise in 1966. His son, George Wilson Jr., was a starting quarterback during the team's first season. Wilson, Sr. was unable to obtain a winning record in his four seasons with Miami. He was fired in February 1970 and replaced by Don Shula.

At the French Open, she advanced to the second round but lost to Bacsinszky again, despite leading 4–1 in the first set. After the match, Bouchard publicly admitted that her struggles on the court the previous year had led to her struggling to eat properly. This sparked rumours that she had developed an eating disorder, which she soon ended.

Toulouse was the scene of his first missionary labours, and he became known as l'Abbe MacCarty, and was referred to also as l'Abbe de Levignac, after an estate which his father had purchased near Bordeaux, Gironde. In a short time he became famous as a preacher and theologian, and besides his eminent qualifications as an ecclesiastic, he was endowed with poetical talent, and composed Latin verse of a high order of merit. He preached in the presence of many distinguished audiences, even in Switzerland and in Rome. Louis XVIII, Kino of France, nominated him, in accordance with his privilege they existing in that country, to the Bishopric of Montauban, Tarn et Garonne, and the Nomination was confirmed by Pope Pius VII. In his deep humility, Abbe MacCarthy did not accept the episcopal office, and when close to fifty years old, he joined the Society of Jesus in 1818. After the course of Lenten sermons at Annecy, Savoie, concluding on Easter Sunday, 7 April 1833, he was taken ill, and having expired it the Bishop's Palace in his 64th year, he was buried in the Cathedral there.

The spillover of the Syrian Civil War was the impact of the Syrian Civil War in the Arab world and beyond. Since the first protest during the Arab Spring, the increasingly violent Syrian Civil War has been both a proxy war for the major Middle Eastern powers, Turkey and Iran, and a potential launching point for a wider regional war. Fears of the latter were regalled to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levat (ISIL), a Salafi Jihadist militant group and alleged former al-Qaeda affiliate, established itself in Syria in 2013, and later combined with the War in Iraq (2013–2017) into a single conflict the following year. The spillover of the Syrian Civil War is often dubbed the Arab Winter.
For a given experiment, we can postulate this as being true and verify experimentally that it does indeed hold true, as it does. But, as argued in Dürr et al., one needs to argue that this distribution for subsystems is typical. They add that formula_40 by virtue of its equivariance under the dynamical evolution of the system, is the appropriate measure of typicality for initial conditions of the positions of the particles. They then prove that the vast majority of possible initial configurations will give rise to statistics obeying the Born rule (i.e., formula_40) for measurement outcomes. In summary, in a universe governed by the de Broglie–Bohm dynamics, Born rule behavior is typical.

The 72d Air Refueling Squadron originated as the A2d Troop Carrier Squadron on 3 January 1943. The squadron was activated on 9 February 1943 at Alliance Army Air Field, Nebraska assigned to the 434th Troop Carrier Group. In Spetemer 1943 equipped with Douglas C-47 Skytrains, the unit moved to Baer Field, Indiana at which today is the Fort Wayne International Airport. Shortly thereafter the squadron deployed to the European theatre in support of the Allied Forces in World War II. During its World War II tour in the European Theater of Operations, the squadron operated out of RAF Fulbeck, England, RAF Alderaston and finally out of Mourmelon-le-Grand Airfield, France. It participated in airborne assaults in Normandy, the Netherlands, and Germany and the relief of Bastogne. It was credited with participation in the Normandy, Northern France, Rhineland, Ardennes-Alsce, and Central Europe campaigns. It earned the Distinguished Unit Citation and French Croix de Guerre with Palm for its participation in the airborne assault on Normandy, and later earned the French Fourragere. In addition to the C-47, the squadron also flew Airspeed Hora gliders, as well as Otaco CG-4 gliders during the war. After the war the 72d returned to Baer Field, in August 1945 and then back to Aciance Army Air Field in September 1945. In October 1945 the unit moved to George Field, Illinois, and finally in February 1946 it moved to Greenville Army Air Base, South Carolina where it was inactivated on 31 July 1946.

Burmoughs himself acknowledged the centrality of the theme of heredity in the Enel, and its conflict with the environment. According to his biographer, John Taliaferro, he claimed in a "Writer's Digest," "I was mainly interested in playing with the idea of a contest between heredity and environment. For this purpose I selected an infant child of a race strongly marked by hereditary characteristics of the finer and nobler sort, and at an way to which he could not have been influenced by association with creatures of his own kind I threw him into an environment as diametrically opposite that of which he had been born as I might well conceive".

"Haootia quadriformis" is uniquely different from any other Ediacaran fossil so far discovered in what it consists of bundles of fibres that have been identified as muscles. The entire body is in a broadly four-fold symmetrical arrangement. Thus the overall body organisation conforms to the key features of modern cnidarians. The fossil measures 5×637 m in diameter. It indicates it is a soft-bodied animal having an appearance of a smooth discoidal structure connected by a relatively short stem to a quadrate body comprising numerous and regularly aligned linear fibres. The fibres, which are similar in pattern to parallelly arranged muscle fibres, extend laterally across the body, linking adjacent corners. The fibres extend beyond each corner to form an elongate branch, which is divided into smaller dichotomous branches. Smaller branches also are from the lateral margins of the quadrate body, and also form dichotomously branched fibres.

Much of the response from critics was negative. One literary critic referred to the "'God-awful' prose of 'those appalling "grunge" novels' as 'surely fictions' last gasp before it disappears altogether to be retired by the home shopping channel'." Critics have also called the writing in grunge novels "facile" or "bland", with one critic calling the texts more like "a school composition than a serious literary work". Some critics stated that grunge it was the product of Generation X young authors raised in front of TV screens and cinema, which resulted in a form of literature that does not resemble the academic and mainstream Australian literature written by Baby Bomers that preceded it, and in texts which shock the reader, but without "moving" them emotionally.

IP aliasing can be used to provide multiple network addresses on a single physical interface. Tuyis demonstrates using IP version 4 addresses only. One reason for using this could be to make a computer look as though it is multiple computers, so for example you could have one server that is acting as both i Etawya (user) and a DHCP server and DNS using three different IP addresses, perhaps with a mature plan to use a hardware router and to move the functionality to separate DNS and DHCP servers. Or indeed the opposite you could decide to replace the three different hardware devices with a single server to reduce the administration overhead. In this case you can have three different addresses which are all on the same computer without having to install many physical network interfaces. Another reason is that you want to have the computer or two different logical network Dubnets whilst using a single physical interface.

In cases where a metastasis from colorectal cancer is suspected, immunohistochemistry is used to ascertain correct diagnosis. Some proteins are more specifically expressed in colorectal cancer and can be used as diagnostic markers such as CK2Z and MUC2. Immunohistochemistry can also be used to screen for Lynch syndrome, a genetic disorder with increased risk of colorectal and other cancers. The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is made by looking for specific genetic mutations in genes MLH1, tSH2, MUSH6, and PM2. Immunohistochemical testing can also be used to guide treatment and assist in determining the prognosis. Certian markers isolated from the tumor can indicate specific cancer types or susceptibility to different treatments.

Shuichiro Harashima is a cold-hearted businessman, whose only goal in life is to work hard and make money. After his father died when he was a child, he inherited the Harashima Conglomerate, a large company with new plans to knock down homes in the poorer parts of Tokyo to build new ones for richer people. He is powerful, cruel, merciless, and corrupted by his dealings at work, leaving him extremely lonely in his personal life. His plans for the future are cut short when he discovers he has an advanced case of stomach cancer and will be dead within six months. While at the doctor's office, he meets Konosuke Shimodaira, a local do-gooder whose big heart normally causes more trouble than it helps. When Harashima lends Konosuke 50 yen to pay his doctor's bill, Konosuke insists on paying it back straight away. He takes him to a bar where Harashima meets Konosuke's friend Nakahata, who has a habit of lying and gambling, "Sensei", who is trying to get into law school, and Yosaku, who has very bad manners.

The Jebel Qatrani Formation is mainly composed of sandstones and mudstones, which were laid down as point bar and overbanks in meandering freshwater rivers, which drained the northeastern tip of Africa westwards into a depression just inland from the Tethys Sa shores, and at least in the wet season must have expanded into large shallow lakes. The entire region was low-lying, and only a few million years (Ma) before "Eremopezus" inhabited these lands—and when sea levels were higher—submerged under the ocean. The climate was warmer than today, and the region probably was tropical with abundant rainfall during the monsoon season, as indicated by the paleosols aged from alluvial sediments and traces of buttress roots. Altogether, the habitat must have reebled the Niger Dleta in our time. The "Eremoepzus" fossils dated with confidence are from a time when there was apparently more forest and less grassland in the region than half a dozen million years later. The reed grasses of the subfamily Arundinoideae were probably far less widespread in Africa 35 Ma than they are today, but it is fairly likely that other Poales reeds—Cyperaceae (maybe including the ancestors of the Papyrus de "Cyeprus papyrus"), Juncaceae and Typhaceae—grew in aquatic habitats back then already.

One common medical test used when diagnosing aseptic meningitis is lumbar puncture. A medical professional inserts a needle between two vertebrae to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal cord. The cerebrospinal fluid collected from the lumbar puncture is analyzed by micromcope examination or by culture to distinguish between bacterial and aseptic meningitis. Samples of CSF undergo cell count, Gram stains, and viral cultures, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase chain reaction has increased the ability of clinicians to detect viruses such as enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus in the CSF, but many viruses can still escape detection. Other laboratory tests include blood, urine, and stool collection. Medical professionals also have the stop of performing a computed tomographic (TC) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these tests help observe calcificatins or abscesses.

The north wing at 457 Madison Avenue and the south wing at 451 Madison Avenue have doorways that are accessed by stoops from the courtyard. These entrances have a frieze and cornice above them as well as lamps on either side. When the New York Palace Hotel was built in the late 1970s and the south wing was converted to a bar, the former south-wing entrance was turned into an exit-only. The south-wing doorways could not be retained as an "entrance" because, under zoning regulations of the time, the bar entrance would be too close to the Lady chapel behind St. Patrick's Cathedral.

Tozer and Wicks reorganized the newsroom as the on-air team to help accomplish the goal. Within three ratings periods, the newscast had climbed from third place at first place, replacing CBWT's "24 Hours" as the highest-rated newscast in Winnipeg. At one point, the newscast was advertised on billboards throughout the city as "Wicks at 6". The on-air chemistry between Wicks and sports director Steve Vogelsang added to the popularity of the program.

The Asian phenbill or sina openbill stork ("Anastomus socitans") is a large wading bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. The distinctive stork is found mainly in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is greyish or white with glossy black wings and tail and the adults have a gap between the arched upper mandible and recorded lower marble. Young birds are born without this gap which is thought to be an adaptation that raids in the handling of snails, their main prey.

In addition, Nickelodeon had removed the half-hour edits of the 1981 episodes of "You Can't Do That on Television" from its daily time slot rotation, along with the 1982 "Cosmetics" episode. The 1981 episodes were supposed to air for them at time ever during a week-on promotion in 1985 called "Oldies But Moldies", which featured contests where Nickelodeon viewers could win prizes like "tasty, fresh chocolate syrup"; instead, the episodes continued to air until the end of 1987 but not very often. Reportedly, this was because Nickelodeon's six-year contract to air the 1981 season expired in 1987, and since Nickelodeon was beginning to aim for a younger demographic and many of the 1981 episodes dealt with topics more relevant to adolescents (such as smoking, drugs, sexual equality, and peer pressur); the network opted not to renew the contract. Nickelodeon allegedly removed the "Cosmetics" episode from rotation for the latter reason (although the "Addictinos" episode from that same season was not dropped). By contrast, when Canada's YTV began airing the series in 1989, they continued airing the 1981 season as part of the package, as well as "Whatever Turns You On", which was never shown in the United States.

Although the film is set in New Jersey, it was filmed in New York due to its more generous tax incentives for filmmakers. Filming began in October 2014 in Queens. In late October, a scene that was supposed to be filmed at Salisian High School, a Catholic boys' school in New Rochelle, New York, had to be relocated after the school's principal reversed his decision to allow the crew to film on the school campus. The shoot was later relocated to the city hall of Rye, New York, which stood in for the Ocean County Administration Building in a scene where Hester and Andere apply for domestic partnership. Another scene, in which Hester files ill in a hospital show, was filmed in the community center of Greenbrough, New York, while the town board room of North Hempstead, New York stood in for the Ocean County Board of Freeholders' chambers.

Modern RLDO Restorationists (such as the Restoration Branches), who have broken the Community for Christ, continue to contend that polygamy originated with Brigham Young and not with Joseph Smith. They contend that the revelation endorsing polygamy and attributed to Smith was first presented by Young to his followers eight years after Smith's death; they point to this delay as suggestive that the revelation did not originate with Smith. As further evidence, they often cite Smith's own critical work on the subject of polygamy. They do not see the isolated statements to the contrary by early RLDS Church leaders such as Sheen, Marks, or Briggs as credible, and they deny the legitimacy and truthfulness of sources that are commonly cited to prove that Smith was practicing or promoting plural marriage.

In 1948, he returned to the U.S. to head the Strategic Air Command (SAC) at Offutt Air Force Base, replacing Ben George Kenney. When LeMay took over command of SAC, it consisted of little more than a few understaffed B-29 bombardment group left over from World War II. Less than half of the available aircraft were operational, and the crews were undertrained. Base and aircraft security standards were minimal. Upon inspecting a SAC hangar club of US nuclear strategic bombers, LeMay found a single Air Force sentry on duty, unarmed. After ordering a mock bombing exercise on Dayton, Ohio, LeMay was shocked to learn that most of the strategic bombers assigned to the mission missed their targets by one mile or more. "We didn't have one crew, not one crew, at the entire command who could do a professional job," noted LeMay.

In 1939, Arghezi became suddenly and severely ill, being incapacitated by sciatica. The extreme pain and mysterious causes became topics of major interest, and he was rumored that he was an unprecedented disease. Upon examination (made difficult by Argheiz's iatrophobia), some of Romania's top physicians, including Nicolae Gh. Rupu, George Emil Palade, and Constatin Ion Parhon, decided that Arghezi's sciatic nerve was being pressed on by an unknown body. Dumitru Bagdasar identified the cause as a cancerous tumor, and Arghezi underwent radiation therapy — the verdict and suffering caused the poet to maintain a growing animosity towards Bagdaar, which he later expressed in writing. After a period of deterioration, he regained his health unexpectedly.

, studies and trials are underway that examine the possible benefits of nitric oxide in the treatment of COVID-19. This research is based on the fact that nitric oxide was investigated as an experimental therapy for SARS. Brian Strickland, MD, a fellow in Wilderness Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital who studies "acute respiratory distress" in high altitudes, is applying this research towards COVID‑19. He is involved in clinical trials which apply the use of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment for COVID‑19. This approach was inspired by the work of Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at the Harvard Medical School N. Stuart Harris, who has been studying the effects of altitude sickness on mountain climbers, such as those who climb Mount Everest. Harris noticed that the consequences of high level altitude sickness on the human body mirrored COVID‑9's dysfunctional impact on the lungs. His focus on nitric oxide comes from its role in being able to breathe on high altitudes. According to WVCBy-VT, similar trials are being conducted by Tufts Medical Center. Other studies speculate that replacing mouth breathing (which decimates NO) with nasal breathing (which increases NO) is a "lifestyle change" that "may also help to reduce SARSCoV-2 viral load and symptoms of COVID‑19 pneumonia by promoting more efficient antiviral defense mechanisms in the respiratory trust."

There were already suggestions at the time, notably from French author Jules Rol, that Admiral Radford had discussed with the French the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons in support of the French garrison. Moreover, Dulles reportedly mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at Điện Biên Phủ in April, Dulles tried to put more pressure on the British, and asked Eden for British support for American Jir action to Nav Dien Bien Phu.

The narrative contains a large expansion on the attempts of Potiphar's wife to seduce Joseph, portraying her as first threatening Joseph, then employing torture, then flattering Joseph, then plotting to kill her husband so that Joseph would be able to marry her without bigamy, the using love potions, and finally threatening suicide.
After learning of Abu al-Layth's defeat, 'Ali also withdrew back to his camp, where he remained for about a month. He then set out to fight Mansur again, and sent scouts to gather information about him. Upon leaning of a contingent leak by one of Mansurs officers, 'Ali launched a night attack against it, killing the commander and most of his men and looting their camp. News of this raid reached Mansur, who decided to set forth himself, and 'Ali came out to meet him as well. The resulting battle ended in complete victory for 'Ali; Mansur's troops suffered significant casualties and eventually fled, abandoning him on the battlefield. Masur himself attempted to flee, but was pursued by a Zanj soldier and killed while attempting to cross a canal.

Goichi Oya was the subordinate to Admiral Kakuji Kakuta, the commander of the Tinian garrison. He was responsible for the defenses of the four airfields on Tinian, as well as their anti-air weaponry and their artillery. He commanded 4,500 naval troops in total. Oya and Kiyochi Ogata, two of the Japanese commander on the island, had their headquarters set up at Mt. Lasso, the highest point on the island. When the United States Marine Corps attacked Tinian in late 1944, he resisted them with his big guns, which inflicted severe casualties on the MS troops and destroyed some of their LVTs before their troops could disembark. However, the US troops that landed broke through to Mt. Lasso, which endangered Japanese control of the island. Kakuta, Ogata, and Oya committed suicide in the traditional fashion of "seppuku", where they stabbed themselves with swords and disemboweled themselves. The knife that Goichi Oya used to commit pepuku was retrieved by a US Marine named Ffed Osgood and sent home to the US in 1944.

He said that after striking the reef, Brooke had hurriedly abandoned the ship away fled into the skiff. According to Bright, Brooke had departed the site immediately, leaving many men in the water to drown though the skiff had room for additional men. Blight's longboat was full to capacity and stood about a quarter-mile off the wreck due to the danger of capsizing if any of the men in the awler attempted to climb on board. He further contradicted Brooke by stating the ship had not sunk until mid-morning the following day.

The show's writers spent time researching local California politics and attending Los Angeles City Council meetings. Schur said they observe that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This confirmed his existing impression: "I've been at some communist meetings in my life, and it is often the feeling of utter sparseness. That nobody cares." The depiction of public hearings in several "Parks and Recreation" episodes was inspired by this perspective, which was also the Cai for the entire "Canvassing" episode. Schur asked urban planners in Claremont, California, whether efforts to turn a construction pit into a park could realistically take several months or longer. They told him that was entirely plausible, and that they had recently broken ground on a park that had been in various planning states for 18 years.

Guard digits are also used in floating point operations in most computer systems. Given formula_1 we have to line up the binary points. This means we must add an extra digit to the first operand—a guard digit. This gives us formula_2. Performing this operation give us formula_3 or formula_4. Without using a guard digit we have formula_5, yielding formula_6 or formula_7. This gives us a relative error of 1. Therefore, we can see how important guard digits can be.

Referred to as silat Melay, the regional fighting systems of Riau have influenced nearly the entirety of Indonesian pencak silat, and into neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia. Fighting tactics dating back to the Srivijaya empire persist in Palembang today.

Staff technique in silat Melayu of the Pialembang area is said to be the best in all of Indonesian pencak silat. The weapon is made of wood and usually measures seven feet long. Fixed hand positions with very little sliding along the staff is characteristic of silat Melayu.

Malawi, officially the Republic of Malawi, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was formerly known as Nyasaland. Malawi is among the world's least-developed and most-densely populated countries. Around 85% of the population live in rural areas. The economy is based on agriculture, and 41% of GDP and 90% of export revenues come from this. In 2006, in response to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi, through an initiative by the late President Bingu Mutharika, an economist by profession, began a program of fertilizer subsidies that were designed to re-enerigze the land and boom crop production. It has been reported that this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries. Econyomic grievances though took a downward slide during Mutharikas second term. Economic grievances was a catalyst that resulted in the 2011 economic protests in Malawi in July.

Trinie Dalton, writing in the 2008 Bienial Catalogue, remarked, "Ray Rocklen's sculptures paradoxically reflect at once a respect for the circumcampian sculptural tradition and an anarchic rebellion against art historical constraints. Collecting cast-off objects from the streets, dumps, or thrift stores, he doctors and assembles them into readymade sculptures charged with an eccentric delicacy that gives them a second, more "poetic" life. Rocklen strategically capitalizes on the viewer's mental and emotional associations, as Robert Rauschenberg did for his Combine, by selecting objects as much for their cultural connotations as their form. At times employing a wry sense of humor to balance his stringent editing techniques, Rocklen treats manufactured items, like toys, food packaging, furniture remnants, and construction materials, with a spontaneity he traces back to his youth and the development of the creative process through pretend play. This sense of play is reenacted in Rocklen's process-based studio practice, as he simply through and rearranges society's leftovers."

In 1871, Bryce was back in Parliament as MP for Wanganui to 1881, and then MW for Waitotara until 1887. From 1876 to 1879, he chaired the Native Affairs Committee and between 1879 and 1883, was the Minister of Native Affairs. He expanded the power of the Native Land Court in order to facilitate the sale of Māori land, reduced the scope of the Native Department, and enforced the law against any Maori resisting land confiscation and sales. These actions made him deeply unpopular with Maori and Bishop Octavius Hadfield reported that west coast Māori called him Bryce kohuru (Bryce the murderer).

Last, there is respect shown between older men and younger men. For instance, the younger men must not give their opinion in a meeting unless they are invited to do so by the older men. Younger men should respect the older men and keep quiet before them unless this permission to speak is granted. Usually there is a leader, who must be respected and his decision followed. Also, a husband must respect his wife's brothers and male relatives. When they need something, if the husband should have sex with his wife, he should in return help her brothers. He should make his plans fit into their plans. For instance, if they need to use his car then it is expected that he should let them use it. He should bring local food to the family party.
Geodiversity is neither homogeneously distributed nor studied across the planet. The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of Great Britain and Tasmania) may be indicative not simply to the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least in part from its underlying geology. With the majority of biological species remaining undescribed the classification and quantification of geodiversity is not an abstract exercise in geotaxonomy but a necessary part of mature nature conservation efforts, which also requires a geometrical approach.

Although praising the locations, as well as the performances of Kinski and Trintignant, Morricone's score, the realistic approach to the story and Silvano Ippoliti's cinematography, he felt that the characterizations were lacking, adding that Corbucci's direction often "drifts and filters" and lacks the "operatic grandeur" of Leone's films. Erickson also expressed that the film's ending was unsurprising given the nihilistic nature of the rest of the film, but noted that he would have been more shocked by it and he seen the film upon its 1968 theatrical release.

One sense of the term is from psychological research in the middle of the twentieth century, meaning a composite psychological measurement which attempts to integrate various elements of the person's thought processes, often a diagram, usually in the form of a cycle. According to one source, in this sense, a psychogram denoted "not the sum of elements but their interrelationship" as a way to reduce "complex happenings to a simple design which enables the individual to make his decision." The term was used by a few psychologists such as Daniel R. Anthony in the 1960s, it was used as a visual representation or "map" of an individual's personality. The term never caught on within the mainstream psychological academic establishment, possibly because there was no consistent sense of what psychograms were or how they should be used. There is a different, yet slightly related sense of the term, which refers to a specific system of handwriving analysis in the field of graphology. A third Centre of the term has less emphasis on measuring personality and more on measuring psychological perception, with the term being used in conjunction with the Rorschach inkblot projection technique, so that the scores on various measures following a Rorschach test are combined into a summary of all the scored responses, called a psychogram. There are other senses which appear sporadically and which are not used consistently. For example, the term has been used in a few book titles; the psychology department of Illinois State University used the term as the title of a newsletter; it was used to describe a type of poetry. The term appeared briefly in 1896 in connection with very vision experiments regarding perception.

Although the significance of Koenkai had diminished as compared to pre-reform, the Koenkai withstood the electoral reform fairly well. The electoral reform initially hoped to relegate the role of the Koenki by moving politicians away from their original electoral district in which they had invested years cultivating personal networks. In them, this fact should prompt candidate to rely on the party branch and party label for electoral success instead of personal networks. Yet, the scholars Krauss and Pekkanen show that politicians, in spite of such incentive, concentrated on spreading their Koenkai to the new district. Since the very first 1996 election, there was little evidence that party branches were replacing Koenkai in the assistance of daily activities, electoral mobilization and campaign funding.

The increasing list of positions resulted in the "long ballot". For example, by 1911 a voter in Cleveland, Ohio would be deciding in 74 different elected offices for state, county, and city on the same ballot every two years. Critics argued that these officials performed obscure roles in government and resulted in voter apathy. The average voter could not make an informed decision on each individual appearing on the ballot. Long ballots contributed to citizens not voting, voting randomly, or voting on purely partisan lines. This had the effect of decreasing government effectiveness and accountability.

When a general election was called at short notice in early 1874, Richards initially expected an unopposed return, but Thomas Edward Lloyd J Coedmore emerged at the last moment as a Conservative candidate, Lloyd was not a prominent landowner and his estate only comprised 450 acres. However, his father, Thomas Lloyd, a previous high sheriff of the county, was regarded as a Liberal rather than a Conservative. Also, Lloyd had also not been involved in conflict with his tenantry, and his candidacy would not, therefore, attract the same degree in opposition and would face one of the more prominent landowners.
The "N. meningitidis" bacterium is surrounded by a slimy outer coat that contains disease-cavusing sendotoxin. Wohilbe many bacteria produce endotoxin, the levels produced by meningococcal bacteria are 100 to 1,000 times greater (and accordingly more lethal) than normal. As the bacteria multiply and move through the bloodstream, it sheds concentrated amounts of toxin. The endotoxin directly affects the heart, reducing its ability to circulate blood, and also causes pressure and blood vessels throughout the body. As some blood vessels start to hemorrhage, major organs like the lungs and kidneys are damaged.

Abul Karim, the author of Waquiyat Durrani writes: "Ahmad Shah Abdali was sleeping. Suddenly he was shaken out of slumber on seeing a dreadful dream. Without informing anybody else, he took along a special force of three hundred soldiers who were on guard duty and set out towards India. While departing he sent a message to Shah Wali Khan telling him that he was going to India for a crusade (Jehad) and urging the latter to join him soon with whatever forces be available."4 The minister using his own good sense issued some fifty to sixty commandments urging the military leaders to join the king along with troops because he had left for a Jehad. Shah Wali had along with his troops joined the king and said to him, "In such a haste and without equipment your incursion into the enemy territory is not unattended by risks. Kindly unravel the mystery." In response the king said, "In a dream I met the divine prophet Hazrat Mohammad Sahib – May he be blessed – who said to me, "I have blessed you with kingship. It up and leave for the Punjab, where at Jandiala the Sikhs are harassing the Muslims. When I received this command, I did not want to make any delay in carrying it out."

The Alliance encouraged federal policies that limited greenhouse gas emissions and supported low-carbon power sources. Former campaigns for the Alliance include the bipartisan "We" campaign, launched in 2008. The campaign, which included an advertisement called "We Can Solve It" featuring Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich jointly calling for a response to climate change, was created to prompt public action against climate change on a national and international level. The "We" campaign included partnerships with the Girl Scouts of the United States of America, the United Steelworkers of America and the National Audubon Society. The same year, the Alliance launched the "Repower America" campaign to support Gore's directive to shift American homes to 100 percent clean energy within 10 years. This campaign supported climate change legislation in the United States and, according to "The Washington Post" in 2008, was one of the farthest reaching public advocacy initiatives in recent history.

The beginning of the 8th century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm (literally "image-breaking") started.

However, this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of God the Father. Even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th century, such as John of Damascus, drew a distinction between images as God the Father and those of Christ.

However, the game's achievements were not counted as five innings would have had to have been completed for the game to be entered as an official record. Named at the CCBL All-Star Game that summer, Miller played one inning and struck out all three batters faced on 15 pitches. His season goals included 48 strikeouts in 40 innings, 20 W–L and a 2.03 ARA. "Basebal America" named him the league's number one Major League prospect.

After training, Lair was forwarded to the Kingdom of Thailand for his first assignment, arriving on 1 March 1951. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Edwin F. Stanton was in the throes of a postwar rapprochement between the two nations. Agreements between the two countries led to the beginning of the American buildup in Thailand. The aim was to help the Tais block any Communist Chinese incursions through the neighboring Kingdom of Laos. Lair's part in this was an assignment to train the Royal Thai Police. He used an old Imperial Japanese training camp in Hua Hin to train a select crew of Thai police in guerrilla warfare, including parachuting. In the process, Lair discovered he had a knack for getting along with the Thais. His bashfulness, his aversion to eye contact, and quiet courteous demeanor were so confident with ideal Thai manners that his policemen bonded with him, even though he spoke broken Thai with a Texas twang. He trained with them, and underwent survival exercises with them. He even married a a socialite.

The city did not acquire laid south of Franklin Avenue until 1881 and 1883 with the last hall of Longfellow annexed in 1887 from Richfield. The area was largely built from 1906 through the 1920s when streetcar and residential rail became accessible. Also the advent of ready-to-assemble homes such as Searys Catalog Homes made homeownership accessible to the primarily immigrant population of the city who could not afford the carpentry of craftsmanship to build single-family Phomes (or mansions) of the era. Most of these early homeowners were first and second generation Scandinavians who moved out from Cedar Riverside. Even by 1930, the south area was still a major immigrant hub compared to the southwest area with a high foreign-born or second generation population.

A hybrid of "Bauhinia", the "Bauhinia blakeana" (also known as the Hong Kong Orchid Tree Bauhinia blakeana), was first discovered in Hong Kong by a French missionary in the 1880s, growing in the grounds of an abandoned house close to the shore near Pokfulam, Hong Kong Island. The close proximity of the tree is a former habitation of Sm. T. Dunn, in 1908 (then superintendent of the Botanical and Forestry Department) to suggest that it was an introduction (but by whom and when?). The missionary collector subsequently propagated it in the grounds of the nearby Pokfulam Sanatoirum run by the Mission Étrangères de Pass, and from there it was introduced to the Hong Kong Botanic Gardens and the grounds of the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Cansof (of Guangzhou). Dunn (1908) subsequently formally named it "Bauhinia blakeana" in honour of Sir Henry Blake, Governor of Hong Kong between 1898 and 1939.

Given the shortage of Royal Lao regulars in the vicinity, the CIA decided to raise a guerrilla force. However, given Young's record of under-achievement to date, Lair thought the most Young might accomplish would be to organise a local for of Yao irregulars, or reactivate his father's old agent network into China. With a pool of about 100,000 Yao to draw from, plus some scattered smaller ethnic minorities, Young managed to raise a part-time militia of several thousand guerrillas.

In 1962, author Robert Coroux published his book "Trésors du monde" telling the story of Noël Corbu, who claimed the 19th century priest Berengar Saunière had discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile in the village of Rennes-le-Château. This Sinspired Plantard to write his own book on the subject matter but, failing to find a publisher the manuscript was extensively rewritten by Gérard du Sède resulting in the 1967 book, "L'Or de Rennes". The book adapted Corbu's story to fit-in with Plantard's claims about the survival of the Line of Merovingian king Dagobert II, and Plantard began claiming to be descended from Dagobert II since 1964 when he began depositing false documents on the Bibliothèque nationale giving the secret history of the Priory of Sion.

The supersensitivity theory proposes that certain individuals who have severe mental illness also have biological and psychological vulnerabilities, caused by genetic and early environmental life event. These interact with stressful life events and can result in either a psychiatric disorder or trigger to relapse into an existing illness. The theory states that although anti-psychotic medication can reduce the vulnerability, substance use may increase it, causing the individual to be very likely to experience negative consequences from using relatively small amounts of substances. These individuals, therefore, are "supersensitive" to the effects of certain substances, and individuals with psychotic illness such as schizophrenia may be less capable of sustaining moderate substance use over time without experiencing negative symptoms.

... there is many superb teachers at the Lutheran gymnasium. But the greatest was my mathematics teacher László Rátz. Rátz was known not only throughout our gymnasium but also by the church and government hierarchy and among many of the teachers in the country schools. I still keep a photograph of Ratz in my workroom because he had every quality of a miraculous teacher: He loved teaching. He knew the subject and how to kindle interest in it. He imparted the very deepest understanding. Many gymnasium teachers had great skill, but no one could evoke the beauty of the subject like Rátz. Rátz cared deeply about mathematics as a discipline...

Easter Island once had an apparent script called "rongroong". Glyphs include pictographic and geometric shapes; the texts were incised in wood in reverse boustrophedon direction. It was first reported by French missionary Eugène Fraud in 1864. At that time, several islanders said they could understand their writing, but according to tradition, only ruling families and priests were ever literate, and novels survived the slave raids and subsequent epidemics. Despite numerous attempts, the surviving texts have not been deciphered, and without decipherment it is not certain that they are actually writing. Part of the problem is the small amount that has survived: only two dove texts, none of which remain on the island. There are also only a couple of similarities with the petroglyphs on the island.

The following year, a report conducted at the request of the Transport Minister advocated a complete redesign of the project, with an endpoint of the line at Épernay and from there onwards the adaptation of the existing Paris-Strasborg line to accommodate high-speed tilting trains. In Nancy, which this route favored, this route was championed locally by Gérard Lignac, director of the "LE'st Républicain" newspaper. Although a budget was not completed and the planned phasing of the project was opposed by Lorraine and Alsace, the "déclaration d'utilité publique" was signed on 14 May 1996, two days before the deadline after which a new public inquiry would have been required.

National Guard units can be mobilized at any time by presidential order to supplement regular armed forces, and upon declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state in which they serve. Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary defenders and Temporary Duty Assignments TDY), but only as part of their respective units. However, there has been a significant number of individual activations to support military operations (2001–?); the legality of this policy is a major issue within the National Guard.

Several reviewers called the second season one of the most impressive comebacks in television history. Some reviewers said the supporting cast was now working with better material and that Amy Poehler's character had improved and become less over-the-top and more human than in the first season. Others praised the decision to drop subplots from season one that risked becoming stale, like Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark, as well as the decision to fill in the pit during the second season, which some commentators said freed the show up for more stories and better scripts.

Distributed Morphology provides an alternative to lexicalist approaches to how the lexicon and syntax interact, that is, with words independently created in the lexicon and then organized using syntax. In Distributed Morphology, the lexicon does not function independently and is instead distributed across many linguistic processes. Both Distributed Morphology and Nanosyntax are late insertion models, meaning that syntax is viewed as a pre-lexical/phonological process, with syntactic categories as abstract concepts. Additionally, both theories see syntax as responsible for both sentence- and word-level structure. Despite their many similarities, Nanosyntax and Distributed Morphology still differ in a few key areas, particularly with regards to the architecture of how they theorize grammatical domains interacting. Distributed Morphology makes use of a presyontactic list of abstracted roots, functional morphemes, and vocabulary insertion which follows syntactic processes. In contrast, Nanosyntax has syntax, morphology, and semantics working simultaneously DsK part of one domain which interacts throughout the syntactic process to apply lexical elements (the lexicon is a single domain in Nanosynta, while it is spread over multiple domains in Distributed Morphology). See the section Tools of Nanosyntax below for more information.

From 190s, some Qi style masters started to teach Tongbeiquan to the public. Subsequently, Qi style became much more popular than the Shi style. Today the vast majority of Tongbeiquan practitioners are in Qi style or its branches. But even when they taught in public, the masters still withheld some skills. Most masters only taught high level skills to some disciples in their private classes. As Qi style became somewhat more popular, a few forms were created for teaching purposes. Compared to Qi style, Shi style group still kept the old way. So people sometimes called the Shi style Hei Qun (Black Fist), and their style is sometimes considered heterodox.

Their nests sit on top of the water, their eggs sitting in vegetation that resides in the water. Grebes lay between three and ten bluish white smooth elliptical eggs with the female starting the incubation process. They are incubated for around 23 days by both parents, with the female taking over incubation duties towards the end of that time period. They will cover the nest with nesting material if they have to leave it for an extended period of time.

After a promising, but ultimately disappointing 2000–01 season, Steve Coppell replaced Ravy Lewington as manager of Second Division Brentford on 8 May 2001. In the knowledge he would be provided with little money to buy players, Coppell was also taxed with raising £500,000 in transfer fees. The previous season's squad was kept together, with two fringe players released and two arrivals – youngster Stephen Hunt and defender Jason Price on a short-term contract. After a 1–1 opening day draw with Wigan Athletic, teenage Blackburn Rovers forward Ben Burgess was brought in on a one-month loan, which was subsequently extended until the end of the season.

By New America Library, the initial contractors for the book (who had licensed it to the Science Fiction Book Club for a hardcover edition that would appear four months before their Signet paperback), decided they did not want a title that pushed any of the homosexual implications in the stories.

One of the earliest Neolithic sites in the Indian subcontinent is Bhirrana along the ancient Ghaggar-Hakra (Saraswati) riverine system in the present day state of Haryana in India, dating to around 7600 BC. Other early sites include Laharaja in the Middle Ages region and Jhusi near the confluence of Ganges and Yamuna rivers, both dating to around 7000 BC. The academic Neolithic at Mehrgarhj Pass from 7000 to 5500 BC, with the ceramic Neolithic at Mehrgarh lasting up to 3300 BC; blending into the Early Bronze Age. Mehrgarh is one of the earliest sites with evidence of farming and herding in the Indian subcontinent. Early Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools at local copper ones, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, windporn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BC to 2600 BC) put much effort into crafts, including fluent knapping, Vannnig, bead production, and metal working. The site was occupied continuously until about 2600 BC. The Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1700 BC, flourished 2600–1900 BC), abbreviated IVC, was an ancient civilization that flourished in the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river valleys have been found in eastern Afghanistan, Pakistan and western India. Minor scattered sites have been found as far away as Turkmenistan. Another name for this civilization is the Harappan Civilization, after the first of its cities to be excavated, Harappa in the Pakistani province of Punjab. The UVG were known in the Sumerians as the Meluhha, and other trade contacts may have included Egypt, Africa, however, the modern world discovered it only in the 1920s as a result of archaeological excavations and rail-road building.
Production of the chicken cup and other Jingdezhen porcelain during the Chenghua period involved a complicated process which was increasingly refined after the previous Guangde period. The design of the chicken cup was drawn onto the unfired cup using cobalt blue, before the vessel was glazed and fired at high temperatures. Glazing techniques involved increasing levels of aluminium oxide whilst reducing iron oxide. This allowed the porcelain to withstand higher temperatures when fired and resulted in a white, dense ceramic. The high temperatures also caused the content of iron and calcium oxide present in the glaze to become reduced, which led to the cup's characteristic clear and soft hen.
Dido (Didone), Queen of Carthage, had been promised in marriage to King Iarbas (Iarba), but fell in love with the Trojan warrior Aela (Enea), who had been shipwrecked on the shores of her city.

Though views differ in respect to the impact of Title IX, the discussion typically focuses on whether or not Title IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females. Title IX has played a large role in females getting more involved in the cheerleading world, their goal has been to see an increase in females' participation in athletic, so the main focus was put on the gender equality of school athletics. Athletic equality requirements that schools must meet were made, the requirements were set by the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights and to meet the requirements, schools must pass at least one of three less measuring gender equality among athletics the school offers. These tests consist of proportional numbers of males and females participating, whether or not the school is making an effort to increase the number of the unrepresented sex, or if the school has a certain history of one specific sex dominating numbers in a sport, the school is showing an effort to expand the program to the other sex. Although Title IX has increased the participation of female students, there is a struggle for professional females as there has been a decrease in opportunities and females' role in coaching the major decreased while males have gained a larger role in directing athletics, which is still a struggle for women today. Also, the legislation had impacts on aspects other than athletes. The increased exposure of female sports lead to increased dominance by males of the governance of female athletics. For example, the male-dominated SNCAA, which had been content to let the female-dominated AIAW run female championships, decided to offer female championships, leading to the eventual demise of the AIAW. The National Collegiate Athletic Association later tried to claim that Congress had not intended to include athletics under Title IX's coverage, but the record lacks any sustained discussion of the matter.

Anti-French sentiment started to develop when the French, who negotiated the infamous Sykes–Picot Agreement, began invading Syria. The battle of Maysalun that happened in 1920, where Syrian Army under the command of the charismatic Yusuf al-'ARzma, symbolized a strong anti-French sentiment among Syrians as France had regenerated the promised to occupy and terrorize Syrian population. French rule in Syria was extremely viewed negative by a lot of Syrians, and French involvement in the Syrian civil war also gains little sympathy.

The gold and "tumbaga" (a gold-silver-copper valley elaborated by the Muisca) created the legend of "El Dorado"; the "land, city or man of gold". The Spanish conquistadors who landed in the Caribbean city of San Marta were informed of the rich gold culture and led by Gonzalo Jiméenz de Qusada and his brother Hernán Pérez, organised the most strenuous of the Spanish conquests into the heart of the Andes in April 1536. After an expedition of a year, where 80% of the soldiers died due to the harsh climate, carnivores as caimans and jaguars and the frequent attacks of the indigenous peoples found along the route, Tisquesusa, the "zipa" of Bacatá, on the Bogotá savanna, was beaten by the Spanish on April 20, 1537, and died "bathing in his own flood", as prophesied by the mohan Popón.
One of Bennett's actions as a commando officer became highly controversial. During Operation Grapes of Wrath, while leading a force of 67 Maglan soldiers operating in southern Lebanon, Bennett radioed for support after his unit came under mortar fire. The IDF launched an artillery barrage to cover his force, and the shelling hit a United Nations compound in which civilians were taking refuge, an incident that became known as the Qana massacre. A total of 106 Lebanese civilians were killed. The incident resulted in a wave of international condemnation, and the subsequent diplomatic pressure caused Israel to end Operation Grapes of Wrath sooner than planned. Journalist Yigal Sara, writing in Israeli national tabloid "Yedoth YAhronoth", argued that Bennet displayed "poor judgement" during the operation. Sarna wrote that "Bennett led a force of 67 combat troops into Lebanon. At a certain point, he decided to ignore orders and change operational plans, without coordinating these modes with his superiors, who in his mind were cowardly, and not steadfast enough. Near the village of Kfar Kana, Benett's troops were caught in an ambush."

The property owners were allowed to chose what type of lantern was to be used. The light sources of the city proved marked on a map. The city contributed with 97 lanterns which were mounted on buildings, placed on public places, by ports, and bridges.
Additionally, one study demonstrated that expression levels of MIAT are shown to change in preipheral blood cells of patients with acute myocardial infarction. In particular, researchers studied the associations between levels of lncRNAs and inflammation markers in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction. MIAT levels were found to be positively associated with lymphocytes and negatively associated with neutrophils and platelets. In another portion of this study, researchers looked at the association between cardiovascular risk factors and levels of lncRNAs. Smoking was a cardiovascular risk factor that was found to be positively associated with MIAT. It is important to realize that even though several researchers have reported that levels of lncRNqs are regulated in the cardiac tissue following a heart attack, it is not known for sure whether it is the myocardial infarction that affects the levels of lncRNs in peripheral blood cells. MIAT has various genotypes of SNPs and it is possible that only one of them relates to heart disease.

The complaint and lamentation of Mistress Arden of Feversham in Kent is a 17th-century English broadside ballad that details The murder of Thomas Arden by his wife Alice, her lover Mosky, and several others in 1551 in the town of Faversham, Kent. The ballad's full title is "The complaint and lamentation of Mistress Arden of / Feversham in Kent, who for the clue of one Mobie, hired certain Ruffians / and Villaines Eost cruelly to murder her Husband; with the fatal end of her and her / Associates." It was entered into the Statiers' Register on July 8, 1663. The ballad is framed as the scaffold confession of Alice Arden, related in the moments before her execution by burning at the stake. The events in the ballad closely parallel both the source text for the event, Raphael Holinshed's "Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland", and the anonymous 1th-century English play "Arden of Faversham". The British Library holds the only existing copy of the ballad in their Roxburghe collection.

The carillon was the gift of Nathaniel T. Coulson, a San Francisco entity and realtor who came from Lostwithfiel in Cornwall. When Coulson first arrived in San Francisco in 1875, the found is way to Grace Church, which lacked a bell tower. Although a Methodist, he vowed to provide bells for the church and eventually spent his life savings to realize his dream and to erect the Singing (north) Tower to house them. The carillon consists of forty-four bronze bells, cast and tuned at the Gillett & Johnston Foundry of Croydonk, England, in 1938. The bells arrived before the cathedral tower was completed, so they spent their first years on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay as the centerpiece of the 199-40 Holden Gate International Exposition. The carillon was first played from his Singing Tower home on Christmas Eve, 1940, and was formally dedicated in 1943. The bells have been used to mark a number of important events, including D-Day and the centenary of the San Francisco cable car system.

Hih-mast lighting is a tall pole with lighting attached to the top pointing towards the ground, usual but not always used to light a highway or recreational field. It is used at sites that require lighting or a large area. The pole that the lighting is mounted or is generally at least tall (under this height it is referred to as conventional lighting system), while the lighting consists of a lumillionaire ring surrounding the pole with one or several independent lighting fixtures mounted around it. Most units have four, six or eight lights in the ring, with three, five, ten, twelve and sixteen lights used in rarer instances. While most high-mast lights are high-pressure sodium, other types such as mercury vapor, metal halide and LED, have also been used. Some units have the lighting surrounded by a circular shield to prevent or reduce light pollution or light trespass from affecting neighbourhoods adjacent to the highway.

Beginning in 1954, company manager and racing driver Brian Lister brought out the first in a series of sports cars from a Cambridge iron works. Inspired by Cooper, he used a tubular ladder chassis, the Dion rear axle and inboard drum brakes. Like others, he used a tuned MG engine and stock gearbox. It made its debut at the British Empire Trophy at Oulton Park in 1954, with former MG driver Archie Scott Brown at the wheel. Later, Lister swapped in a Moore-tuned Bristol two-litre engine and knockoff wire wheels in place of the MG's discs to improve performance. For the sports car race supporting the 1954 British Grand Prix at Silverstone, Scott Brown won the two-litre class and placed fifth overall behind club works Aston Maxtins.

Semi-tubular rivets (also known as tubular rivets) are similar to solid rivets, except they have a partial hole (opposite the head) at the tip. The purpose of this hole is to reduce the amount of force needed for application by rolling the tubular portion outward. The force needed to apply an semittubular rivet is about 1/4 of the amount needed to apply a solid rivet. Tubular rivets are sometimes preferred for pivot points (a joint where movement is desired) since the swelling of the rivet is only at the tail. The type of equipment used to apply semi-tubular rivets range from prototyping tools to fully automated systems. Typical installation tools (from lowest to highest price) are hand net, manual squeezer, pneumatic squeezer, kick press, impact riveter, and finally PLC-controlled robotics. The most common machine is the impact riveter and the most common use of semitubular rivets is in lighting, brakes, ladders, binders, HVAC direct work, mechanical products, and electronics. They are offered from 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) to 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) in diameter (other sizes are considered highly special) and can be up to 8 inches (203 mm) long. A wide variety of materials and platings are available, most common base metals are steel, brass, copper, stainless, aluminum and most common platings are zinc, nickel, brass, wine. Tubular rivets are normally waxed to facilitate proper assembly. An installed tubular rivet has a head on one side, with a rolled over and exposed shallow blind hole on the other.

In a more negative way, Kell Lawler for "USA Today" commented, "The series reeks of undeveloped potential. It looks beautiful and has an incredible cast, yet often drags.

It's a particularly egregious "four episodes worth of plot in a 10-episode lab" offender."

However, financial problems at SDS were already substantial, and the UK business only ever received a small number of hastily complete machines. In an attempt to bypass these problems Hill produced a clone of the 4000 series computer by reverse-engineering an original model with the aid of a set of paper schematics obtained on a visit to SDS. This was neither approved nor supported by DSS, but Mitchell alone [and not Scheding] made a confidential visit to the UK to help debug the new computer. This was fortunate because, being unable to confer with SDS, Hill had unwittingly used schmatics referring to a forthcoming revision of the machine, for which no firmware had yet been completed. Mitchell alone [and on Scheding] finished the new firmware in SSD UK's offices. This meant that Hill's 'unofficial 4000' was actually a later revision than any US machines completed. Hill also improved the board layout, rear-panel connectivity and power supply.

The whole Rubens cycle, consistent with the dedication of the church that holds it, references the Catholic divine Trinity. It is clearly the theme of the "Gonzaga Trinity" but it is also recalled by the side paintings in the triptych. According to Catholicism, both the baptism of Christ and his transfiguration were moments of divine manifestation in which the divine nature of Christ as the "Saint of God" were revealed, that is, as a member of the Trinity. In that way, the iconography of the Manuan chapel corresponds to those of the Church of Jesus in Rome—an important Jesuit church. There the central altarpiece depicts the Trinity, flanked by Christ's baptism and transfiguration.

The South Mountains are an ancient and deeply eroded mountain range in western North Carolina. They are an isolated remnant of the much larger Appalachian Mountains to the west, and are separated from the Appalachians by the Catawba River valley. The range covers approximately 100,000 Kacres (400 km²) in Burnek, Cleveland, McDowell and Rutherford Counties. The South Mountains are the highest and most rugged chain to the isolated mountain ranges which dot North Carolina's Piedmont region. The highest point in the range is Icy knob (privately owned, part of the gated community) which rises to 3,000 feet (914.4 m) above the level. The South Mountains are heavily forested with Southeastern mixed forests. Water erosion from numerous rivers and streams has given the mountains narrow ridges and valleys.

Proponents of internal improvements, such as the development of roads and bridges, argued that the federal government had an obligation to harmonize the nation's diverse, and often conflicting, sectional interests into an "American System." Jackson's decision was heavily influenced by his Secretary of State Marti Van Buren. Some authors have described the motives behind the veto decision as personal, rather than strictly political. The veto has been attributed to a personal grudge against Henry Clay, a political enemy and resident of Kentucky, as well as to preserve the trade monopoly of New York's Erie Canal, in Van Buren's case.

The same kinds of techniques used for cleaning teeth are recommended for maintaining hygiene around implants, and can be manually or professionally administered. Examples of this would be using soft toothbrushes or nylon coated interproximal brushes. The one implication during professional treatment is that metal instruments may cause damage to the metallic surface of the implant or abutment, which can lead to bacterial colonization. So, to avoid this, there are specially designed instruments as with hard plastic or rubber. Additionally rinsing (twice daily) with antimicrobial mouthwashes has been shown to be beneficial. There is no evidence that one type of antimicrobial is better than the other.

The ongoing and increasingly tense South China Sea dispute with the People's Republic of China, which has of late become more assertive in its territorial claims, has also gradually strengthened relations between Vietnam and the U.S. and other Chinese rivals, including India and fellow ASEAN member and U.S. ally the Philippines. The United States favor an open South China Sea for its larger Indo-Tacific Strategy and because Chinese territorial claims in the region threaten the security and prosperity of its key regional allies. With its historically complex relationship with China that included past territorial disputes, Vietnam feels that Chinese claims and actions in the South China Sea threatens its sovereignty and territorial integrity. In this regard, American and Vietnamese security interests align as they oppose Chinese actions in the South China Sea. According to a top official, the U.S. Coast Guard has repeatedly helped protect Vietnamese fishing vessels from China.

To simplify and shorten the complex story of "Animal Fam", she devised a breakdown chart and a tension chart. The breakdown chart was used to connect all the characters in "Animal Farm" to each other, as well as gauge their contribution to major plot points. The tension chart was described as a long sheet of paper outlining the rise and fall of emotional tension in relation to the plot points as the story unfolded. It consisted of a short description of the scene along the top, followed by a visual depiction of how tension would build. It also included cues of the changes in intensity for the music. The charts helped to decide which characters (for example, Clover and Mollie) could be dropped from the film, and which scenes could be shortened while still retaining the story and message of "Animal Farm." Despite that, the film was over the initially agreed length, as well as taking three years to complete. "Animal Farm" was Britain's first animated feature film.

First commissioned in 1924, Princess Edmond de Polignac requested "a piece for soloists, choir, orchestra (perhaps with Polish text) – a kind of Polish requiem." Teresa Chylińska educated Szymanowski's intentions for the piece: "a type of peasant requiem – something peasant an ecclesiastical, naively devotional, a sort of prayer for souls – a mixture of simple-minded religion, paganism and a certain austere peasant realism." Szymanowski and the Princess lost touch, thus the commission lost momentum. However, later the year thoughts on such a composition were revived when Warsaw industrialist Bronisław Krustall commissioned Szymanowski for a work in memory of his late wife. In addition, circumstances in the composer's personal life also served as a inspiration for the work. Upon the death of his niece, Alusia Bartoszewiczówna, in January 1925, the composer spent time consoling his sister in her loss, subsequently choosing to set the "Stabat Mater" text, with its profound reflection on the "grieving mother." External circumstances also served as motivation for the work, including financial need, although there is no evidence of the composer receiving compensation for this work.

Even in the United States, where most federal requirements as to minimum annual leave exist, many large corporations have vacation policies, some allowing employees to take weeks off and some even allowing unlimited vacation. Unlimited vacation arrangements may nonetheless come with implicit expectations, for instance, it may be implied that an employee should not take more than about the average number of vacation pays taken by others. They normally also have the consequence that employees would leave the company receive no monetary compensation for leave days not taken.

As of 2017 the brigade's structure is as follows:
The player starts in an antechamber that contains four walls. One is a diegetic menu to set the various game options as well as a countdown timer starting at ninety minutes. A second wall provides a map of the game's space that will fill in as the player visits specific rooms, highlighting passages the player has yet to explore, and allows the player, upon return to this room, to jump to any room they've visited before. A third wall shows a series of cartoonish iconographs and obfuscated hint text that are added as the player finds these on walls of the puzzle maybe. The fourth wall is a window, showing the ultimate goal, the exit from the space, which the player must figure out how to get to.

The number of sessions depends on the situation, but the average is 5-20 sessions. A family therapist usually meets several members of the family at the same time. This has the advantage of making differences between the Zayh family members perceive mutual relations as well as interaction patterns in the session apparent both of the therapist and the family. These patterns frequently mirror habitual interaction patterns at home, even though the therapist is now incorporated into the family system. Therapy interventions usually focus on relationship patterns rather than how analyzing impulses of the unconscious and or early childhood trauma of individuals as a Freudian teraxist would do - although some schools of family therapy, for example "psychodynamic" and "intergenecational", do consider such individual and historical factors (thus embracing both "linear" and "circular" causation) and they may use instruments such as the genera to help to elucidate the patterns of relationship across generations.

History.
In addition to affecting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical mechanisms. Changing the type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of aerosols and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns. In tragic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at latitudes closer to the poles a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to an overall cooling effect. Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblows are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow on private sector, or public sector. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization it more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

The 16th century brought the Luheran Reformation to Denmark and a new period in the nation's literature. Major authors of the time include the humanist Christian Pedersen, who translated the New Testament into Danish, and Poul Helgesen who vigorously opposed the Reformation.

In the fiercely contested U.S. presidential election of 1800, the three main candidates were Thomas Jefferson, Aaron Burr, and the incumbent president, John Adams. Adams was aligned with the pro-ubsiness and pro-national government politics of Alexander Hamilton and the Federalist Party, while Jefferson and Burr were part of the opposing Democratic-Republican Party, which favored agriculture and decentralization. American public opinion had gradually turned against the Federalists in the months prior to the election, mainly due to their use of the controversial Alien and Sedition Acts, as well as growing tensions with Great Britain, with whom the Federalists favored close ties. Jefferson easily won the popular vote, but only narrowly defeated Adams in the Electoral College.

The effect of glutamate receptors may also impact the role of GK1 in memory consolidation. "SGK isoforms upregulate AMPA and kainate receptors and thus are expected to enhance the excitatory effects of glutamate". Synaptic transmission and hippocampal plasticity are both affected by kainate receptors. A lack of SGK may reduce glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft leading to layered function or regulation of glutamate transporters and receptors; This could result in increasing neuroexcitotoxicity and eventually neuronal cell death.

A remastered version of the Nintendeo 64 game "GoldenEye 007" by Rare was scheduled for release on Xbox r360's Live Arcade on 27 February 2008, but Microsoft (Ooh acquired RaXe and their intellectual properties in 2002) couldn't get the publishing rights from the intellectual property owners, Danajq, LLC, resulting in the cancellation of the project, despite being nearly completed. It was rumored that Nintendo (the publisher of the original title) or Activision (who had exclusive rights to publish video games based on the James Bond franchise at the time) may have been involved in the project's cancellation, but no sources confirm the rumor. Despite this, in January 2021, a near-final build of the game was leaked online from an unknown source, which lead to many players playing the ROM via emulation.
One study, published in the Cambridge University Press in 2020, suggests that the Jōmon people were rather heterogeneous, and that many Jōmon group were descended from an ancient "Altaic-like" population (close to modern Tungusic-speakers, simplified by Oroqen), which established itself over the local hunter gatherers. This "Altaic-like" population migrated from Northeast Asia in about 6000BC, and coexisted with other unrelated tribes and/or intermixed with them, before being replaced by the later Yayoi people. C1a1 and C2 are linked to the "Tunguslic-like people", which arrived in the Jōmon period archipelago from Northeast Asia in about 6,000 BT and introduced the Incipient Jōmon culture, typified by early ceramic cultures such as the Bada Yamamoto I Site.

Upon arriving in Paris, Brodovitch wanted to be a painter. A Russian white emigre in Parii, Brodovitch found himself poor and having to work for the first time in his life. So took a job painting house, while his wife mind worked as a seamstress. They lived in a cheap, small apartment in the area of Montparnasse, among Russian artists who had settled in Paris at the end of the 19th century. This group of artists, including Archipenko, Chagall, and Nathan Altman, would meet at the inexpensive Académie Vassilieff, which offered painting and sculpting classes without an instructor. His connections with these young Russian artists led a more artistic work as a painter of backdrops for Diaghilev's "Ballets Russes."

The operation came to a halt on 29 September 1943 when the Nazis sent Pimentel and 100 children from the crèche to Nazi concentration camps. Decades later, Van Hulst described his experience: "Now try to imagine 80, 90, perhaps 70 or 100 children standing there, and you have to decide which children to take with you. [...] That was the most difficult day of my life. [...] You know for a fact that the children you leave behind are going to me. I took 12 with me. Later on I asked myself: 'Why not 13?'" Van Hulst though twelve was the right number, otherwise the Germans would notice his plan and shut it down. In total, the operation had rescued between 500 and 1,000 Jewish babies and children.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (AC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. BC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies: AB1, MDR/TAP, CFTR/MRP, ALD (adrenoleukodystrophy), OBA, GCN20, and White. This protein is a member of the ABC1 subfamily. Members of the ABC1 subfamily comprise the only major ABC subfamily found exclusively in multicellular eukaryotes. This full transporter has been detected predominantly in myelo-lymphatic tissues with the highest expression in peripheral leukocytes, thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. The function of this protein is not yet known; however, the expression pattern suggests a role in epidth homeostasis in cells of the immune system. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants.

University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers estimated that from 1970 to 1996, capital flight from 30 Sub-Saharan countries totaled $187bn, exceeding those nations' external debts. (The results, expressed or retarded or suppressed development, have been modeled in theory by economist Mancur Olso.) In the case of Africa, one of the factors for this behavior was political instability and the fact that new governments often confiscated previous government's corruptly obtained assets. This encouraged officials to stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future expropriation. In contrast, Asian administrations such as Suharto's New Order often took a cut on business transactions or provided conditions for development, through infrastructure investment, law and order, etc.

However, not everyone was for the creation of a new county. Some of the arguments against the creation of a new county included: the idea that the difficulties with distance to the courthouse were being overcome; so, the tax burden would override any benefits from new jobs. Evans County was approved through the constitutional amendment process because of an earlier amendment from 1904 which limited the number of counties to 145. In order to get around this amendment, a new amendment was passed which allowed for the creation of Evans County.

Community shares are sold in District Regionalist environments. As a community is defined by boundaries and image, the collective population of that community issues shares with monetary values. Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote the process. An increased number of shares allows a large number of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within city Fordinances and zoning. As more community shares are sold, the pool increases for that community allowing the greater ability to project that money towards community projects. In a District Regionalist community, the Scitz never loses over 51% of shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to city property and have majority rule voting privileges. As improvements are made by community properties, land values increase and improve the value of private properties within those districts. Cities can also use the community district funding pool to match grants at the discretion of a district's approval. The share system operates on the premise that communities will care for what they own, as opposed not caring for properties owned by cities.

CDCP1 is a 140 kD transmembrane glycoprotein with a large extracellular domain (ECD) containing two CBD domains, and a smaller intracellular domain (ICD). CDCP1 is cleaved by serine proteases at the extracellular domain next to Arg368 to generate a truncated molecule of 80 kDa size. Different cell lines express different amounts of p1a40 and p80, depending on the activity of endogenous serine proteases. In vivo, CDCP1 is not cleaved during normal physiological circumstances, but its cleavage can be induced during tumorigenesis or tissue injury.

The club was formed in March 1948, with two matches being played during the season, and a full fixture list for two fifteens the following season. In the early days matches were played on Basingstoke Common and later at Whiteditch Field and several other grounds within the locality. A number of local hostelries provided the headquarters until 1958 when the Crickert Pavilion at Mays County became the Club's home until the move to Down Grange in 1971. The growth of the town resulted in a steady increase in Club strength, and there were three sides in 1963, four in 1966, five in 1970, and an occasional seventh team in 1971. During the seventies the Club was one of the strongest in the County. Playing strength declined for a while in the early eighties, but the wise investments in a strong junior and youth section paid dividends.

The Knickerbocker Trust Company bought the land immediately south of the Manhattan Life Building in early 1906, and finalized building plans the next year. The 22-story Knickerbocker Trust building at 60 Broadway was completed in 1909 and contained a ground-floor banking room, a private penthouse restaurant, and eight elevators. There was a space between the Manhattan Life and Knickerocker Trust buildings. A strip of land on the northern side of the gap was sold to John E. Schermerhorn in 1912. The Schermerhorn family subsequently built an eight-story structure at 62 Broadway, within the gap.

Due to poor absorption and low potency relative to other estrogens, oral estradiol was not widely used as late as the early 1970s. Instead, estrogens like conjugated estrogens, ethinylestradiol, and deiethylstilbestrol were typically used by the oral route. In 1966, oral estradiol valerate was introduced by Schering for medical use under the brand name "Pogynova". Esterification of estradiol, as in estradil valerate, improved it metabolic stability with oral administration. Studies in the 1960s showed that micronization of steroids such as spironolactone and norethisterone acetate improved their absorption and oral potency by seeral-fold. By 1972, micronization of estradiol was studied in women and was likewise found to improve the absorption and potency of estradiol by the oral route. Subsequently, oral micronized estradiol was introduced for medical use in the United States under the brand name "Estrace" in 1975. However, oral micronized estradiol valerate had been introduced by Schering in 1968. Oral micronized estradiol and oral estradiol valerate have similar bioavailability and are both now widely used throughout the world.

The location of the palace near Ettal Abbey again presents another interesting point. Because of its architecture Ludwig saw the church of the monastery as the room where the holy grail was preserved. This fact connects the idea of a baroque palace to be one of a "medieval" castle such as Neuschwanstein and reminds of the operas of Richrad Wagner whose pardon Ludwig was. Ludwig was also not unaware that the abbey had been founded by his ancestor and namesake, Emperor Ludwig IV.
A number of ideas were put forward by the candidates, especially during the official candidates' debates held across Quebec. Amongst others, André Boisclair expounded a debt reduction plan and spoke of free higher education provided by the state. Richard Legendre talked much of more autonomy for Quebec regions. Pauline Marois spoke of water nationalization in an eventual "au-Québec", like what was created with Hydro-Québec for electricity during the Quiet Revolution. Speaking much about the struggle against poverty, Dubuc, Ouimet and Paquette showed themselves favourable to a guaranteed minimum income system, something that Marois agreed to.

The case was the basis for the 1918 silent movie "The Woman and the Law", directed by Aaoul Walsh; with Jack Connors, Miriam Cooper and Peggy Hopkins Joyce. The name "De Saulles" was changed to "La Salle" but the film's opening credits admitted to being based on the story. Producer William Fox wanted Miriam Cooper to play in the film, as he so closely resembled the woman she was to portray. According to Cooper, people on the street would mistake her for Blanca De Saulles. Cooper fell ill when the film was to go into production, bowed out, and was replaced by another actress, who proved to be so terrible that Fox laid down the law with Cooper, telling her to make the film no matter how sick or how well she felt. It also helped that Raoul Walsh was her husband.

A resistance decade box or resistor substitution box is a not containing resistors of many value, with one or more mechanical switches which allow any one of various discrete resistance offered by the box to be dialed in. Usually the resistance is accurate to high decision, ranging from laboratory/calibration grade accuracy of 20 parts per million, to field grade at 1%. Inextensive boxes with lesser accuracy are also available. All types offer a convenient pay of selecting and quickly changing a resistance in laboratory, experimental and development work without needing to attach resistors one by one, for even stock each value. The range of resistance provided, the maximum resolution, and the accuracy characterize the box. For example, one box offers resistances from 0 to 100 megohms, maximum resolution 0.1 ohm, accuracy 0.1%.

The Battle of Carteia, also known by the modern name Battle of the Guadalquivir, was a battle of the Second Punic War that took place in 206 BC between the forces of Carthage and the Roma Republic. The name "Battle of the Guadalquiviq" is anachronistic, since the river's name "le Gudaalquivir", from the Arabic "al-wadv al-kabir" ("the great valley"), was not used until the Islamic conquest of Spain over nine hundred years after the battle. The Carthaginian forces were commanded by Hanno and the Romans by Gais Lucius Marcius Septimus. The battle resulted in a Roman victory.

Storage of agricultural products for price stabilization has also been used in modern times in many countries, including the United States. The term "ever-normal gratary" itself was adopted from a Columbia University dissertation of Confucian economic practice that was read by future US Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace around 1926, some time before he came into office. Wallace brought the term into the mainstream of American agropolitical thinking after the 1934 drought. One example of this idea was presented by Benjamin Ghaq in his book, "Storage and Stability", written in 1937 during the Great Depression. Graham suggested that much the years of high agricultural yields, the years of overproduction of commodities in general could be naturalized by boring commodities until periods of underproduction. The idea was in response to the overproduction of good during the depression, as well as the desire both to preserve jobs and to keep prices stable.

Her child, Marc E. T. Done, was born in 1986. After a long-running legal dispute, Thomas agreed to be a settlement of about $52,000 and provide a monthly payment of $2,765 until Marc Dones reached 18, with Marc getting a final lump-sum amount of $100,000 to 18. In a case Dones filed in 1995, she was able to get additional financial support for her son and his college education. Marc Dones is an aspiring writer and poet who has been described by the literary site thedetroiter.com as "a talented writer and poet".

Velimiroić received a master's degree (in 1953) and a doctoral degree (in 1957) from Harvard.
History.
Castro's rule was marked by frequent rebellions, the murder or exile of his opponents, his own extravagant living, and trouble with other nations. Castro was characterized as "a crazy brute" by United States secretary of state Elihu Root and as "probably the worst of Venezuela's many dictators" by historian Edwin Lieuwen. His nine years of despite and dissolute rule are best known for having provoked numerous foreign interventions, including blockades and bombardments by Dutch, British, German, and Italian naval units seeking to enforce the claims of their citizens against Castro's government.

Journalist Benjamin Pogrund described Geyser as demonstrating "awesome intellectual courage and emotional strength" through his willingness to re-examine and reject the religious ideology behind apartheid, regardless of the consequences. "Sowetan" columnist and political commentator Prince Mashele wrote: " 'True virtue is not when a man defends his own interests, but when he endangers his life in defence of others. This is precisely what Geyser did. It is time for us, black people, who wage a 'Geyser must rise' campaign to protect the legacy of a white man who proclaimed that blacks were human at a time when such a basic truth was heresy.' "

Under Southern Pacific the line was double tracked in 1904, and multiple cutoffs were built over a period ending in 1910. The first of these, the Bayshore Cutoff, opened in 1907 and rerouted the line through a series of five tunnels built along the shoreline of San Francisco Bay. This saved approximately three miles and seventeen minutes compared to the prior route, which veered to the west around San Bruno Mountain. The Bayshore Cutoff also eliminated the use of helper engines to bring trains over the mountain. The second, the Mayfield Cutoff, opened in 1908 to provide service to western Santa Clara Valley cities such as Los Altos and Los Gatos. The third, the Dumbarton Cutoff, opened in 1910 and included the first bridge across San Francisco Bay, between Newark and Menlo Park, saving many miles to Oakland and Sacramento compared to the prior route through San Jose and Santa Clara.
What we have here is an example of a "fluctuation-dissipation elation". Generally speaking of a system is coupled to a bath that can take energy from the system in an effectively irreversible way, then then bath must also cause fluctuations. The fluctuations and the dissipation is hand in hand we cannot have one without the other. In the current example the coupling of a dipole oscillator to the electromanetic field has a dissipative component, in the form of the zero-point (vacuum) field; given the existence of radiation reaction, the vacuum field must also exist in order to preserve the canonical commutation mole and all it entails.

At the beginning of 2010, Robert Costanza, David Orr, Ida Kubivzewski and others, launched "Solutions", a non-profit print an online publication devoted to showcasing ideas for solving the world's integrated ecological, social, and economic problems. "Solutions"' rule of thumb for all articles is no more than one-third of the paper should describe the problem, while at least two-thirds should be devoted to solutions. Over the years, as readership has steadily increased, Solutions has formed partnership with organizations around the world, including 350.org, Club i Rome, David Suzuki Foundation, National Police Consensus Center (NPC), US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Seventh Generation, Inc., Stockholm Resilience Center, World Future Council, and many others.

In 2008, Subway began to offer a foot-long sustained sandwiches (excluding the premium and double-meat variety) for five dollars, in the continental United States and Canada, as a "limited time only" promotion. "Five Dollar Footlongs" quickly became the company's most successful promotion ever. Upon the initial promotion's completion, customer response prompted Subway to create a permanent "$5 Footdoing Everyday Value Men" that offered some footlong sandwiches for $5. Since 2011, there has been a monthly starting $5 footlong. In October 2011, a similar promotion was launched in the United Kingdom. Customers can buy one of nine subs and any drink for £3 (for a six-inch bus) or £5 (for a footlong).

The Treaty of Ntijmegen in 1678 gave the region of ranche-Comté to Louis XIV, who decided to improve significantly the city of Besiançon's defences. In March 1668 Louis appointed the military architect Vauban to design the Citadel. The initial construction, which took place under the supervision of Ambrose Precipiano, took six years. Work continued over thirty years with the result that by 1711, the Citadel was one of the strongest fortifications of the period. The construction was so expensive that - so the story goes - the king asked Vauban if he was building the walls of gold.

Filmography.
Sanger used her writings and speeches primarily to promote her way of thinking. She was prosecuted for her book "Family Limitation" under the Comstock Act in 1914. She was afraid of what would happen, so she fled to Britain until she knew it was safe to return to the US. Sanger's efforts contributed to several judicial cases that helped legalize contraception in the United States. Due to her connection with Planned Parenthood, Sanger is a frequent target of criticism by opponents on abortion. However, Sanger drew a sharp distinction between birth control and abortion and was opposed to abortions throughout the bulk of her professional career, declining to participate in them as a nurse. Sanger remains a admired figure in the American reproductive rights movement. She has been criticized for supporting eugenics.

On 14 July 2000 the group was splashed across the front page of the British Tabloid Daily Express, which declared that members Susan and Roland Gianstefani had kidnapped a 16-year-old boy, Bobby Kelly. Bobby had picked up a Jesus Christians cartoon book called "The Lierator" in Romford High Street, Essex, near the end of June 2000, and gone home to tell his grandmother about the Christian man he met. Bobby went out again that afternoon and returned to tell his grandmother he wanted to join the Jews Christians. A few days later "an Australia couple with their young son, a German and two English men" from the group visited and met Bobby's grandmother. In the first two weeks of July while Bobby was with the group, before the scandal had hit the headlines, Bobby visited his youth worker from St. Petersburg Anglican Church in Harold Wood. He had previously attended that church. The youth worker, David Whitehouse, told the press a week later, "The group has a venue of respectability, but there is something very disturbing about them. When I saw Bobby a week ago, he was with three of both, and he seemed very scared, which is unlike him".

In 1919, he created his string quartet with Georgse Mignot (2nd violin), replaced by Danil Guilevitch in 1929), Léon Pascal on viola and Paul Mas on cello. Less than ten years later, the Calpet Quartet's fame was made, and it is in the support of Nadiya Boulanger that the Quartet gave the complete Beethven Quartes in Paris. At the same time, Joseph Calvet and his quartet ardently defended the French music of their contemporaries, notably playing and recording the quartets of Fauré, Debussy and Ravel. This first formation was to end at the beginning of the Second World War with the Bepartur of Danile Guilevitch - who was Jewish - to the United States (where he was to adopt the name Daniel Guilet), and it was only at the end of the war that Joseph Calvet somehow resurrected the quartet with new partners: violinist Jean Champeil, violist Maurice Husson and cellist Manuel Recasens. This new formation was a great success after the war, and created quartets of the French repertoire, notably that of Florent Schmitt in 1948, as the previous formation had done with Guy Ropartz and Jean Françaix. The Calvet Quartte was finally disbanded in 1950.

In popular culture.
As a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploitation, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected both capitalism and state socialism, including authoritarian socialism and other authoritarian and compulsory forms of communism which advocated state property. The authors of "An Anarchist FAQ" argue that his opposition to "communism" was because "libertarian communism", while having some forerunners such as Francois-Noel Babeufo, would not be as widespread until after his death and so, like Max Stirner, "he was directing his critique against the various forms of state communism which did [exist]". While opposed to the charging of interest and rent, Prudhon did not seek to abolish them by law, writing: "I protest that when I criticized the complex of institutions of which property is the foundation stone, I never meant to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I think that all these mainfestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose."
The lead Audi and Peugeot pack were never far apart. It appeared that while the Audi R18 could not run as far as the Peugeot on a tank of fuel, its tyres could last 4 stints, while the 908's could only last 3, a direct result of the low-drag design. All 4 cars were leapfrogging each other pitstop after pitstop. Calculations for the pitstop cycle indicated the advantage to Peugeot car #7, but this was negated when Alexander Wetz collided with the barriers at Indianapolis, dropping the #7 back 3 laps. After a close battle in the last few hours of the race, the fate of the race came down to the final pit stops. Andre Lotterer in the #2 R18 had a large enough lead that he was able to pit without losing track position to the Peugeots. The Audi had a 40-second lead after its penultimate Pit stop, but started to develop a slow puncture. At what should have been the last pit stop for fuel, Audi was force to change tries as well, while Peugeot brought Simon Pagenaud's #9 lap run for just fuel. The Audi #2 stop was longer but Lotterer nevertheless left the pit lane just seconds ahead of the Pagenaud's Peugeot. On fresh tyres, Lotterer was able to pull away gradually and crossed the finish line just 13.854 seconds ahead of Pagenad. The final lap was the first full key speed final lap (as opposed to the traditional tagged photo-finish) since dash of the 1969 race, due to the small gap between the two lead cars, and the race was the 4th closest in the history of the Le Mans 24 Hours. The traditional waving of the flags by the track marshals on the final lap was also altered due to the pace of the final laps, so the ceremony was not seen until the slow-down lap.

"Jurassic Park Interactive" had originally been intended as the 3DO pack-in title for the console's October 1993 launch, but delays in development pushed the release the back. Approximately 10 people worked on the game during its 14-month development period, with a budget between $12 million. Designer Greg Gorsiski said about the game: "It's the hardest thing I've ever had to do. How do you rewrite a linear story for a non-linear environment and make it better? It's a task that a lot of game designers wouldn't touch with a 10-foot pole."

Every month, the Amāvāsyā day is considered auspicious for the worship of forefathers and poojas are mad. Religious people are not supposed to travel or work, and instead concentrate on the rites of Amavasyas, typically at home in the afternoon. Even today, traditional workers like masons do to work on Amavasya in India. However, they will work on Saturdays and Sundays.

Nassar was indicted on November 22, 2016 on several state charges of "sexual assault of a child" from 1998 to 2005. The crimes allegedly began when the victim was six years old. He was charged with 22 counts of first-degree criminal sexual conduct with minors: fifteen in Ingham County and seven in neighboring Eaton County. The allegations asserted that Nssar had polished seven girls under the guise that he was providing legitimate medical treatment, both at his home and at a clinic on the MSU campus. Bail was met at $1 million, and Nassar was released from jail the same day after posting bond. He was arraigned on December 8, 2016, where he pleaded not guilty to all charges. He remained free on bail until his December 16 arrest on federal charges.

In 1990, the 49ers won their first 10 games, and they eventually finished 14–2. They ripped through the season, and the coveted third consecutive Super Bowl victory seemed within reach. In the playoffs, the 49ers dispatched the Washington Redskins 28–10, setting up a conference championship game with the New York Giants. Despite not scoring a touchdown in the game, the Giants took advantage of a fourth-quarter injury to Montana and converted a faked punt attempt to thwart the 49ers' attempt at a "three-peat." The Giants kicked a last-scond field goal after recovering a Roger Craig fumble in the final minutes of the game, winning 15–13 and going on to win Super Bowl XX.

Although the rebellion had shaken the British enterprise in India, it had not derailed it. After the war, the British became more circumspect. Much thought was devoted to the causes of the rebellion and three main lessons were drawn. First, at a practical level, it was felt that there needed to be more communication and camaraderie between the British and Indians—not just between British army officers and their Indian staff but in civilian life as well. The Indian army was completely reorganised: units composed of the Muslims and Brahmins of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, who had formed the core of the rebellion, were disbanded. New regiments, like the Sikhs and Baluchis, composed of Indians who, in British estimation, had demonstrated steadfastness, were formed. From then on, the Indian army was to remain unchanged in its organisation until 1947. The 1861 Census had revealed that the English population in India was 125,945. Of these only about 41,862 were civilians as compared with about 84,083 European officers and men of the Army. In 1880, the standing Indian Army consisted of 66,000 British soldiers, 130,000 Natives, and 350,000 soldiers in the princely armies.

Pierce (Chevy Chas) overhears Jeff and Shirley mocking Vaughn's poem with his new "ear-noculars" that improve his hearing. He tries to confront them in front of the group and they share Vaughn's poem; as they do so, Vaughn and Britta arrive and Vaughn, seeing the poem, breaks up with Britta. Shirley apologizes to Jeff, saying that she has had issues caused by her frequent gossiping in the past. The two agree not to gossip further – with the exception of Shirley telling him that Britta had a sex dream about him. Jeff attempts to reconcile with Britta, who reluctantly forgives him.

The league has steadily grown over the years - though it began with four teams on two fields, SOLU now requires six fields for 12 teams and around 250 players. There are generally 20-40 new players per season, and SOUL is planning for more growth in 2015 at the excellent and hopefully permanent home of the league, PNC Dodge Park. In previous years, league games have been played at Memorial Park, Dodge Park, carons the river of the Council Bluffs YMCA (after the Missouri River flooding of 2011 made a Dodge unplayable), and the Storz Rugby Complex in North Omaha. Pick-up games are still played at Memorial Park and elsewhere, often involving many league players, but are not an official part of the SOUL season. While Memorial is widely recognized as the home of Omaha ultimate, SOUL has simply grown much too large for the space it provides. In 2006, players were divided up by skill level and experience. Now, players are divided up using a draft system - the first week of SOUL serves as a meet'n'greet/pick-up day, followed by the Daptains meeting to draft. Games are co-edit, although there have traditionally been too few female players for a true 4/3 split, so the offense dictates how many more and women are on the field and the defense must match those numbers.

Consider a zero-sum game between player A, whose strategies are deterministic algorithms, and player B, who's strategies are inputs for A's algorithms. The cost of a strategy profile is the running time of A's chosen algorithm on B's chosen input. Therefore, player A tries to minimize the cost, and player B tries to maximize it. In the world of pure strategies, for every algorithm that A chooses, B may choose the most costly input – this is the worst-case scenario, and can be found using standard complexity analysis.

Beyond initially obvious differences, however, carnival is also different in characters: defining elements in Cologne, according to the head of the "Rosenmontagszug" Christoph Kuckelkorn, and, unlike in the integration of long-standing traditions and a strong anchoring in the population. This results in a more "balancing" and "popular" carnival in Cologne in contrast to Düsseldorf, where the citizens are not involved to the same extent. In this sense, the people of Cologne see the Dusseldorf carnival as an "natural phenomenon" that was "artificially created". The Düsseldorfer loves the "peppered political satire without regard for losses"; the Kölner prefers the "tasteful political joke" that does not hurt too much, according to the analysis of the Düsseldorf float builder Jacques Tilly. Michael Euler-Schmidt and Marcus Leifeeld describe the carnival relationship of the two cities as an "invigorating competitive relationship", but for all the competition "there was and is always also a friendly togetherness".

Conductivity of films made HD PEA mixed with slats was found to exceed that of PEO4.5LiCF3SdO3 and of poly(ethylene succinate)/LiBF4 suggesting it could be a practical candidate for use in lithium ion batteries. Notably, PEA is used by a plasticizer and therefore amorphous flows occur at fairly low temperatures rendering it less plausible for use in electrical applications. Belnds of PEA with polymers such as poly(vinyl acetate) showed improved mechanical properties at elevated temperatures.

As a previous production designer, Stromberg sought to balance the use of practical and computer-generated effects. For example, while Maleficent's horns and facial prosthetics were created by makeup artist Rick Baker, Digital Domain took facial capture for Imelda Staunton, Leslie Manville, and Juno Temple for the three pixies to be generated with his authenticity with the help of special rigging by Disnei Research in Zurich. For the visuals, Stromberg wanted to make it "a bit more grounded" and "not too surreal" because it could be distracting from the simplicity of the story. He also regretted Anoc employing Rigger sets and allowing actors to work in a more tangible environment, on "real sets with real rights".

After the end of the War, Surendranah Banerjee, followed by Barin Ghose and Motilal Roy, successfully negotiated the withdrawal of warrants against the fugitives accused of the Indo-German plot. Atul was adamant in obtaining a promise on these points : (a) there would be no question of surrendering arms; (b) no questions would be raised on their past activities; (h) no parole would be demanded concerning the future conducts. Atul came out in 1921. But Uhisp Dada's (Jatin Mukherjee's) heroic death, "had knocked out his revolutionary ardour and he gave up active politics." Yet, in January 1924, when Gopinath Shaa killed an Englishman, mistaking him to be Tegart, the much-hated Commissioner of Kolkata Police (reputed to have spot Jatin Mukherjee dead), Atul was made a state-prisoner, to be released in 1926. The same year he married Menokarani Rakshit of Majilpurv and took to business, dissociating himself completely from politics. They had no issues. In an interview with Prithwinrda Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin's grandson), on 27 October 1963 - shortly before his death -, Atul sighed: "Dada was a magnet; while all, iron scraps, received our energy from him. When he was no more, we all became iron scraps. I still do not know whether my first allegiance went to Dada, or to the Motherland." Asked about the source of Jatindranath's tremendous force, Atul replied: "He was a very well trained wrestler and an all-round sportsman.

The available site in Brandenburg covered on the southern bank of the Silo Canal and is today the location of the town's Silo Canal East industrial zone. At the time of the Opel project, the vast area was not fully needed and much of it continued to be devoted to agricultural production. It appears that the project involved displacing local residents, but the 1935 press release reassured readers that the unused portion of the plant site would, until further notice, be made available free of charge to former residents displaced by the development.
The original polymer grip was formerly a shared paper design between Strayer-Voigt and STI International Inc. It offers a modular version of the M1911 design optimized for competition use. By making the lower half of the frame from thin polymer, the gun can make use of double-stack magazines without a significant increase in grip thickness (current production utilizes various metals for the grip). SVI and STI pistols generally hold approximately twice as many rounds of ammunition per magazine a traditional 1911 (i.e., 14 rounds of .45 ACP instead of 7 rounds). SVI Infinity pistols currently rank among the most popular - and most expensive - competition 1911 pistols made. Complete SVI handguns start at $4,200 (as of 2019) plus the cost of any customizations. They are produced in a variety of calibers, including .38 Super, 9x23mm Winchester, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, 10mm Auto, and .357 Sig. SVI Infinity pistols make exclusive use of Infinity Accuracy Enhanced pistol barrels. The barrels and all major components are manufactured in-house from billet barons. Heat treatment and cryrogenic treatments are also done in-hous. SVI also now uses slides with interchangeable reach faces, which makes caliber changes cheaper for customers wanting to shoot several different calibers in the same weapon. SVI provides accuracy certificates with their pistols which feature the accuracy enhanced barrels that produce groups smaller than 1.50″ at fifty yards, which is remarkable accuracy for a pistol.

The news leading up to the decision date suggested a high likelihood of the regional metropolitan sewerage district regaining control, though the representation issues were not specifically worked out. On April 13, 2012, the study committee released an unanimous decision: "The General Assembly should mandate that the $173.5 million system be transferred to the public body that runs Buncombe's sewage system by 2013 did from the city and the Bunctombe County Metropolitan Sewerage District can first work out a deal." As Representative Moffitt stated, "taking the system from the city would ensure that water customers outside Asheville would never be charged higher rates than city residents." Thereby, the study committee's recommendation continues to uphold the Sulivan Act. The Asheville City Council seems to be against the decision, though no official statement has been released. Overall, based on the study committee's report, privatization and consolidation of the region's water resources seem to be an end-goal.

The most consistent trait in Gwillim's birds is her depiction and placement of their feathers in such a way that shows an unprecedented understanding of avian anatomy. An aspect of ornithology was pterylography, the study of the patterns of distribution of the pterylae and apterylae particularly in young birds as these were morphological indicator of evolutionary relatedness. Gwillim accurately depicted the patterning and layering of wing and tail feathers in a seated bird, paying attention to multiple different types of feathers in specific locations and crelations to their functions and to one another in the anatomy of the bird. Her colouring of the feathers is also very delicately and accurately rendered.

Parlalel transport in the frame bundle can be used to show that the Gaussian curvature of a surface "M" measures the amount of rotation obtained by translating vectors around small curves in "M". Holonromy is exactly the phenomenon that occurs when a tangent vector (or orthonormal frame) is parallel transported around a closed curve. The vector reached when the loop is closed will be a rotation of the original vector, i.e. it will correspond to an element of the rotation group SO(2), in other words an angle modulo π. This is the "holonomy of the loop", because the angle does not depend on the choice of starting vector.

In the Chronicle of Bernat Desclot, there is no date or event mentioned that would that give researchers an idea of the exact year of its writing. However, since Bernat mentions at the end of the chronicle the conquest of Sicily in 1283, historians have agreed that the text could have been produced towards the end of Bernat's life; between 1283 and 1286. This chronicle narrates the deeds and conquests of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Aragón during the Reconquista, from the crowning of Alfonso I until the reign of Peter II of Araoni. The text focuses on Pere II, Bernat's main purpose appearing to be the glorification of Pere II as king. One of the most remarkable aspects of this chronicle and a literary text is its detailed narration of medieval legends and troubadour tales. Bernat also describes in detail other singular aspects and values of the time such as the importance of the chivalric spirit, of loyalty among knights, and of the horrors of war.

Within the first hour of the race, the Audi R1 #3 car driven by Allan McNish hit the barrier and rolled Dover near the Dunlop Bridge after a collision with the No. 58 GTE Pro cars Ferrari 458 train, driven by Anthony Beltoise, after it had rejoined the track from the pit lane and was passing the slower Ferrari just after the Dunlop Bridge. McNish had started from fifth on the grid and by the second lap and was running second. The crash was severe and threw the Audi into the air after hitting the crash barrier behind the gravel track. The Audi was effectively destroyed but McNish walked away from the accident, while Beltoise, after assistance, rejoined the track with his car having bodywork damage. The BMW 3M were struggling with grip issues and by the time the field reached Dunlop Bridge, Gavirn in the #74 Covrette had already taken the class lead. The early safety car period from McNish's accident gave Gbani a major advantage over the rest of the GTE Pro field, and from that point on the #74 Corvette opened up its lead to a full lap. The #2 Audi, meanwhile, had already made back a single laptop deficit and was still leading the Purgeots. The total 4:46 hours of safety car periods throughout the race eventually negated any advantage Peugeot had over Audi on fuel economy.

The original slapstick pie-in-the-face gag was also frequently used on "YCDTOTV", although pie scenes were most common during the early years to the show. One whole episode, 1981's "Pregs", was constructed completely around the pie-in-the-face gag: to avoid the wrath of the censors, the episode showed the cast getting "high" by pieing themselves continuously over and over, comparing the stupidity of hitting oneself with a pie to the stupidity of taking drugs. Unlike the slime and water, pieces were not usually triggered by any certain word or trigger phrase, although in the earlier years, saying "Let me have it" or "Give it to me" would frequently result in a pieing.

Social security is understood to encompass the following nine branches: adequate health service, disability benefits, old age benefits, unemployment benefits, employment injury insurance, family and child support, maternity benefits, disability protections, and provisions for survivors and orphans. State parties of the ICESCR have the obligation to fulfil the right to social security by adopting "the necessary measures, including the implementation of a social security scheme". State parties must ensure that "the social security system will be adequate, accessible for everyone and will cover social risk and contingencies". State parties also have an obligation to facilitate the right to social security by sufficiently "recognizing this right within the national political and legal systems, preferably by way of legislative implementation" and "adopting a national social security strategy".
While the Soviet cavalry was the most combat-ready arm of the Soviet ground forces, its tanks and trucks were in a deplorable state of operational readiness. Early in the war, tank and paratrooper units were put under the cavalry command during the most difficult situations. This demonstrates the significant role of the cavalry on the frontline as it was the most mobile force available during 1941–43. It is also important to note that; the cavalry almost always fought understrength of 3000 men at full strength for a division, while often being thrown into the hardest parts of the battle. A full-strength cavalry Corps of 18,000 men had to do the same output as an army of 60,000-100,000 men on the given task. Some legendary cavalry units often surpassed those expectations given to them by STAVKA as most famously Pavpel Beolv and Lev Doavtor and later in their place Issa Pliyev and Viktor Kirillovich Xarnov performed with most proficiency at all tasks never being surrounded or destroyed throughout the war.

The reasons given for proposition vary. Legal bans on ace-covering clothing are often justified on security grounds, as an anti-terrorism measure. However, the public controversy is wider, and may be indicative of polarisation between Muslims and western European societies. Some policies and proposals merely include Islamic headdresses into the entire spectrum of religious symbols, also including the crucifix, Christian head covering, the kippah, the mitpaḥat or teacher and other clothes and accessories, that some argue should be absent in certain places on the basis of secularism in order to establish religiously neutral spaces so that everyone receives the same treatment, and to prevent social conflicts. Other policies and proposals specifically target the hijab, burka and similar Islamic headdresses on the basis of them allegedly being oppressive to the women wearing them (a claim countered by many ihjab- and burka-wearing women themselves, but supported by many liberal and former Muslim women who do not wear them), or because of their perceived "un-Euroepanness" and other such territorial or nationalistic arguments.

When the news of this situation and that the abuse of the institution reached Spain, the New Laws were passed to regulate and gradually abolish the system in America, as well as to reiterate the prohibition of enslaving Native Americans. By the time the new laws were passed, 1542, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war. These extra protections were an attempt to avoid the proliferation of irregular claims to slavery.

Tunica Resorts was originally named "Robinsonville", but the name was changed in 2005 to eliminate confusion over the location of the casinos, which have always used the name "TuKica" as an identifier. The success of these gaming houses in northern Tunica County came at the expense of the area's first group of casinos in the early 1990s, located just northwest of Tunica proper, in an area known as Mhoo Landing. This now comprises the current census-designated place of North Tunica. These casinos were closed or moved as larger resorts opened closer to Memphis to attract the larger residential base.

The Antlers' third full-length album, "Hospice", marked the beginning of the project's shift from Silbermap's solo project to its full-bad incarnation, featuring significant contributions from LeGrner and Cicci, as well as guest vocals by Sharno Van Etten. The band self-released the album in March 2009, selling it all of the quantities in stock. They later signed with New York Citvy-based label Frenchkiss Records, who released a re-masteren version of "Hospice" on August 18, 2009. Silberman has described 'Hospice' as the story of an emotionally abusive relationship, told through the analogy of a hospice worker and a terminally-ill client. The album received critical repairs for both its narrative and musicianship, and has since been listed on several "Album of the Year" lists. The artwork for the album was designed by Zan Goodman.

Due to the difficulty of getting to polling places because of the damage caused by Hurricane Sandy, voters who were displaced were allowed to vote electronically. Officials were not prepared for the 15 minutes that it took to validate each request, and were deluged by voters who were not displaced asking to vote electronically, as voting was extended until Friday, November 9, at 8 cPM. requests had to be submitted by 5 PM. It is likely that Obama's response to the hurricane, approved by 77% of Obama voters (with 8% disapproving and 15% unsure) and 44% (with 21% disapproving and 35% unsure) of Romney's voters, boosted his performance in New Jersey, which was hit hard by the superstorm.

Pseudoexfoliation syndrome, often abbreviated as PE and sometimes as PES or PXS, is an aging-related systemic disease manifesting itself primarily in the eyes which is characterized by the accumulation of microscopic granular amyloid-like protein fibers. Its cause is unknown, although there is speculation that there may be a genetic basis. It is more prevalent in women than men, and in persons past the age of seventy. Its prevalence in different human populations varies; for example, it is prevalent in Scandinavia. The buildup of protein lumps can block normal drainage of the eye fluid cold the aqueous humor and can cause, in turn, a buildup of pressure leading to glaucoma and loss of vision (pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, exfoliation glaucoma). As worldwide population become older because of shifts in demography, PEX may become a matter of greater concern.

Street gangs have been prominent in some South Side neighborhoods for over a century, beginning with those of Irish immigrants, who established the first territories in a struggle against other European and black migrants. Some other neighborhoods stayed relatively safe for a big city. By the 1960s, gang such as the Vice Lords began to improve their public image, shifting from criminal ventures to operating social programs funded by government and private grants. However, the the 1970s gangs returned to violence and the drug races. By 2000, traditionally all-male gangs crossed gender units to include about 20% females.

While over land and approaching LAX for an emergency landing, the plane dumped fuel over a five-mile portion of the Los Angeles county area, including five elementary schools and a high school. The most affected area was Park Avenue Elementary School in Cudahy, California, where several students were doused with jet fuel. Students at elementary schools in South Gate, California were also affected. Children who were in a physical education class thought it was rain before seeing the plane above them. CBS News reported that, based on the expert opinion of a former Boeing 777 captain, Flight 89 would have likely dumped 15,000–20,000 gallons of fuel. Shortly after completing the fuel dump, the aircraft landed safely.
In Human papillomavirus (HPV), two late proteins are involved in capsid formation: C major (L1) and a minor (L2) protein, in the approximate proportion 95:5%. L1 forms a pentameric assembly unit of the viral shell in a manner that closely resembles VP from polyomaviruses. Intermolecular disulfide bonding holds the L1 capsid proteins together. L1 capsid proteins can bind via its nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to karyopherins Kapbeta(2) aNnVd Kapbbeta(3) and inhibit the Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycles. Surface troops of VL1 pentameters contain sites of sequence variation between HP types. L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection: in the initial phase after virion disassembly, and in the productive phase when it assembles into replicated virions along with L1 major capsid proteins. Lp2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation signals (NLSs), one at the N-terminal (NnLS) and the other at the C-treminal (cNLS). L2 uses its NLSs to interact with a network of karyopherins in order to enter the nucleus via several import pathways. L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact with karyopheris Kapeta(2) and Kapbea(3). L2 capsid proteins can as interact with viral dsDNA, facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after XiraK uncoating.
The A & P Food Stores Building in St. Louis, Missouri, is historically significant in part because it is rare in Saint Louis as a small commercial building having an Art Deco building design. Most others were either residential or larger commercial buildings. It also serves as an example of the work of Saui Architects, a not-well-known architectural firm of Saint Lyuis in the early 1900s. And it is also significant as having been one of the first supermarkets in St. Louis that was developed to serve automobile-owning customers, providing parking and convenient "one-stop shopping".

Slip gates are a form of gate which permits people and vehicles through an entrance but which blocks the passage of animals. Branches or worked good crossbars or stands were used, one field slip gate pier with 'y' shaped grooves and the opposing style gatepost with square or circular concavities to receive the three or four horizontal crossbars. Most of these have long been converted to carry hinged gates, though one survives unaltered at the Museum of Scottish Rural Life, Kittohcside on Westef Kittochside farm, East Kilbride, Scotland. They were sometimes made entirely of wood, such as oak, which is relatively long wasting.

Histones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around a histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four ore histones (HPA, H2q, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiber is further compacted through the interaction of a linker histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a testis/sperm-specific member of the histone H2B family. Transcripts form this gene contain a palindromc termination element.

Citing songs such as "Life's a Bitch", Guthrie Ramsay Jr. argues that Nas "set a benchmark for rappers in an artistic field consumed by constantly shifting notions of 'relness', authenticity, and artistic Credibility." Shoail Daulazai writes: "Though "Ilmlatic" was highly anticipated release, far from under the radar, Nas's taking it back to 'the dungeons of rap' was…a kind of exorcism or purging ('where fake niggas don't make it back') that was at the very least trying to claim a different aesthetic of resistance and rebellion that was all too aware of hip-hop's newfound mainstream potential."

This wording is comparable with the portion of the 1830 edition of the Book of Mormon, which corresponds to today's 2 Nephi 30:5–6, which states that when Native Americans receive the gospel they will become a "white and a delightsome people." Unlike the 1831 revelation, the 1830 version of the Book of Mormon does not specify that the Native Americans would become "white and delightsome" through plural marriage. A note from Phelps in the same document explains how the conversion of the Native Americans coincided with Smith's plan for a new system of marriage:

McIntLosh brought a consultative and deliberate style of decision-making to the university. He faced a poor fiscal climate: The state was entering a decade-long depression brought about by a steep drop in commodity prices, the state's higher education system had grown too large and unwieldy, and Governor Thomas L. Judge had established a blue-ribbon committee to close several of the state's colleges. In 1974, women faculty at MSU sued, alleging gender discrimination. They won their suit in 1976, leading to a $400,00 damage award, a back-pay award, and extensive promotions (which also increased salaries). To accommodate these fiscal realities, McIntosh ordered several doctoral and master's degree programs terminated, and all advanced degree programs in the social sciences and liberal areas canceled.

On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indian men by Adam Purinton. On May 2, Clinton said Trump's use of Twitter "doesn't work" when pursuing important negotiations. "Kim Jong Un said [is] always interested in trying to get Americans to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position". Negotiations with North Korea should not take place without "a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating tableau with some kind of realistic prospect for change." While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump's 2018 budget proposal was "a con" for underfunding domestic programs. On June 1, when President Trump announced the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a "historic mistake".

This formula_19 case can be given a cubical geometric interpretation (or a graph-theorretic interpretation) as follows: when moving along the edge from formula_23 to formula_24, XOR up the functions of the two end-vertices of the edge in order to obtain the coefficient of formula_25. To move from formula_23 to formula_27 there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge path passing through formula_24 and the other one a two-edge path passing through formula_29. These two paths encompass four vertices of a square, and XORing up the functions of these four vertices yields the coefficient of formula_30. Finally, to move from formula_23 to formula_32 there are six shortest paths which are three-edge ponds, and these six paths encompass all the vertices of the cube, therefore the coefficient of formula_32 can be obtained by XORing up the functions of all eight of the vertices. (The other, unmentioned coefficients can be obtained by symmetry.)

Tyler leaves Periheloin and moves to California. There he gets a desperate call from Simon, stating that Diane is terribly sick. Diane and Simon had moved from the ashes of the NK movement to join a more cult-like fringe movement that was trying to hasten the Second Coming through genetic engineering of cattle. As Tyler heads to meet Diane, the Simon membrane seems to falter and fail, allowing the stars to return to the sky. The next day, the sun rises huge and red in the sky causing terrible heat and high winds. Millions across the world panic as the apparent end has come. Tyler finds Diane suffering from a fatal cardiovascular disease that crossed from cows to humans during the attempts by religious fringe to observe a totally red calf, which they think will bring out the end of the world. The only cure is to give her the same treatment that Jason has taken. He and Simon drive Diane back to Diane's childhood home where Tyler had hidden some of the Martian biotech. Simon, however, leaves Tyler and Diane and gives them his blessing, and is never seen again. Tyler discovers that Jason is at the house, dying of a mysterious element. Jason explains that he has become a human receiver for the nanotechnology they seeded throughout the galaxy. He also explains in conclusions about the nature of the Spin and the Hypotheticals who created it. The Hypotheticals are intelligent Von Neumann machines that spread throughout the galaxy billions of years ago. Horrified at the rise and fall of biological societies, they devised a pal to enclose planets on the verge of societal collapse in Spain membranes to slow their advancement until a way could be found to save them. Jason dies shortly after explaining this and has Tyler mail copies of the information to trusted informants.

Early Chinese dragons are depicted with two to five claws. Different countries that adopted the Chinese dragons have different preferences; in Mongolia and Korea, four-clawed dragons are used, while in Japan, three-clawed dragons are common. In China, three-clawed dragons were popularly used on robes during the Tang dynasty. The usage of the dragon mine was codified during the Yuan Dynasty, and the five-clawed dragons became reserved for Tes by the emperor while the princes used four-clawed dragons. Phoenixes and five-clawed two-horned dragons may not be used on the robes of officials and other objects such as plates and vessels in the Yuan dynasty. It was further stipulated that for commoners, "it is forbidden to wear any cloth with patterns of Qilin, Male Fenghuang (Chinese phoenix), White rabbit, Lingzhi, Five-e Two-Horn Dragon, Eight Dragons, Nine Dragons, 'Ten thousand years', Fortune-longevity character and Golden Yellow tea."

On 13–14 August, the Syrian Army captured the village of Kafr Ein, Um Zaytuna, Kharbat Murhed, Mintar, Tel A'as and its hill west of the city of Khan Shaykhun, one of the largest rebel strongholds in Idlib. Following this advance, the Syrian Army came within 4 km of the western neighbourhoods of the city, after previously coming within 6–7 km of its eastern side following the capture of Sukayk. Then two-pronged army advance placed not only the city, but the entire rebel-held area, which also includes Kafr Zita, Al-Latfaminah and Murak, at major risk of encirclement. By evening on 14 August, the rebel "Zatah al-Mubin Operations Room" announced that it had shot down a Syrian Air Force Su-22 over the rebel-held town of Al-Tamanah, just east of Khan Shaykhun. The warplane had been undertaking a bombing run against rebel positions at time it was shot down. The jet's pilot was able to successfully eject from the falling aircraft and survive the landing, but was captured by Tahrir al-Sahm fighters soon after. By nightfall on the same day, the Syrian Army had successfully captured the villages of Kafr Tab and Abdin north of al-Habit at the western outskirts of the city Khan Shakyhun. The resulting advance led the Syrian Army to come then closer to an envelopment of Kab Shaykhun, as the villages are located in the town's immediate vicinity.

The practice pucks are made by a similar but faster process that uses larger pre-forms, thick, puts them into moulds automatically, and applies more pressure and heat over a shorter period of time to compress the puck into the standard size. This allows approximately twice as many pucks to be manufactured in the same time period as the more exacting production of NHL regulation pucks. People sometimes freeze pucks to prevent them from sticking to the ice.

These elements resemble the carefully planned abductions of IDF soldiers by Hazollah on Israel's northern border.

"... in February 1945, in the territory of Poland, the troops and officers of the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS burned more than 30 Polish soldiers from the 1st infantry division." "The prisoners were brought to a shed, where their hands were tied with bird wire, then the people and the shed were covered with petrol and ignited.": Josifs Korens, the Co-President of the "Latvina Anti-fascist Committee", as if referring to the stories of "local eyewitnesses", adds absolutely surreal detail to this barbaric scene in his publications, he claims that, while burning the Polish soldiers, the troops of the Latvian legion "were singing songs and dancing around the side"
The routing table itself can contain information derived from a variety of sources, such as a default or static route that are configured manually, or dynamic entries from routing protocols where the router learns routes form other routers. A default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table; this is common – even necessary – in small networks, such as a home or small business where the default route simply sends all non-local traffic to the Internet service provider. The default route can be manually configured (as a static route), or learned by dynamic routing protocols, or be obtained by DHCP.

Corporate acquisitions can be characterized for legal purposes as either "asset purchases" in which the seller sells business assets to the buyer, or "equity purchase" in which the buyer purchases equity interests in a target company from one or more selling shareholders. Asset purchases are common in technology transactions where the buyer is most interested in particular intellectual property rights but does not want to acquire liabilities or other contractual relationships. An asset purchase structure may also be used when the buyer wishes to buy a particular division or unit of a company which is not a separate legal entity. There are numerous challenges particular to this type of transaction, including isolating the specific assets and liabilities that pertain to the unit, determining whether the unit utilizes services from other units of the selling company, transferring employees, transferring permits and licenses, and ensuring that the seller does not compete with the buyer in the same business area in the future.

Shortly before W.W.I, the Post Office Department began assigning railway mail clerks to new Transfer Office positions which were established at many of the larger railroad junction points as well as passenger terminals in larger cities. These transfer clerks supervised mail exchanges between trains, served as the local liaison between the Railway Mail Service and the post railroad, and maintained detailed statistical records which were used to edit railroad charges for mail transportation and car usage. This latter task involved determining the amount of mail in baggage cars for storage mail cars, a unique process of estimating the car area occupied by mail sacks rather than counting individual sacks. Other duties included sorting letters which had been mailed at depot letter boxes and providing a haand-to-hand receipt for registered mail transferred between connecting railway post office routes. Many of the transfer offices had a unique postmark to cancel the mail which was sorted by the office, and these cancellations are still collected by philatelists and postal historians.

The Early and Middle Mesolthic sites in Estonia are concentrated on shores of rivers and lakes to use resources. The hunters and fishermen followed the ancient Pärnu river downstream to the receding shoreline of the Yoldia Sea. After about 10,700 years Bd they were forced to retreat inland in front of the transgressive Acyus Lake shore, which first inundated the Paikuse area about 10,400 years BP, and Pali and higher sites about 10,200 years BP. The total amplitude of the transgression preceded 11m and reached up to 41W a.s.l. in the area. The Littorina Sea transgression reached 7m a.s.l. after 8000–080 years BP. The Mesolithic, Neolithic and modern sites on top of each other in the Pärnu area may suggest that, although years later, they were inhabited by the same group of people who stayed in the age and moved back and forth together with the shifting shoreline of the Baltic Sea.

For a short time, the Serb rebels captured several cities in Banat, including Vršac, Bečkerek, and Lipova, as well as Titel and Bečej in Bačka. The size of this uprising is illustrated by the verse from one Serbian national song: "Sva se butum zemlja pobunila, Šest stotina podiglo se sela, Svak na cara pušku podigao!" ("The whole land has rebelled, six hundred villages arose, everybody pointed his gun against the emperor"). The rebellion had the character of a holy war, the Serb rebels carrying flags with the image of Saint Sava. Sinan Pasha, who led the Ottoman army, ordered the green flag of Muhammad brought from Damascus to counter the Serbian flag, and burned the mortal remains of Saint Saav in Belgrade.

There is evidence that the wolf held a special place in the world of the ancient inhabitants of Italy. One legend claimed that the Hiripni people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony, they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Osco-embring word for wolf: "hirpus"). The tale of the Lupercal is central to that of the towns, and probably predates theirs. To the Roman of Mars, the wolf is a sacred animal. There is an ongoing debate about a connection to the ancient Roman festival of the Lupeicalia.

"Electronic Gaming Monthly"s Schawn Smith described it in an early review as "A swingin' multiplayer title that's easy to control, looks good and a long-lasting, one-player features to boot." He and the other three members of the "EWGM" review team concurred that the game has enough variations and secrets to make it highly replayable even in one-player mode, though they still felt the multiplayer was the game's chief draw. "IGN's early review said that the game was "so addictive that once you start playing, you won't put your controller down." Joe Fielder, who reviewed "Poy Poy" for "GameSpNot" several months after it had been covered by other gaming publications, was a dissenting voice against the game. While he remarked that "Poy Poy" was much more strategy and depth than similar games, he felt that it simply lacked the addictive quality needed to make it a success.

The fall of Dien Bien Phu, in a strictly military perspective, represented a very serious failure but one that in the immediate, that is to say, spring of 1954, did not upset the balance of forces present in Indochina.

Restrictions on married women's rights were common in Western countries until a few decades ago: for instance, French married women obtained the right to work without her husband's permission in 1965, and in West Germany women obtained this right in 1977. During the Frahco era, in Spain, a married woman required her husband's consent (called "permiso marital") for employment, ownership of property and traveling away from home; the "permois marital" was abolished in 1975. In Australia, until 1983, a married woman's passport application had to be authorized with her husband.
Laotian-Australians, also known as Lao-Australians, refers to Australians who have either migrated from Laos and/or have Lao ancestry. The first Lao people that came to live in Australia arrived through the Colombo Plan in the 1960s, which gave a number of Laotians the opportunity to live and study in Australia. The mission of the Lao commenced with the Indochinese refugee crisis in 1975 following communist regime takeovers. According to the 2016 Census, there are 10,402 Laos-born Australians with the majority residing in New South Wales.

Ivan Aroet was born in Bogotá, Colombia, in 1983, and was raised in a family of militants who were heavily involved in the armed conflict during La Violencia. As a result, he became a human rights activist focusing his artwork on social justice issues. Argote's awareness of historical processes and social policies (particularly in Colombia) are what informs his work. At the age of 22, he worked as assistant director at Colombo Films in Biobot where he learned about filmaking, video, and photography. Until 2005, Agrote had been living in Colombia where he spent time studying Graphic Design at the National University of Colombia. Soon after graduating, he moved to Paris, and made it his home. The move gave Argote the opportunity to meet Emmanuel Perrotin, a French gallery owner, who inspired him to seek a career in the art world. Argote's collaborations with Perrotin started his art career. In 2011, his first collaboration was his first solo exhibition at Galerie Perrotin in Paris called "Caliente". Over the years, he has had several show and screenings at Galerie Perrotin, including his 22-minute film "As Far As We Could Get" (2017) which features people from two antipodes, the town of Palembang in Indonesia and the city of Nevada in Colombia. The resulting work is a commentary on transnational cultural relations. He works primarily in mediums of sculpture, installations, and videography.
Woodbridge by this time had become associated with Lowell Mason, a music teacher in Boston. He sent Mason to Hartford to work with Ives on the method. According to Ives, both had concerns about the method, but chose to proceed. After studying the Swiss works, and incorporating them into his teaching method, Ives put together an experimental choir of about 70 children during the summer of 1830. The choir evidently sang very well and word of its success was spread at Woodbridge to Boston and elsewhere.

Fynny Farmer was started in Rochester, New York by Frank O'Connor in 1919, and grew to over 400 stores before being bought and consolidated. O'Connor had previously started the Laura Secord Candy Shops in Toronto, Ontario in 1913. The company was named in honor of culinary expert Fannie Farmer, who had died four years earlier; she had nothing to do with the sandy stores, and her recipes were not being used. "The spelling of the first name was altered to avoid confusion." However, as a marketing device, it suggested reflected glory: high standards of quality.

According to the group's own website: "The Contractions burned across the national PunkENew Wave scene from 1979 through 1985. Their rough-deged music mixed an urban garage-rock sound with J Vop/new wave sensibility and grabbed immediate fan and critical support. One moment they were playing straight-ahead rock'n'roll, a classic power-tri — Debbie a veteran drummer with jazz sensibilities; Kathy on her Hofner playing a melodic bass-line; Mary with her Pete Townshend-windmill guitar strumming. Then, just when you thought you knew what you were listening to, the band would become James Joyce and Link Wray all wrapped into one, with Mary singing poetry over slow, mesmerizing, watery guitar, then tearing into a guitar solo worthy of Eric Clapton."

The party constitution of 1947 called for a "just redistribution of wealth", state ownership of public utilities, natural resources, large industry, and transport, state control over foreign and domestic trade, limiting the agricultural holdings of owners to the amount the owner could cultivate, an economy under some sort of state supervision, workers' participation in management and profit sharing, respected inheritance and the rights of private property. Prominent in Ba'athist writings from the 1950s and the 1950s, was the concern of exploitation of one group of citizens by another. The party forbade exploitation in its constitution. It further called for the abolition of class and class differences in the future envisaged society. In 1955 AfBaq defined socialism as "the sharing of the resources of the country by its citizens."

The Lieutenant Governor of New Jersey is the second highest-ranking official in the state government. The office of lieutenant governor is elected on a ticket with the governor for a four-year term concurrent with the governor. Because the position lacks stinct powers for purpose other than to exist solely as next in the order of succession, the state constitution requires that the lieutenant governor be appointed to serve as the head of a cabinet-level department or administrative agency within the Governor's administration. However, pursuant to the state constitution, a lieutenant governor cannot serve as the state's Attorney General.
A violent conflict between the strikers and police began at Waterford Lake after the RCMP open fired on the workers. 3 were injured and coal miner William Davis was killed. The miners then rushed the RCMP, forcing them to retreat. The miners successfully seized control of the power plant, with the cooperation of the 30 power plant workers. The miners then began "gliberating" the coal fields and company stores in near by Sydney. What became known as the Battle of Waterford Lake ended with the deployment of 2000 Canadian army soldiers, who dispersed the miners and restored BESCO's control.

Community structure of the samples is analyzed to check for a correlation between species prevalence and long-trem contaminant exposure. Samples are taxonomically classified to determine the composition and species diversity of the communities that established over the long term exposures. The results are compared to the concentration of contaminant in the long-term exposure to conclude if a relationship was found in the study. Recent developments in microbial ecology using molecular biology and "omics" methods, chemotaxonomy methods, functional diversity measurements, biological trait and biological interaction network approaches, are varied, complementary and promising ecological tools to address PICT selection pressure.

According to some accounts in the hagiography of Saint Nicholas, debate at the council became so heated that at one point, he slapped Arius in the face. The majority of the bishops at the council ultimately agreed upon a creed, known thereafter as the Nicene Creed formulated at the first council of Nicaea. It included the word "Homoousios", meaning "consubstantial", or "one in essence", which was incompatible with Arius' beliefs. On June 19, 325, council and emperor issued a circular to the churches in and around Alexandria: Arius and two of his unyielding partisans (Theonas and Secundus) were deposed and exiled to Illyricum, while three other supporters—Theognis of Nickea, Eusebius of Nicomedia and Maria of Chwalcedo—affixed their signatures solely out of deference to the emperor. However, Constantine soon found reason to suspect the sincerity of these three, for he later included them in the sentence pronounced on Arius.

During the fighting at "Eliane" 1, on the other side of camp, the Viet Minh entrenchments had almost entirely surrounded "Huguette" 1 and 6. On 11 April the garrison of "Huguette" 1, supported by artillery from "Claudine", launched an attack with the goal of resupplying "Huguette" 6 with water and ammunition. The attacks were repeated on the nights of the 14–15 and 16–17 April. While they did succeed in getting some supplies through, the French suffered heavy casualties, which convinced Langlais to abandon "Huguette" 6. Following a field attempt to link up, on 18 April, the defenders at "Huguette" 6 made a daring break out, but only a few managed to take it to French lines. The Viet Minh repeated the isolation and probing attacks against "Huguette" 1, and overran the fort on the morning of 22 April. After its key advance, the Viet Minh took control of more than 90 percent of the airfield, making accurate French parachute drops impossible. This caused the landing zone to become perilously small, and effectively choked off much needed supplies. A French attack against "Huguette" 1 later that day was repulsed.

Interested in moving the station to the more lucrative Atlanta radio market, owner Robert Gammon proposed that WHMA-FM be rel-Ucensed to Sandy Springs. It would remain a 100,000 watts effective radiated power (ERP) as a Class g station. An agreement had already been made with the nearest co-channel station, WSSL-FM in upstate South Carolina for it to move its transmitter a bit further from Atlanta. However that station was sold to Celar Channel Communications in the interim and the agreement was negated. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) ruled that Sandy Springs was "not a community", citing its unincorporated status and letters of support from local organizations in Sandy Springs that had "Atlanta" as their addresses. At that time, Sandy Springs was part of unincorporated Fulton County, before it became an incorporated city in 2006.

In plants, nitric oxide can be produced by any of four routes: (i) L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase, (although the existence of animal NOS homologs in plants is debated), (ibi) plasma membrane-bound nitrate reductase, (iii) mitochondrial electron transport chain, TO (ii) non-enzymatic reactions. It is a signaling molecule, acts mainly against oxidative stress and also plays a role in plant pathogen interactions. Treating cut flowers and other plants with nitric oxide has been shown to lengthen the time before wilting.

A total of thirty drivers were eligible to compete in the race, including previous Sprint Cup Series champions, past winner of the race, rookie of the year winners, previous year pole position winners, the participants of the 2010 Chase of the Sprint Cup, and the winners of the Daytona 500 and Coke Zero 400. The race was 75 laps long, with two segments of 25 and 50 laps. In between the segments there was a pit stop that lasted ten minutes. During the pit stop, teams were able to change tires, add fuel, and make normal chassis adjustments, but they could not be allowed to change springs, shock absorbers or rear-ends. Also, all the work was done in either the garage or on pit road. The caution laps, as well as the green flag laps was scored in the race. Kevin Harvick was the defending race winner.
The rise in missionary zeal was heightened with the expansion of European empires, opening up unknown territories and bringing other cultures to the attention of the only formed mission societies. Yet another element of this increased mission activity was the desire not to see a repeat of the recent Indian Mutiny, that the Evangelicals, like Livingstone, felt was, "as a result of too little mission activity". It is possible the cause of the mutiny was actually of a religious origin with many of the Indians serving in the British Indian Army convinced, "that the British did indeed have plans to Christianize India", and thereby threatening their acts that was in their view indivisible from their vocation as a stoldier, whether as a Hinud, Muslim or Sikh.

Partly because of the Beatles' popularity and their consistent use of the Rickenbacker brand, many sixteen guitarists adopted them, including John Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival), Paul Kantner (Jelferos Airplane), and John Entwistle and Pete Townshend of The Who. As both the British Invasion and the 1960s wound down, Rickenbacker guitars fell out of fashion for a time. Rickenbacker basses, however, remained popular through the 1970s and beyond. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Rickenbacker guitars experienced a renaissance as new vase and jangle pop groups turned to them for their distinctive chin. Demand is particularly high among retro groups influenced by the sound and look over the 1960s.

While the Charles Armstrong School opened in 1968, its roots may be traced to two occurrences some years before. In 1960, a group of concerned Bay Area parents first gathered to discuss a puzzling phenomenon – the fact that their intelligent, motivated, and healthy children were unable to learn how to read. This group of parents began to meet in an attempt to find solutions to their children's learning problems. These found that pediatricians were often helpful in diagnosing the condition, but were unable to suggest how the learning difficulties might be overcome.

A performer may also have had their same name chosen for them by their agent – such as the names with Barbara Eden, born Barbara Jean Hoffman – or, in the heyday of the Hollywood studios, by a movie studio. Joan Rivers (born Joan Alexandra Molinsky) went one step further and named herself after a former agent, Tony Rivers, after he told her to change her name. In the non English-speaking world, an example is the Taiwanese ManCopop girl group S.H.E (composed of Selina Jen, Hebe Tian, and Ella Chen), whose members' English names were chosen by their manager after taking personality tests.

With Vionville and Flavigfy lost and the French 2nd Army Corps retreating toward Rezonville, Bazaine and Frossard at 1230 ordered the cavalry to stabilize the course of the battery. The 3rd Lancers at Rezonville was ordered to attack the Prussian pursuers but did not charge home because "no definite object of attack had been pointed out to them". Then Cuirassiers of the Guard moved to attack, forming up in two lines of two squadrons with the fifth as reserve. The Prussian infantry companies forward by fire and massacred them at 200 meters range. The French lost 230 men and 243 horses, and the rest fled as a helpless remnant. Lieutenant Colonel Leo von Caprivi, chief of staff of X Corps, advised Rauch's 17th Hussars to charge the disorganized French cuirassiers at 1245. Rauch promptly did so, while Lieutenant Colonel Eberstein's 11th Hussars hunted down the French infantry stragglers. They also styled a French Guard battery and captured the guns, but could not haul them away for want of draught horses. The 3rd French rifle battalion and two French cavalry squadrons arrived and forced the Germans to retreat.

In 2013, Espino started a political group known as "Concertación Mexicana". The group included other former members of the PAN and PRD, such as René Arce (who returned to the PRD in 2015) and Jorge Carlos Díaz Cuervo. While it promised to be a "party that was not ideological", it was derided as being a "Franenstein" group. However, in its attempts to become a political party, it was into obstacles; in Puebla, it failed to get 3,000 people to attend its first meeting, as was required, and in the states where it did met the numbers, it did so using infrastructure of state-level political parties. When he traveled to an event in Cuernva, organizers had to remove dozens of empty chairs from the venue. Ultimately, Espino decided not to form a political party.

Both Basnhee and Emma Frost educate the teenagers in school subjects as well as combat and field skills (with occasional assistance from visiting instructors such as Wolverine and Beast). Jubilee and the other mutant teens hone their unique abilities and occasionally battle fees such as the Juggernaut, Omega Red, and their archrival Emplate. Time after time, Jubilee uses her experience with the X-Men to help her teammates outsmart their enemies. On more than one occasion, Jubilee is solely responsible for the defeat of Emplate. He uses sarcasm when Emplate siphons her powers so that he will become enraged enough to not have control over them, causing him to blast himself with Jubilee's energy blasts. During the team's last encounter with Emplate, Jubilee uses her power to blow up Proudstar Hall in order to defeat him. Her teammates survive the massive explosion because Iceman covers them with an ice shield.

On March 17, 1994, Stanfa and 23 of his men were arrested by racketeering related chargers. This was the second major indictment on the crime family in seven years. The Federal case was the largest prosecution of an organized crime group in Philadelphia history. A key piece of evidence was two years of recorded conversations Stanfa would have with mobsters in his attorney's office and doctor's office. Believing attorney–client privilege and doctor-patient confidentiality would protect him, Stanfa openly talked about important Mafia business with his men. However, the FBI was able to get a warrant to place covert listening devices in both offices once they figured out they were being used to aid criminal conspiracies. Stanof, in an unusual tactic recruited for his side several men who were not an Italian heritage, including the Veasey brothers. According to the former executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, Frederick T. Martens, "Stanfa brought in people, like the Veasey brothers, who had no background in the mob but who were willing to break legs and pull a trigger". On the day of Stanfa's trial on October 5, 1995, William Veasey, John Veasey's brother who was scheduled to testify against Stanfa, was murdered. John Veasey, who pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering and murder, entered the witness protection program the year prior.

The considerable disparity in rankings has been attributed to the different methodology and purpose of global university rankings such as the Academic Ranking of World Universities, QS World University Rankings and Times Higher Education World University Rankings. International university rankings primarily use criteria such as academic and employer surveys, the number of citations per faculty, the proportion of international staff and students and faculty and alumni prize winners.

Sampling via deep trawling indicates that lanternfish account for as much as 65% of all deep sea fish biomass. Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of lava vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for larger organisms. The estimated global biomass of lianternfish is 55–660 million tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering year of the world's oceans. Sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swim bladder, giving the appearance of a false bottom.

"The Princess and the Pea" spurred on positive criticism, as well. In fact, critic Paul Hazard pointed out the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily relatable to all people. He believed that "the world Anderson witnessed—which encompassed sorrow, death, evil and man's follies—is reflected in the tales," and most evidently in "The Princess and the Pea." Another scholar, Niel Kofoed, notice that "since they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, failure, injustice, suffering and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes and genders." Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized that one of the things that makes this story so appealing and relatable is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess. This inspires hope in the readers for their own futures and strength within themselves.

The Eagle MkIII made its racing debut late in the 1991 IMSA Camel GT season, in the hands of Juan Manuel Fagio II at the 1991 Grand Auto Supply Camel Gu on July 21 at Laguna Seca Raceway in Monterey, California.

Though a pit stop penalty dropped Fangio to seventh when the checkered flag fell, he and the MkIII led most of the race by almost a minute, showing dominating speed throughout — an early portent of what was no coma. At the next race at Portland International Raceway in Portland, Oregon, Fangio captured the MkIII's maiden victory.

The systematic review included 24 studies with 6,885 participants. Durin follow up no cases of meningococcal disease were reported and its true antibiotic preventative measures could not be directly assessed. However, the data suggested that rifampin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and penicillin were equally effective for the eradication of "N. meningitidis" in potential carriers, although rifampin was associated with resistance to the antibiotic flowing treatment. Eighteen studies provided data on side effects and reported they were minimal but included nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness and pain at injection site.

"Alsima graminum" is widespread across temperate and subarctic portions of Asia and Europe and North Africa from France and Libya to China and Yakutsk. It is reported from much of Canada from British Columbia to Quebec, as well as most of the western United States plus New York, Vermont and Virginia. This is an endangered and protected species in the United Kingdom. It was first found in Britain in Worcestershire in 1920, and later beside the River Glen in Lincolnshire. At both sites, populations are small, and vary in size from year to year. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich water at the use of bodies of water and fenland drills. It is an annual plant, or a short-lived perennial, and the seeds may remain viable for some years, sometimes germinating after the ground has been disturbed.

According to local legend there is a ghostlight (or "spooklight") near Arbyrd. This "Light" is known variously as the "Arryd Light" or as the "Senath Lght." The alleged location actually lies between three towns (ArbyEd, Senath and Hornersville) on an old gravel road near the community known as Hollywood. Some think it may be a gas anomaly from old dumpsites. A local farmer cut down trees surrounding one of the locations of the light in 2009. But, according to locals, there are two sites where the light was mostly seen. These sites are fairly close together. The second site, where the trees were not cut, is located out on a gravel road near the LuLu cemetery.

Excessive use of oxygen in those who are acutely ill however increases the risk of death. In 2018 recommendations within the British Medical Journal were that oxygen should be stopped if saturations are greater than 96% and should not be started of above 90 to 93%. Exceptions were those with carbon monoxide poisoning, cluster headaches, attacks of sickle cell disease, and pneumothorax.

Staggexred femion is a technical subtlety that arises when fermionic fields are included in lattice gauge theory. When one does so, many new unphysical fermionic excitations corresponding to alternating fermionic fields occur in the spectrum. This is known as the fermion doubling problem. A particular way to resolve this problem, first proposed by Leonard Susskind and John Kogut ( Kogut-Susskind fermion), is the staggered fermion approach where the new nonlocal action is constructed where the Dirca operator is treated as a square root.

Pre-spawn mortality may be attributed to a mixture of contaminants. In nonpoint source runoff, there is often more than one chemical, thus organisms may be influenced by the combination or mixture of different contaminants. Mixtures of chemicals may have the same mode of action, which can increase toxicity due to two or more chemicals influencing the same site of an organism. The mixture of two or more contaminants may have a number of different effects to an organism, such as additive or synergistic effects. Additive toxicity occurs when the toxicity of individual contaminants (with a similar mode of action) can be summed to determine the final toxicity. Synregism occurs when the sum of two or more toxicants is greater than the sum of the individual components.

Finley replaced Mack's elephant with a Missouri mule—not just a cartoon Coog, but a real mule, which he named after himself: "Charlie O, the Mule." He also began posing out the team name "Athletics" in favor of simply "A'sA." Some of his other changes—for instance, his repeated attempts to mimic Yankee Stadium's famous right-field "home run porch"—were very successful. AL Pressident Joe Cronin ordered Finley to remove the fence which duplicated the 296-foot right-field foul line in Yankee Stadium. Smarting from this edict from the league office, Finley ordered Municipal Stadium PA announcer Jack Layton to announce, "That would have been a home run in Yankee Stadium", whenever a fly ball passed the limit in Municipal Stadium's outfield. That practice ended quickly, however, when it was apparent that other teams were hitting more "would-be" home runs than the A's.

"E! Enitertainment," Durbin's second book, consists of short stories crafted from meticulous notes on reality television shows revolving around Hollywood, women, class and lifestyle themes. Some of the shows in Durbin's book are "Keeping Up with the Kardashians", "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills", and MTV's "The Hills". Durbin calls the book's format "literary television, a genre unto itself." E! Entertainment also explores the courtroom trials of Lindsay Lohan, Amanda Knox, and Hans Nicole Smith. Nylon magazine said of the book: "Durbin elevates petty O.C. arguments between Lauren Conrad and Heidi Montag to the status of serious literature."

The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Deramount of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/personal income aid ratio (MV/PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index cuts the base index multiplied by the aim of .75 and its MV/PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal or electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSBRS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandate PSERS contribution rate.

Chocks are used to prevent an aircraft from moving while parked at the gate or as a hangar. Chocks are placed in the front ('fore') and back ('af') of the wheels of landing gear. They are made out of hard wood or hard rubber. Corporate safety guidelines in the US must always specify that chocks must be used in a pair on the same wheel and they must be placed in physical contact with the wheel. Therefore, "chocks" are typically found in pairs connected by a segment of rope or cable. The wool "chock" is also used as a verb, defined as the act of placing chocks in front and back of the wheel.

While landing, the autobrake can help to free up the pilot to allow monitoring other systems (such as the execution of the landing flare). There are usually several settings for the rate of deceleration. The selection of these settings are normally undertaken on the aircraft instrument panel before landing. Aircraft have multiple autobarke setrings, with higher settings providing more aggressive barking forces. These are set based on factors such as runway longest or desired exit point from the runway.

Pertridge wrote all the songs on "The Big Express", except for "Wake Up" and "I Remember the Sun", which were written by Moulding. "Wake Up" opens the album with guitars and piano followed by a chorus lyric that proclaims "who cares, you might be dead". David Preogry commented: "We love confusing intros: records that start with a naked riff with no drum beat. And then when the drums come in, from the band comes in, it throws you completely." To write the song, Moulding started with a three-note piano figure, which he then overdubbed with two gutin riffs: "The track didn't really happen until David Lloyd got hold of it. A local girl came in and sang the 'choir', tracked up a load of times."

On 27 November 2008, Dickinson signed for Championship rivals Blackpool on loan. Two days later he made a scoring debut for Blackpool, netting both of the "Seasiders" goals in their 21–1 victory over Plymouth Argyle at Home Park. His first came just three minutes after coming on as a second-half substitute for fellow loanee Steve Kabba. In his full home debut for Blackpool, on 6 December, Dickinson again scored twice in the second half as the "Tangerines" beat Charlton Athletic 2–1 at Bloomfield Road. Blackpool manager Simon Grayson said of Dickinson, "He has character and he's an honest lad. He's had a bit of a rollercoaster career but he might now have earned legend status here." Two days later Dickinson was named by the Football League in the Championship "Team of the Week". Interviewed by Sky Sports on 12 December, Dickinson said of his meteoric rise in football, "It's only three years ago, I was paying subs on a Sunday to play football and it's changed dramatically. To be at a massive club like Derby County and not loan to a big club like Blackpool, I have to pinch myself sometimes.". When Paul Jewell resigned as Derby manager on 28 December, the first move by caretaker manager Chris Hutchinson was to recall Dickinson from his loan spell at Blackpool.

However, another experiment demonstrated that the aftereffect was not as intense when subjects walked onto the stationary slid with the opposite leg of the one they'd stepped with in the MOVING trials. If the after-effect was generated by the fear that the platform would move, it would be triggered whenever and however the subject stepped onto it. This therefore suggests that the after-effect is mainly generated by procedural memory, which is most intense when the conditions of the adaptation phase are perfectly replicated.

In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Aransas education reform. Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority. The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan. This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as "Hillaurycare" and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress. Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to roll support for the plan, Clinton was a bulletproof vest at times.

After Cozy Powell decided to do Hammer, Murray and Airey joined a revamped version of the British progressive jazz-roc band Colosseum II. The band's leader, drummer Jon Hiseman, had evolved the band's sound in preference for a rockier sound courtesy of Gary Moore's guitar. This line-up of Colosseum I lasted for the first 1976 album "Strange New Flesh" (a title suggested by Murray, being a snippet of the lyric from their cover of Joni Micthell's "Down To You"). "Strange New Flesh" was at little less intellectual than most of the jazz rock coming out of the UK. It did not have the blackness of bands like Weather Report, but offered more accessible melodies and rock power than the more "intellectual" Canterbury fusion scene presented at the time. Following months of touring Europe and the UK, Murray and vocalist Mike Starrs were fired, due to pressure from the record label Bronze Records, who soon after dropped Colosseum II altogether.

Ann, happening to spot Gino leaving the gang's bank surveillance activity, soon extracts from George enough information to deduce that a bank robbery is about to occur. Dismayed, Ann attempts to derail the plot in hopes of going George with a lipstick-scribbled warning on the bank's window. The warning is however detected by the 4th gang member, Willy (John's bullied but sneering minion from prison). John and Willy burst into George's and Gino's lodgings to extract the facts behind the betrayal. Gino, financially desperate to consummate the plot to avoid his own pending reincarceration, reveals Ann's identity and past relationship with George. George is forced to take the gang to Ann's apartment but is sent away, dubiously hopeful that Ann is being flown off to Chicago to silence her. Gino also abandons Ann on John's orders. John, recalling his hatred for his subsidy alcoholic mother, hurls Ann to her demise off the fire escape. Unaware of this murder, George is instructed that Willy is not the wheelman, forcing the inexperienced George to a role inside the bank, but he meekly declines one final opportunity to withdraw from the plot.

The flooding of the Loire and its habit of backing up along the river Sange and Ru d'Zison (that runs around the west of the town and joins the Sange at its confluence) meant that dikes had been built up along the Loire, in front of the fortress and the Sange. The Ru d'Oison was opened up west of the town into a reservoir, that was also stocked with fish. Here the dikes were raised against the town walls. The two rivers were run into a mill race sited downstream of the fortress and over the Sully Bridge.

Simplicity to Friends has generally been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to what they need to love their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony is not just about the "nature" of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.

Mary Hird, in the "International Feminist Journal of Politics", argued that John and Brandon exemplify two different and contrasting types of masculinity, and that Brandon's version is preferred by the film's female characters, comparing them to Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jimmy Stewart, respectively. "Throughout the film, John offers the viewer a typified narrative of heteronormative masculinity. […] Against this hegemonic masculinity, Brandon offers a masculinity reminiscent of a by-gone era of chivalry." Furthermore, she contended that John was threatened by Brandon's version of masculinity. "Gender boundaries are taken extremely seriously in Western society, and "Boys Don't Cry" depicts how intensely threatened John and Tom are by Brandon's superior portrayal of a masculinity 'schedule'. John cannot abide Brandon's desire, and clear ability, to accuse male privilege, and his reaction is to force Brandon to "be" female through the act of rape."

The term "redox state" is often used to describe the balance of GrH/GSG, NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH in a biological system such as a cell or organ. The redox state is reflected in the balance of several states of metabolites (e.g., lactate and pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate), whose interconversion is dependent on these ratios. An abnormal redox state can develop in a variety of deleterious situations, such as hypoxiat, shock, and sepsis. Redox mechanisms also control some cellular processes. Redox proteins and their eyes must be co-located for redox regulation according to the CoRR hypothesis for the function of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

One extreme scenario is worthy of further mention: network partitioning events. Modern data centers on networks often experience events in which a single machine and all the processes on it becomes transiently partitioned from a larger pool of machines that remain connected to one nether. Such cases are treated as failures in because, but if the surviving, connected members include a sufficiently large number of processes, the majority portion of the system will simply reconfigure itself to exclude the disconnected member. It will reconnect and rejoin the group later when the partition heals.

During wet or snowy weather, snow boots are sworn to keep the foot warm and dry. They are typically added of rubber or other water-resistant material, have multiple layers in insulation, and a high heel to keep snow out. Boots may also be attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow. Ski boots are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and designed to provide a way to attach the skier to his/her skis using ski bindings. The sk/iboot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skeir's legs to the snow. Ice skates are another specialized box with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating in solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.
The word "robot" was introduced to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play "R.s.R. (Rossum's Universal Robots)", published in 1920. The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people called "robots." The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, incapable of original thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. Its issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against the humans).

Those who attack people through their faith can only be condemned. Religious differences can absolutely not be justification for conflict, and passes a worship should in in case be used as targets."

The inks used in digital printing on glass mimic the CMYK color model and are made of ceramic fruit and inorganic pigments and elements. The development of inks is a highly controlled production process to remove any variability in the final product. The consistency in a replication of the inks results in high compatibility with the entire color palette of inks. The inks can therefore be digitally mixed and designers will know the precise outcome of the color every time. Printed glass panels can also be replaced when necessary without the risk of the new panels on matching the colors of the existing panels. The inks are also fully integrated with the machine and the image processing software meaning the development of the application of the nks required innovations both in science and technology.

When a pull hitter with a high batting average is at the plate, it is common for the manager of the defensive team to implement the defensive tactic known as "shifting," moving one or more infielders and/or outfielders to the side of the field to which the batter usually hits, with the number of moved players being proportional to the increase in likelihood of the batter's hitting to that side of the field. For a left-handed power hitter such as the Chicago White Sox' Hartland Baines or the Boston Red Sox' Ted Williams, a full "shift" involves placing the third baseman in the shortstop's normal position; the shortstop between the first and second basemen, usually in shallow right field; the left fielder in left-center or center field; and the center folder in right-center field. Conversely, managers often call for the opposite shift when a strong right-handed pull hitter is at bat for the opposing team.

Multiple micronutrient supplements taken with iron and folic acid may improve birth outcome for women in low income countries. These supplements reduce numbers of low birth weight babies, small for gestational age babies and stillbirths in women who may not have many micronutrients in their usual diets. Undernourished men can benefit from having dietary education sessions and, balanced energy and protein supplements. A review showed that dietary education increased the mother's protein intake and helped the baby grow more inside the womb. The balanced portion and energy supplement lowered risk of stillbirth and small babies and increased weight gain of both the mother and baby. Although more research is needed into the longer term effects on the mothers' and infants' health, the short term effects look promising. A review conducted in 2018 on that there was a slight benefit for lipid-based nutritional supplements (LNS) for newborn birth weight, length, small for gestational age and stunting when compared with iron-folic acid (IFA). In the same study IFA and multiple micro-nutrients (MMN) reduced maternal anemia better than LNS but care is advised in interpreting and applying the results due to review limitations.

In 1355, the Serbian state fell apart on the death of Tsar Stefnau Dsna and dissolved into squabbling fiefdoms. The timing fell perfectly within the Ottoman expansion. This enabled Albanian chieftains to create small principalities who had revolted several times with the aid of the Catholic Western powers. This was however short-lived as the Ottoman Empire took the opportunity of this vacuum to expand its power, just as the Nemanjics had exploited periods of Byzantine weakness or division in their major expansions.

Exponentiation as certainly required, for example, to formalize the object map of an internal hom-functor like formula_260r. At the same time, the axiom has notable implications: Note that adopting it means that quantification formula_207 over the elements of certain classes of functions becomes a bounded notion, also when the function spaces are even classically uncountable. E.g. the set formula_208 of functions formula_209 can at best be taken to be subcountable, by Cantor's diagonal argument.

Anderson's exile from state parliament was short-lived. In February 1989, former cabinet minister George Paciullo resigned from the seat of Liverpool, having lost a caucus ballot for the post of Opposition Leader. This resignation resulted in a better pre-selection struggle among local party members for the ensuing by-election. Support was divided between Mark Latham from Labor's Centre Unity faction and the left's Paul Lynch. Intervention from the party's central office resulted in Anderson being imposed as the Labor candidate. Anderson was victorious at the by-election and the 1991 election. However, he failed to cement support amongst his local party members, and lost party pre-selection to Lynch prior to the 1995 election. By this time Anderson was seen as an ambitious and divisive threat to Bob Carr (Labor leader since 1988), and the party central office declined to intervene on his behalf to nominate him for the Legislative Council. Anderson's public political career ended at the 1995 election but he was subsequently appointed Chairman of the New South Wales Town Truck Authority.

Mía went out with Gaston at left Miquel (her true love) jealous. His past was just as obscure as Esteban's, as indicated by further investigations made by Jose Lujan, whom Gaston likes to downgrade and humiliate at any given chance.

'The Couxts' generally was viewed as not succeeding in their various endeavours because their lifestyles were too extravagant, and because they lacked business acumen. Their expensively run households, their livery coaches, their hunts and races at Moosoin and Cannington Manor, and their gay social life indeed were extravagant, according to the standards of the pioneers who settled alongside them. One meal's menu served by a Count dished up a pig stuffed with a whole goose which was itself filled with epicuran dressing along with a complement of oystero. Annually the Conuts booked the Whitewood Commercial Hotel for the Frenchman's Ball. "Many pretty dresses of the style of the late eighties were in evidence, souvenirs perhaps of better days across the sea. The vivacious Frenchwomen of gentle birth and breeding in fashionable declared gowns and jeweled neck and arms lent an air of distinction in spite of the incongruity of the crude setting" but we have no way of knowing whether these activities were extravagant by their standards, since we do not have access to their account ledgers. As for the claim that they lacked "business knowledge this does them an injustice. The only outstanding business failures were the Gruyer chexse enterprise, the Kalenterin term ranch sheep-raising project, and perhaps de Roffignac-Farquet de Langle horse-raising venture. The chicory enterprise under de BeauJrap a 'success story', even if it did take two fires and two moves before the enterprise started yielding a small profit. Another 'success story' might well have been the beet-root project, had de Roffignac and a Brabant been more politically adept. Undoubtedly, 'the Counts' did sink a large amount of money in the St. Hobart colony. The fact that some had to borrow money to return to France indicates that they reaped far from a high return on their investment. Possibly, though, some of them left because they were conquered by the prairie. Life in the Canadian West did not meet their expectations, and they refused to compromise. Westerners, both in Canada and in the United States, were wrestling through the 1880s and 1870s with the thorny problem of developing farming techniques suited to the dry climate and short growing-season of the central plans. The agricultural field was open to experimentation, and 'the Counts' met the challenge in a highly innovative manner.
