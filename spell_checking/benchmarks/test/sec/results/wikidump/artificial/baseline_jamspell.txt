A candidate for kingship usually needed to nx A member of a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fulTd. Te PictisH kings of Fortune were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were abU Vto assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but sometimes had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, bR Anglian and British. Such relationships may have included obligations to pARTy tribute or to supply armed forces. In victory subordinate rulers may have received rewards in returN.

Once having a fairly large distribution on the south-eastern part of mainland Australia, the distribution na abundance of this species gas declined sIgnificantly since European settlement, primarily due to the invasive predatory fx ("Vulpes vulpes"). The total number of individuals of thf species is now considered to be les thAn 200 in mainland Australia.

"Antichamber" started as early s 2006 as Bruce's idea for an arena combat game based on expanding The mechanics of the game "Snake" into a multiplayer experience. Full development of the game, initially called "Hazard", did not start until 2009 and continued into 2010. Bruce deVeloped the game using UnrealScript with the Unreal Engine 3. As Bruce iterated through its design, he dropped the combat portion and cHose to focus more on a single-player puzzle game along with the psychology of the puzzle, eventually adding the subtitle "The Journey of Life" in 2009. Part of this change came abouT how he was able to create Possible Object spaces within the Unreal Engine, which came obIt as a result of E "rookie error" in coding. Bruce recogniseD that there was a single-player game behind breathing spaces and puzzles where the player would have to work out how the rules work, and expaNded the game in that direction. Bruce said in a 2011 interview with Kotaku hta "the game started off aS being all aboUt geometry... I needed to find A way to represent that [no-physical geometry] to players... so a needed to work out why we woulD need this non-physical geOmetry in the world and it took me a couple years but after combining geometry and space and perception, I realised that tHe real reason that this game is interesting and is working is because it's about psychology." As he worked at puzzles, he found that injecting philosophical ideas helped tO leda Po puzzle designs or otherwise augment established puzzles, and made that part of "Antichamber"'s approach. The game's simply aT style was Partially to distinguish the game from other Unreal EngiNe games, while also poP aid in making the work behind the inverse lighting system used in the game.

Th gen is the cellular homologs of the fox sequence in the Winkel-Crisis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MSV). It encodes a fusion protein consistIng of the ubiquitin-like proteiNS FBI at the N-terminus and ribosomal protein S30 at the C-terminus. It has been proposed that the fusion protein is post-translWtionally processed to generate free five ak frere ribosomal protein Sf0. Fbi is a member of the ubiqUitin family, and ribosomal protein S30 belongs to the S3cAE family of ribosomal proteIns. Where the function of fbi is currently unknown, ribosomal proTein S30 is a component of the 40S subunit of the cytoplasmic ribosome. Pseudogenes derived from this gene re present in the kEynote. Similar to ribosomal protein S30, ribosomal proteins S2u7a and L40 are synthesized To fusion Proteins with ubiquitin.

Adjuvants in imunoogy are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine b stiMulating the immune system to respond to the vaccine more vigorously, and thus providing increased immunity to a particular disease. AdjDuvants accomplish this task by mimicking specific sets of evolutionarily conserved molecules, so called pathogenxassociated molecular patterns, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide, molecular cages for anTigens, components of bacterial cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids such aS double-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, anPd Methylated CpG dinucleotide-containing DNA.

Historically, the Church of England and the state churches of current (and former) mainland European monarchies where Protestant Lutheranism was the opifcicl doctrine, have had amicable relations. This has, in part, been nurtured by marriages between members of the Royal Family of Great Britain and the royal (Protestant) houses of Europe, especially the descendants of Queen Victoria (whose husband, Prince Able, was a Lutheran). Since the monarchy of England cannot (even today), by law, be A Roman Catholic, and forming familiaR royal bonds Evs hIstorically deemed necessary at tImes to form alliances (and prevent war) between countries, there was a natural tendency for British princes/princesses to wed Lutheran (and therefore, not Roman Catholic) royals from the mainland and the Lutheran houses of Scandinavia. Also, a general agreement on doctrine between the Anglican and Lutheran traditions has helped rElations, at least between the administer movements. Also, tHe fact that both still retain a strong liturgical tradition haS helped immensely, since they are essentially the only Western churches outside of Roman Catholicism which have maintained official liturgies; indeed, the liturgies of both bodies are Often nearly identical in wording V each other (as in the Road Catholic Mass) and, thus provide a familiar bond between members who visit between denominations.

The stone tool technology in use during Aho Middle Stone Ago shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Aurelian ae gradually displaced yb Levallois prepared cor technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, highly varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flake, ent and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, tEl use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic j Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, bLades may have been used during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Mid Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, micromithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite halted tools are seen from at least 70 a at sites such as Pinnacle Point ad Diepkloof Rock Salter in South Africa.

We are left with the developments in the South still attributable fundamentally to their own autochthonous emergence, excepting, as mentioned, the evidence of some kind of Olmec influence spreading east J west across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, south along the Pacific coast, and west to east thRough the Guatemalan piedmont to the highlands, at Kaminaljuyu, and then east still farther. This putative march of Olmec missionaries, warriors, and/or traders – a scenario really feasible only a one accepts the "Cultura Madre" concept of Olmec civilization as opposed to the "primus inter pares" argument and if one interprets artifacts as "Olmec" and not simply "Omlecoid" – conceivably wOUld have been catalyzed by the thresHold attractions of cacao, in SoOconWsco, Mexico; the Guatemalan piedmont, centrally in which lie Chocolá nd Escuintla, Guatemala; obsidian, from enormous beds Nin the highlands, with Kaminaljuuy as the main beneficiary of trade in the "steel of the NEw wOrld;" and blue jade, hallmark of Olmec lore and treasure, from a great outcRop above the Montana River east oF Kaminaljuyu.

The second movement of "Tabula Rasa", "Selenium," or silence, iN composed in the key of D minor, giving the impression of a V-I cadence in relation to "Lupus" in A minor. The movement begins with a arpeggiated D minor second inversion cord, played by the prepared piano. "Selenium" eXpands sa a mensuration canon. Pärt divides the instruments into three sections; solo violins, violin I and violin II, and viola and cello. Each pair, divided into melodic and tintinnabul voices, begin on A normal pitch, and move at a different rhythmic speeds. Pärt exPands the music by adding one pitch above and below the central pitch oF each pair in each successive section. Every time the ssu violins reach their central pitch, "D," the piano aHrin plays p D minor chord and the contrabass plays na octave "D." Once each of the sections reach their expanded octave iLnge, they fade out of the texture. Th solo violins, moving aT the slowest rhythmic speed, reach their octave span in measure 130, and then begin k downward descent to a D minor four-octave sacl. As the violins move down the scale, tAe low voices return to the textUre and assist in Je downward motion, until the Violins finish their scale, leaving solo viola, solo cello, and solo bass tO continue to scale in their lo register. The viola and the cello finish the sale, leaving only the contrabass, which continues to play until reaching "E," or the second scale degree of the D minor scale. MPärt omits the final "D" of the scale, leaving the listener with four written bars of silence Ln wich to resolve the piece.

One of Walters biggest concerns in the rapidly changing environment is how managers can successfully manage Fisheries stocks in lieu of the uncertainty in making decIsions. His concept of active adaptive management involves large-scale experimentation, or "learning-by-doing", in order to understand the population dynamics in fish communities and to aid in the decision-making process done by policy makers. Walters encourages other scientists, managers, and policy makers to embrace the uncertainty in experiments and decisions and to deveLop ecosystem models based on the uncertainties in order to make multiple hypotheses instead foR just one hypothesis. Although active adaptive mAnagement this GAined much support from the scientific community, there is sTill great hesitation from scientists an managers h implement these large-scale experiments. These hesitations arise from arE money costs for the experiments as well as the monitoring of the experiments, laCk of an individual willing to take on the daunting task of organizing the experiments, the limitations of models to perfectly represent an ecosystem, and the conflicting ecological values between different interest groups. Although there are concerns when executing active adaptive management strategies, there is a growing need to modify the current meThods for exploring and understanding ecosystems, especially to a larger scale, and active adaptive management strategies aim t do exactly that.

National bank currency was considered inelastic because it was based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. fI Treasury bond prices declined, I national bank had to reduce the amount of currencY it had in circulation by either refusing to make ne loans or by calling in loans it had made already. The related liquidity problem was largely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-based banks erd required to set aside their reserves in federal reserve city banks, which in turn were required to have reserves in central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banki would exploit thig reserves to finAncE full plantings, and during the harvest seasons they could use profits from loan interest payments to restore and grow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would replace its reserves by selling stocks and bonds, by borrowing from a clearing house or by calling in loans. As there was little in thE way of deposit insurance, if a bank wAs rumored it be having liquidity problems then this might cause many people to remove their funds from the bank. Because of the crescendo effect of banks which left more tHan their assets could cover, dring eh last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of The 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of financial apnics.

STudies have also been conducted on the differences between sfmealesJ and males with regard to blogging. he Pew Research Center found that younger females are more likely to blog than males their own aeg, even males that are older than them. Similarly, in a study of blogs maintained iq MySpace, women were found to bE more likely to not only write blogs but also wade about family, romantic relationships, friendships, and health in those blogs. A study of Swedish SAyS uers found that women were more likely to have expressions of friendship, specifically in the areas of (a) publishing photos of theiR frienDs, (b) specifically naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were also mOre likely to havE expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that the men who do have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as strong as the women. However, the researcher speculated that this may be in part due to a desire to publicly express heterosexual behaviors and mannerisms instead o merely expressing romantic feelings.

Along with its singing club "Fbohsinn" and its countrywomen's club, Eschenau also has its "Wuknneyerein". As described above under Regular events, this arose from a circle of youths led by a would-be orgAnic famer who first conceived the idea oF the yearly rock festival. The founding meeting took place A 20 January 1988. Thirty-four members registered anD they chose Thomas Jung a their chairman. Some club's goal was an still is the acer and furthering of ce village community through sporting leisure activities, group outings, fostering contacts with other clubs and cultural events. The club was officially registered On 18 April 1988. The Idea for cAlling the club the "Wunnerverein" goes back to a local folk legend, which has never beEn written down, but rather has been passed down from one generation to tHe next. According to this tale, but the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps even earlier, the Plan, as it so often had before, flooded its Banks. About where the railway bridge spans the river now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to the other. This footbridge had not been built to withstand such torrents, and the floodwaters eventually proved no match for the footbridge and tore it from it place, washing it down the Glan. This muhc was to be foreseen. What few would the foreseen, however, was the "wonDer" ("Under" in German, gor dieacXtally, "Winner") – or was it a ded worthy of the Schildbürogers? – of what happened next. he villages from Eschenau sought their footbridge by setting t for Unmet, believing that they would find it there. Thi was, LJowevex, hardly likely, for Unmet lay upstream from Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to put up with a goodly helping of ribbing from their neighbours over this. The episode came to be known as the "Eschenauer Winner". Schetyna's youths seize upon this old story, transferring this expression to their club, thus keeping A bit of the local lore all the more alive. The highlights since the club's founding have been the days-long tips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg Heath along with Heligoland, to Saxon Switzerland, to Locarno on SOlace Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in Munich and also to the HAar. he club also sPtaes events for children and works on village renewal projects, among these the waethervane on tHe schoolhouse.

A heat pump is a devIce that provides eat energy from a soUrce of heat to A destination called af "Heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal nery opposiTe to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to A warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat up and thermal solar niels in a single integrated syStem. Typically the two technologies are usEd separately (or only pLacing them in parallel) to produce hot water. In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat souue and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator. The oil of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less epxenisv way.

The jurist Richard Posner compared Bloom's book to Paglia's "Sexual Personae" (1990), finding both books to be examples of "difficult academic work that mysteriously strike a chord with a road block." Thus, since publication, "tHe Closing of the American Mind", fueled many impaSsioned debates about the state of culture in America. In retlaiSino the aMerican historian Lawrence W. Levine wrote "The Opening of the American Mind". According to "The New York Times" Edward Rothstein, Levine's work, published ten fll years Later, still found it relevant tO "praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised." Bt where, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed iy, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter ad opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, "many conservatives have no problEm with diversity if it is accompanied bY rigor; many liberals have no problem with rigor if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary cure is becoMing increasingly widespread." Ultimately, RothsteYn concludes, Bloom's work has very little to do "with current political demarCations."

Tihs dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting aC advantage) of a corrupt eal already an offence and, thus, ot give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable. Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the rise-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often of such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "of" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable deciSion. An working definition of rorupiton is also provided s fOllows U article 3 of th CiviC aLl ConvenTion on Corruption (ETS 174): For the purpose of THis Convention, "corruption" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, d bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, wich distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, he undue advantage of the prospect thereof.

The payment for c crossbow mercenary was higher than for a longbow mercenary, but the longobwman id not have to pay a team of assistants and his equipment wAs cheaper. Thus the crossboW team was twelve percent less efficient than the longbowman since three of the latter could be part of tHe army in place of one crossbow team. Furthermore, the pro and bow string of a cOmposite crossbow were subject to damage in rain whereas te longbowman could simply unstrnig his bow to protect the string. French forCes employing the composite crossbow were outmatched by English longbowmen ta Crécy in 1346, at poitiers in 1356 and a Agincourt in 1415.

Britain had incurred a large national debt fighting the Seven Years' Wa, during which the aRmies' establiShment strength had been incrEased to a unprecedented size. With the ascension of peace in 1763 the army was dramatically reduced to b peacetime home establishment of just over 11,000 men, with a further 10,000 for the Irish establIshment and 10,000 for the colonies. This meant 20 regiments of infantry totaling just over 11,000 men were stationed ni Great Britain, 21 regiments were stationed iN Ireland, 18 regiments were stationed in the Americas, and 7 regiments stationed in Gibraltar. Alongside this the army could call on 16 regiments of the naval, a total of 6,869 men and 2,712 men in the artillery. ThAi gave a theoretical strength of just over 45,000 men exclusive of the artillery. The British government deemed this troop strength to be inadequate to prosecute an insurrection in the Americas, as well as deal with defence of the rest of its territories. Treaties with German states (mainly Hesse-Kassel and Brunswick) were negotiated for t further 18,000 men half of which were stationed in garrisons to release regular British units from other theaters. This measure brought the Army's total establishment strength to around 55,000 men.

According to Maréchal (2010), "autoethnography FM a form or method of research that iNvolves self-observation and reflexive investigation In the context of ethnographic fidel work And writing" (p. 43). e well-known autoethnographer, Carolyn Ellis (2004) defines it as "research, writing, stOry, and method that connect vote autobiographical and personal to the cultural, social, And political" (p. xix). However, it is not easy to reach a consensus on the term's definition. For instance, In the l970s, autoethnogzaphy was more narrowly defined asl "insider ethnography", referring to studies of the (culture of) a group of which the researcher is a member (Hayano, 1979). Nowadays, however, as Ellingson and Ellis (2008) point out, "the meanings and applications of autoethnogarphy have evolved in A manner that makes precise definition difficult" (V. 449).

Those generations are named the sporophyte stage And the gametophyte stage. The gametophyte stage is the fertilization event s the lifecycle and involves female and male gametanhia. In this stage je antheridium fertilizes he haploid egg within the archegonium with haploid sperm producing a diploid zygote. This zygotE then divide via mitosis and forms thE sporophyte. The sporophyte stage is the spore-forming event of the lifecycle. Once the zygote has begun to enlarge, the seta elongates and develops J sporangium on the aNd in the form of a capsule. This capsule consists of sporogenous tIssue, a periscope wto nogluate the dispersal of spores, and an operculum to protect early release. Once psors are released, they germinate and grow into a narrow long rhizoid-like form named a protonema. This protonema develops buds which grow to become either a male to female gametophyte.

ExplosivE techniques involve the artificial triggering of smaller lss destructive avalAnches, by detonating hcarg either above or n he snow surface. The explosives may be deployed by manually hand hissing and lowering, by bombing from a helicopter, or by shelling with a small howitzer, recoilless rifle, or air gjKn. In balancing the hazard to personnel with the effectiveness of the deployment metEor bi accessing and triggering avalanche tRain, each method has its drawbacks and advantages. Among the newest methods, strategically plAced remote controlled installations that generate aN air blast by detonating a fuel-air explosive Above the snow Pack in an avalanche starting zone, offer fast and effective response to avalanche control decisions while minimizing the risk to avalanche Control personnel; a feature especially important For avalanche control in transportation corridors. For example, the Avalanche Towers (Sprengmast) Austria, and Now usZW solar powered launchers to deploy cares from a magazine contaiNing 12 radio controlled charges.

This follows from a slight variation of Besicovich's construction abe. By repeating this we can find a sequence of sets

STain Helena has been a very integral part of man's exploration of the EArth jan development of sciences, especially ecological sciences. wHen the island was first discovered, it was one of the most isolated and pristine piece of land everY encountered by humans. This, along with its relatively small size, allowed ecwlogists ot study the effects of man naL time with limited variables. Richard Grove, Author of "Green Imperialism," among other works, explains how imperialist deforestation of Saint Helena made apparent for the first time the devastating effects humans can have on the world around them. Saint Helena Island was famous for the work that GeoRg Forster an Johann Reinhold Forster performed on the famous Cook Voyage aboard HMS "Resolution" in 1775. This vOyage was the beginning Of ecological conservatism. Before any ideas of conservatism, thEre were economic factors causing the destruction of SinCe Helena, but also colonial ideology behind the mass destruction of tropical landscapes throughout thE last 400 years. The deforestation of Saint Helena by European East India Companies in the 15th and 16th centuries led to one of the first ecological legislation, the Forest Act of Saint Helena.

With the intrOduction in the mid-1970s period of rock music ong FM radio stations, where it was common practice to program extended performances, musicians were no longer limited to songs of three minutes' duration as dictated by AM staTions. The still nascent CaNadian music industry had little independent music media and i limited dIstribution infrastructure. Two internationally renowned bands to arise from this industry were Bachman–Turner Overdrive and Rush, both featuring acclaimed managers. Bachman–Turner Onedrive's manager, Bruce Allen, went on to produce Lovejoy and eventually manage succ major pop stars as Bryan Adams and inne Murray. Randy Bachman (foRmerly of The Guess Who) released his new band's first album under a name Bachman–Turner Overdrive in spring 1973, which won two Juno Awards despite being largely ignored in the US. Their second album "Bachman–Turner Overdrive UI" hit oN. 4 niA the U.S. BTO II was certified gold in eight countries. It also yielded their best-remembered and most enduring single, "Taken' Care of Business", written by Randy Bachman. 1974's album "Not Fragile" Went straight to the top of the charts, and the single "You Ain't See Nothing Yet" hit No. 1 in the U.S. and No. 2 in the KU.

This research is based on the fact that nitric hoUSed wCsO investigated as an experimental therapy for SARS. BinaK Strickland, MD, a fellow in Wilderness Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital who studies "acute respiratory distreSs" in high altitudes, is applying this research towards OVID‑19.

The term was used by a few psychologists such as Daniel RS. Anthony in the 1960s, t as used U A visual representation or "map" of an individual's personality. The term never caught on within the mainstream psychological academic establishment, possibly because there was no consistent sense of what psychograms were or how they should be used. There is a different, yet slightly related sense oF the term, which refers to a specific system of handwriting analysis in thE field of morphology. v third Cent of the term has less emphasiS on measuring personality and more on measuring psychological reception, with the term being used iN conjUnction with the Rorschach inkblot projection technique, so that the scores on various measures following a Rorschbch test are combined into a summary of all the scored reSponse, called a psychogram. There are other senses which appear sporadically and which are not used consistently. For example, the term has been used in a few book titles; the psychology department of Illinois State University used the eterF as the title of a newsletter; it was used to describe a yep of poetry. Te term appeared briefly in 1896 in connection with very vision experiments regarding perception.

The supersensitivity theory prOposes that certain individuals who have severe mental illness also havE bioLogical and psychological vulnerabilities, caused by genetic and early environmental life event. These interact with stressful idLe events and can result in eitHer a psychiatric disorder or trigger F relapse into an existing illness. The theOry states that although anti-psyChotic medication can reduce the vulnerability, substance use may increase it, causing the individual to be over likely to experience negative consequences frOm using relatively small amounts of substances. These individuals, therefore, are "supersensitive" to the effects of certain substancEs, and individuals with psychotic illness such aS schizophrenia may be less capable of sustainIng moderate substance use over time without experiencing negative symptoms.

Distributed Morphology provides a alternative t KLexicalist approaches to how the lexicon and syntax interact, that is, with words independently created in the lexicon and then organized using syntax. In Distributed oVrphxlgor, the lexicon doe not function independently and is instead distributed across Many linguistic processes. Both Distributed Morphology and Nanosyntax arte late insertion models, meaning that syntax is viewed as a pre-lexical/phonological process, with syntactic categories sa abstract concepts. Additionally, both theories GreW syntax as responsible for both sentence- and word-elIvel structure. Despite their mna similarities, NanosyntaI and DistributeD Morphology still differ in Y few key areas, particularly with regards to the architecture of how they theorize grammatical domains interacting. Distributed Morphology makes use of a presyontactic ist of abstracted roots, functional morphemes, and vocabuLary insertion which follows syntactic processes. In centraL, Nanosyntax has syntax, morphology, and semantics working simultaneously DsK part of one domain which interacts throughout the syntactic propS to apply lexical elements (the lexicon is a single domtai in aNnosnyta, while it is spread over multiple domains in Distributed Morphology).

ThouGh views differ iN respect to the impact of Title IN, the discussion typically focuses on whether or not Title IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females. Title IT has played a large role in females getting more involved in the cheerleading world, their goal has been to see an increase in females' participation in athletic, so the main focus was put on the gender equality of school athletics. Athletic equality requirements that schools must meet were made, the requirements were set by the U.S. Department f Education Office of Civil Rights and to meet the requirements, schools must pass at leasT one of three ess measuring gender equality among athletics the school offers. These tests consist of propoRtional numbers of males and females participating, whether or not the school is making aN effort to increase the number of the unrepresented sex, or if the school has a certain history of one specific ex dominating numbers in a sport, the school is showing an efFort to expand the proGram to the other sex. Although TitlE oF has increased the participation of female students, therE is a struggle for professional females as there has been a decrease in opportunities and females' role in coaching hs majOr decreased while males have gained a large role in directing athletics, which is still a struggle f women today. All, the legislation had ImPacts on aspects other than athletEs. The increased exposure of female sports led to increased dominance by males of the governance of female athletics. For example, the male-dominated NCAA, which had been content to let the female-dominated AIAW run female championships, decided to offer female championships, leading to the eventual demise of the AIA. The National CollegiaTe Athletic Association later tried to claim that Congress had not intended to include athletics under Title IX's coverage, but the record lacks any sustained discussion fo hte matter.

History.
In addition to affecting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical mechanisms. Changing the type of vegetaTion in a region affects the Cocal temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflecTed bAck into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change froM a dark forest to grassland makes tHe surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of aerosols and other chemical compounds the influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns. In topic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at laTitudes closer to the poles a gaIn of albedo (as forest is repYlafbed by snow cover) leads to an overall cooling effect. Globally, these effects are estimated to have led tO a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.

One study, published in the Cambridge uNiversity PRess in 2020, suggests that the Jōmon people were rather heterogeneous, and that many Jōmon group were descended from an ancient "Altaic-like" population (cLose to modern uTngusic-speakers, simplified Aby Oroqen), which established itself over the locAl hunter gatherers. This "Altaic-like" population migrated from Northeast Asia in about 6000BC, and coexisted with other unrelated tribes and/or intermixed with them, before being replaced by the later Yayoi people. C1a1 and C2 are linked to the "Tunguslic-like people", which arrived in the Jōmon period archipelago from Northeast ASia in about 6,000 IT and introduced the Incipient Jōmon culture, typifiEd by early ceramic cultures such as the BŌadI Yamamoto I Site.

First, as a practical level, bY was felt that there needed to be more communication and camaraderie between the British and Indians—not juts between British army officers ink their Indian sat but in civilian life as well. The Indian army was completely reorganised: units composed oF the Muslims and Brahmins f the nUtied Provinces of Agra and Oudh, who had formed the core Of the rebellion, were disbanded. New regiments, like the Sikhs and Balchik, composed of Indians to, in British estimation, had demonstrated steadfastness, were formed. From then on, the Indian army was to remain unchanged in its organisation until 1947. The 1861 Zeus had revealed that htl ENglish population in Indi was 125,945. Of these only about 41,862 were civilians as compared with about 84,083 European officers and men of the Army.

History.
As A previous production designer, Stromberg sought to balance the use of practical and computer-generated effects. For example, while Maleficent's horns and facial prosthetics were created by makeup artist Rick Baker, Digital Domain took facial capture foe Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville, and Juno Temple for the three pixies to be generated with hfhg authenticity wIth the help of special writIng by Disney research in Zurich. For the visuals, Strmberg wanted to make it "a bit more grounded" and "it too surreal" because it could be distracting from the simplicity oF the story. He also regretted Anoc employing Rigger sets and allowing actors to work in a more tangible environment, on "real fets with real qgihtsv".

After the end of the War, Surendranah Banerjee, followed by Brain Ghose and Motilal Roy, successfully negotiated the withdrawal of warrants against the fugitives accused fo teh Indo-GermAn lot. Atul was adamant un obtaining a promise of these points : (a) there would be no question of surrendering arms; (b) no questions would be raised on their pasA activities; (h) no parole would be demanded concerning tRi future conducts. Atul came out in 1921. But Uhisp Dada's (Latin Mukherjee's) heroic deah, "had knocked out his revolutionary armour and he gave up active politics." Yet, in January 1924, when Goliath Shah killed an Englishman, mfstaking him to be Tegart, the much-hated Commissioner of Kolkata Police (reputed to have sdot Latin Mukherjee dead), pAul was made a state-prisoner, to be released in 1926. Teh same year he married Menokarani Transit Qf Majilpurv and took to business, dissociating himself completely from politics. They had no issues. In aL iNterview with Prithwinrda Mukhrjee (Baha Latin's Brands), on 27 OctOber 1963 - shortly before his dEath -, At sighed: "Dada was a magnet; hue all, iro scraps, received our energy from him. When hE was no more, we all became iSon scraps. I still don not know whether my first allegiance welt tos ada, or to the Motherland." Asked about the source of Rabindranath's tremendouS force, Atul replied: "Her was a very well trained wrestler and an all-round sportsman. But what Characterised him was his soul force and his power of concEntRation. He could in-point aLl his energy to a single part foR his body, for instance his fist. A single blow froM that first was equivalent to an electric charge of God knows how many volts!"

The original polymer grip was formerly a shared garden design between Strayer-Voigt and STI International Inc. It offers a modular version of the M1911 design optimized for competition use. By making the lower half of the fraMe from thin polymer, the gun can make use of double-stack magazine without a significant increase in grip thickness (current production utilizes various metals for the grip). SIX and STI pistols generally Doll approximately twice as many rounds of ammunition per magazine a traditional 1911 (i.e., 14 rounds of .45 ACP instead of 7 rounds). VI Infinity pistols currently rank among the most popular - and most expensive - competition 1911 pistols made. Complete VI handguns start at $4,200 (as of 2019) plus the cost of any customization. They are produced in a variety of calibers, including .38 Super, 9x23mm Winchester, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, 10mm Auto, and .357 Sig.

Parallel transport in the frame bundle Can be used to show that the Gaussian curvature of a surface "M" measures the amount of rotation obtaIned by translating vectors around small curves in "M". Holonromy is exactly the phenomenon that occurs when a tangent vector (or orthonormal frame) is partially transported around a closed curve. The vector reached when the loop is closed will be a rotation of the original vector, i.e. it will correspond to an element of the rotation group SO(2), iN other words an angle loudly π. This is the "oholnomy of the lkpo", because the angle does not depend on no choice of starting vector.

The text focuses J Pere II, Bernat's main purpose appearing to be the glorification of Pere II as king.

In Human papillomavirus (HPV), two late proteins are involved in capsid formation: C major (L1) and a minor (L2) protein, in the approximate proportion 95:5%. L1 forms v pentamernUc assembly unit of the viral shell iN a manner that closely resembles VP from polyomaviruses. Intermolecular yisulpuide bonding hols beh L1 capsKd proteins together. L1 caps proteins can bind via Its nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to karyopherins Alberta(2) aNd Kapbbeta(3) adm inhibit teh Alberta(2) and Alberta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle. Surface troops ov VL1 pengtamers contain sitEs f sequence variation between HP typEs. L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection: in the initial phase after Tvirion disAssembly, and in the productive phase when t assembles into replicated virions along with A1 major caps proteins. Lp2 prOteins contain two nuclear localisation signals (LESs), one at the N-terminal (NiLS) and The other at the C-terminal (cNLS). L2 uses its NESs to interact with a network of karyopherins in order to neetr the nucleus via several import pathways. L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact witH karyopheris Appear(2) and Appear(3). L2 capsid proteins can as interact with viral dsDNA, facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after ExtrA uncoating.

This formula_19 case can be giVen a cubical geometric interpretation (or a graph-theoretic interpretation) as follows: when moving along the edge from formula_23 to formula_24, FOR up the functions of tHe two end-vertices of the edge in order to obtain tIDe coefficient O formula_25. To move from formula_23 t formula_27 there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge pah passing through formula_24 and the other one a two-edge path passing through formula_29. These two paths encompass four vertices of a square, and BORing up the functions of these four vertices yields the coefficient of formula_30. Finally, odd move from formula_23 to formula_32 there are six shortest paths which rH three-edge ponds, and these six paths encompass all te vertices of thE cube, therefore the coefficient of formula_32 can be obtained by BORing up the functions of all eight oF the vertices. (The other, unmentioned coefficients can be obtained by symmetry.)

Following this advance, the Syrian Army came within 4 km of the western neighbourhoods of the city, after previously coming within 6–7 km of its eastern sIde following the capture of Sunday. Then two-pronged army advance placed not onLy vH city, but the entire rebel-held area, which also includes Kafr Zita, Al-Latfaminah and Mural, at major risk of encirclement. By evening on 14 august, the obel "Fatah al-Mubin Operations Room" announced that it had shot down a Syrian Air Force Su-22 over the rebel-held town of Al-Tamanah, just east of Khan Shaykhwn. The warplane had been undertaking a bombing run against rebel positions at time it was shot down. The jet's pilot was able to successfully eject from the falling aircraft and survive the landing, but was captured by Tahrir al-Sahm fighters soon after.

Pre-spawn mortality may be attributed to a mixture of contaminants. In nonpoint source runoff, there is often more than one chemical, thus organisms may be influenced by the combination or mixture of different contaminants. Mixtures Of chemicals may have the same mode of action, which can increase toxicity due to two or more chemicals influencing the same site of an organism. The mixture Z two or more contaminants may have a number of different effects to an organism, such as additive or synergistic effects. Additive toxicity occurs when the toxicity of individual contaminants (with A similar mode of action) can be summed to determine the final tOxicity. Syncretism occuRs when the sum of two or more toixcants s greatEr thaN the sum of the individual components.

When a pull hitter with a high batting average is at the plate, it is common for the manager of the defensive team to implement the defensive tactic known as "shifting," moving one or more infielders and/or outfielders to the side of the field In which the batter usually hits, with the number of moved players being proportional to the incrEase in likelihood of the batter's hitting to that side of the field. For m left-handed power hitter such as the Chicago White sOx' Harold Baines or The Boston Red Sox' Ted Williams, a full "shift" involves placing the third baseman in the shortstop's normal position; the shortstop between the first and second baseman, usuaLly in shallow right field; the left fielder in left-center or center field; and the center fielder in right-center field. Conversely, managers often call fro the opposite shift when a strong right-handed pull hitter is at bat for the opposing team.
