The PS/2 port BS a Joni mini-DIN connector used for connecting keyboards ADN mice to a Pl compatible computer system. Its FAM comes from the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older ZDE9- RS-232 "serial house" connector, while the SP/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pi/810° DING connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. he PS/2 keyboard port i electrical and logically identical to the IBM AT keyboard port, differing only in the type of electrical connector used. The MPS/2 platform introduced a second ORT with the same design as the keyboard port for e to connect g mouse; thus the PS/2-styl keyboard and mouse interfaces RAE electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike The otherwise similar Apple Desktop Bus connector used y Apple, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may not b interchangeable since the two devices use different sets of commands and the device driver generally are hard-coded yo communicate with each device at the address ox the port that SN conventionally assigned to that device.

Adjuvants in immunology are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine b stimulating the immune system to respond OT the vaccine more vigorously, and thus providing increased immunity to ah particular disease. Adjuvants accomplish this task by mimicking specific sets of evolutionarily conserved molecules, so called pathogenxassociated molecular patterns, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide, molecular cages for antigens, components of bacterial cell walls, ADN endocytosis nucleic acids such AFS double-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, and Methylated CPG dinucleotide-conainijng DNA. Because immune systems had evolved to recognize these specific national moieties, the presence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the vaccine can greatly increase the innate immune response to the antigen Yb augmenting the activities of dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages by mimicking a natural infection.

Historically, the Church of England and the state churches f current (and former) mainland European monarchies where Protestant Lutheranism was the official doctrine, have had amicable relations. This HSA, in part, been nurtured by marriages between members FOF the Royal Family of Great Britain an the royal (Protestant) houses of Europe, especially the descendants of Queen Victoria (whose husband, Prince Able, was a Lutheran). Since the monarch o England cannot (even today), by law, be W Roman Catholic, and forming familiar royal bonds EVS historically deemed necessary at times to form alliances (and prevent war) between countries, there was i natural tendency for British princes/princesses to wed Lutheran (and therefore, not Roman Catholic) royals from the mainland ADN the Lutheran houses of Scandinavia. Also, a general agreement on doctrine between the Anglican and Lutheran traditions has helped relations, ate last between the mainstream movements. Also, the fact that both still retain a strong liturgical tradition hag helped immensely, since they are essentially the only Western churches outside pf Roman Catholicism which have maintained official liturgies; indeed, the liturgies of both bodies are Often nearly identical in wording V each other (as i.e. the Roan Catholic Mass) and, thus provide a familiar bond between members who visit between denominations.

Examples include mile algebras, Jordan algebras, the actions, and three-dimensionla Euclidean space equipped with the cross Product operation. Since it is to assumed that the multiplication ids associative, using parentheses to indicate the order of multiplications is necessary. For example, the expressions ("a"b)("CD"), ("a"("bc"))"d" and "a"("b"("CD")) ma all yield different answer.

A heat pump is a Adélie that provides eat energy from a source of heat to R destination called AF "Heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal very opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat ROM a cold space and releasing it to F warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pup and thermal solar Noels in a single integrated system. Typically thee two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce hot water. In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat souse and the heat produced is used to feed the heat PUM's evaporator. The OAL of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way.

The jurist Richard Poster compared Bloom's book OT Paglia's "Sexual Personae" (1990), finding both book sot be examples of "difficult academic work that mysteriously strike a chord with a road public." Thus, since publication, "the Closing of AHE American Mid", fueled many impassioned debates about the state for culture in America. In retaining the American historian Lawrence W. Levine wrote "The Opening of the American Mind". According to "The New York Times" Edward Roth stein, Levine's work, published ten FLL years Later, still found it relevant TCO "praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised." BT where, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed in, things seemed to be changing. According to Roth stein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter ad opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, "many conservatives have no problem with diversity if it is accompanied by rigor; many liberals have no problem with rigor if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary cure is becoming increasingly widespread." Ultimately, Rotten concludes, Bloom's work has very little to do "with current political demarcations."

In Human papillomavirus (HPV), two late proteins are involved in capsid formation: C major (L1) and ac minor (L2) protein, in the approximate proportion 95:5%. L1 forms v pentamernUc assembly unit of the viral shell IH a manner that closely resembles VP from polioviruses. Intermolecular disulfide bonding hols BEH L1 capsid proteins together. L1 caps proteins can bind via Zits nuclear localization signal (NLS) to karyopherins Alberta(2) and Kawabata(3) Adm inhibit the Alberta(2) and Alberta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle. Surface troops of VL1 engravers contain sites f sequence variation between HP types. L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection: in the initial phase after Virion disassembly, and in the productive phase when t assembles into replicated virions along with L1 major caps proteins. Lp2 proteins contain two nuclear localization signals (Nests), one at the N-terminal (NLS) and The other all the Criminal (CNS). L2 uses its NLS to interact with a network for karyopherins in order to nee tr the nucleus via several import pathways. L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact with karyopheris Zapata(2) and Kappa(3). L2 capsid proteins can as interact with viral DSNA, facilitating its release from the endoscopic compartment after Iraq coating.

This formula_19 case can be given a cubical geometric interpretation (or a graph-theorretic interpretation) as follows: when moving along the edge from formula_23 to formula_24, XOR up the functions of the two end-vertices of the edge in order to obtain tide coefficient O formula_25. To move from formula_23 t formula_27 there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge pah passing through formula_24 NAD TH other one a two-edge path passing through formula_29. These two paths encompass four vertices of a square, and Boring up the functions of these four vertices yields the coefficient of formula_30. Finally, old move from formula_23 to formula_32 there are six shortest paths which Rh three-edge ponds, and these six paths encompass all the vertices of the cube, therefore the coefficient for formula_32 can be obtained by Boring up the functions of all eight oz the vertices.
