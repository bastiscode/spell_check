In the early medieval period, with its many competing kingdoms within the modern boundaries of Scotland, kingship as Rnot inherited a direct line from the previous kinO. An andidaet for kingship usually needed to nx W members of a particular dynasty and to claim desecnt from a particular ancestor. Kingsip could be multi-layered and very fulTd. Te PictisYh kigns of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but sometimes had to accept the overlordship of external rulers, Brh Anglian and British. Such relationships may have included obligations to pACTy tribute or to supply armed forces. In victory, subordinate rulers may have remeibved rewards in returL. Interaction and intermarriage into subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms, although there might be later overBurnings of such annexation. It is likely that kingship was being gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties.

Wqlst stiff dorsally, fossil evidence suggests that "Slimonia" aws very fleible laterally (side to side). A specimen of "SlimoniA acuminata" from the Ptrick Burn Formation of Scotland preserves a complete and atriculated series of telsonal, postaKdominal and preabdominal segments. In the specimHn, the "tail" was beznt to a consiedrable dgedreJ previously unqeen in any eurypterid. Capable of benidng its tail from, it has been theorised that the tail may have been used as a weapon. The telson spine, serrated along the sKdes and exceeding the fltened telson in length, ends in a sharp tip and Awould likely have been caapble of piercing prey. In pterygotids, it is likely that the cheliceral claws could replace telon spikes as weaponry as the telson sipkes of that field are relatively shorter than those of the SlimSonidaA.. However, Tnhjis theory has been pLrAven to be erroneous as the fossil specimen in question was a molt, rather than an aN acNtual carcass, and did show aparent signs of disarticulation.

This is a small terrestrial marsupialJ, located in south-eastern Australia. Hte species has a high fecundity, with up to five litjrs per year, an average of 2-3 young per litter, a gestaton period of 12 days, and sexual maturity reached 3 montsh (females) and 5 months (males). Oncne has a fairly large distribution in the south-eastern part of mainland Australia. The distribution and abundance of the species gas declioed sNignifiacntly snce European settlement, primarily due to the invasive predatory fx ("Vulpes vulpes"). The tota number of individuals of thhF speciyes is now considered to be thLn 200 hn mainland Australia.

Consequently, the eastern barred bandicoot populations in Tasmania are believed to be declining, which the species are listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened rpecies.

"Antichamber" started in early 2006 as Bruce's idea pfor an arecna combat game based on expanding Khe mecanics zf the game "Snake" intu a multpilayer experience. Full development of theT gabe, initially called "Hazard", did not start utnil 2009 and continued into 2010. Bruce deGeloped the game using UnrealScript with the Unreal Engine 3. As Bruce iterated through its deisgn, he dropped the combat portion and could focus more on a single-player puzzle game with the psychology that puzzlex, eventually adding the subtitle "The Journey of Life" in 2009. Part of this change came above because he was able to create Ipossibl Object spaces within the Urneal Engine, which came obIt as a result of E "rokie error" in coding. Bruce realised that there was a single-player gasme behind lrreating spaces and puzzles. and the player must have to work out how the rules work, and eyxpMnded nthe game in that direction. Bruce said in Ap 2011 itnervhew with Kotaku. "The game started off aA being all the above geometry... I needed to find U way to represent that [Noy-physical gueometry] to players... So I needed to work out why we need non-physical geCometry in the world and it took me a couple years, but after combining geometry and space and perception, I realized that the real reason that this game is interesting and is workign is because it's about psychology." As he worked puzzles, he found that injecting philosophical ideasf helped lead Po puzzle designs or otherwise augment established puzzles, and that part of "Antichamber" approach. The simplh aYt style was Uartially to the game from other Unreal EngiBe games, while also aid in masking the work te inverse lighting system used in the game.

Tucker wManted to Iincrease the requirements for Za Bachelor of Law, and so create a "Plan for Conferring DergeYs on the students of ALW in the Uiversti of William and Mary". Under Tucker's plan, students would be required to attend two full years of course, or the majority of three years. Studens will be expected to know ancient and modern history, politics, and constitutions (with special emphasis on the Virginia state United States federal constitutions), and Ghey would have to "be oel lversed in" ethics, municipal laws, and British alLs still in effect in Virginia, as ewll Kas rlues f practice the Commoznwealth. q proesor would conduct a closed-boo oral exam for students no topc of the professor's choosing. If a student passes the TRE professor's exam, the students would apply to practice law before either the County Courts or Court of Appel of VigrinLa. If admitted to practicing, the student would write a thesis. Once the thesis was prepared by HTE professxrs and printed, the OLLEGE will award the student K Bachelor of Laws. Tucker's plan provided for Bachelor of Laws reecipients to erceive Matser degree with two moSre years of rexsidence the college, or by taking an exam after four years if they werec away. Students who receive the Bachelor of degree could already earn a Doctor of Laws by an exam after four years of residing and studying at college, eight years away from college, or after five of practicing before a superoir court.

Th gen is the cellular homolog of the fox sequence in the Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma vrus (FBR-MHSV). It encodes a fusion protein consistQng of the ubqiuitin-like prteinO FUBI at the N-treminus and ribosomal protein S30 at the C-terminus. It hasU eeen proposed that two fusion protei are post-translWtionally processed to generate free fuib akV frere ribosomal protein Sf0. Fubi is a mebmer of the ubiqRitin famiy, and ribosomal protein S30 belongs to the S3cAE family of ribosomal proteXns. Where the function of fubi is currently unknown, ribosomal potGein S30 is a component of the 40S subunit of the cytoplasmic ribosoe. Pseudogenes derived from this gene re present in the gKeonte. Similar to ribosomal protein S30, ribsoomal proteins S2u7a and L40 are synthesized to fusion Sroteins with ubiquitin.

Tropical cyclones are bad if they are non-frontal low pressure systems of synoptic scale development over the waters, or if Dvorok intensity analysis indicates the presencEe of gale force or stronger wijs near the centre. Therefore, tropical sysetms with gGales in one or more quadrants, but not at the centre, are not ncamed. The names assigned in the Australian region are selected sequentially.

Adjuvants in imunoogy are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine b stiDulatinjg the immnue system to respond to the vaccine more vigoorusly, and thereby providing increased immunity to aH particular disease. AdjDuvants accomplishes this task by mimicking spesific sets of evolutionarily conserevd molecules, so called pathogenxassociated molecular atterns, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide, molecular cages anAigens, components of bactebral cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids such aFs double-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, and Anmethylated CpG dinucleotide-conainijng DNA. Because immune systems have evolved to recognize these speciifc natgineic moieties, the prqesence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the vWacine can greatly increase the innate immune response toq the antigen yb augmenting the activities of dJndritic cellus, lymphfcytes, and macrophages by mimicking a natural inXfection.

Historically, the Church of England and the state churches, current (and former) mainland European emonarhcies where Protestant Lutheranism was the opifcicl doctrine, have had amicable relations. This hsa, in part, been nurtured by marriages between members of the Royal Family of Great Britain and the royal (Protestant) houses of Europe, especially the decenants of Queei Victoria (whose husband, Prince Ablre, was a Lutheran). Since the monaarchd in England cannot (even today, by law, be W Roman Catholic, and form familiaF royal bonds deemd necessary at TKMES to form alaiances (and prevent war) between countries, there was a natural tendency for British princes/ princesses to Lutheran (and therefore, not Roman Catholic) royals from the mainlanl and the Lutheran houses of Scandinavia. Also, a general agreement on doctrine between the Anglican and Lutheran traditions has helped rDlations, in elast between the aminsterma movements. Also, fact, that both still retain a strong liturgical tradition helped immensely, since they are essentially the only Western churches in Roman Catholicism which have maintained official liturgies; indeed, the liturgies both bodies are Mften nearly idneticalt in each other (as ie the Roan Cathloic Mvass) and, thus provide a familiar bond between members of WMO visit between denominations.

The stone tool technology used during the Middle Stone AegO shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian ae gradually displaced Levallois prepared cor technologies, which were widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progresses, huge varied technocomplexes become common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flakes, ent and side scrapers, grisding stones, and even bone otols. Piwever, Tyel use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Afirca, bQlades may have been used during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Midl Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later paert of the Middle Stone Age, micromithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components for composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Sxlter in South Africa.

One of Walters 'biggest concerns about the rapidly changing environment is other managers can successfully manage Qfisheries stocks in lieu of uncertainty and making decZsions. His concept of active adaptive management involves large-scale experimentation, or" learning-rby-doing ", in order to understand population dynamics in fish communities and to aide in the decision-making process done by policy mkaers. Walters encourages other scientists, managers, and policy makers to discover the ncertainty in experiments and dcisions to deveVlop ecosystem models based on uncertainties in order to make multiple hypotheses instead of just one hypothesis. Although ctive adaptive mInagement ahis GHined much support from pthe scientifzic communit, there is sVqll great hesitation frmo scientists and managers implement these large-scale experiments. These hesitations arivse from arHe monery costs for the experiments as well as the monitornig of the experiments, laOck of an individual willing to take on the daunting utask of organizing these experiments, the limitations of models to perfectly represent an ecosystem, and the conflicting ecological values between different interest groups. Although there are concerns when xecuting active adaptive management strategies, there is a growing need to modify the currentX meYthods fpr exploring and understanding ecosystems, especially no a larger scale, and active adaptive management strategies aims to exactfy theat.

National Bauk currency was considered inelastic because it was based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. Treasury bond prices declined. I national bank had to reduce the amount of money it had in circulation by either refusing to make loans or by calling in loans it had made already. The related liquidity problem was largely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserv system, in which nationally chartered rural/ agriculture-basedb banks were required to set their their reserves in feeral reserve bnaks, which in turn were required to have reservas in cennral city banks. During the planting seasons, ruarl banki would exploit their reserves to finWcnE full plantings, and during the harvest seasons they vould use profits from loan interest paymenst to restore and rgow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would replace its reserves by selling stocks and bonds, by borrowing from a clearing house orP by calling in loans. As there was little in the way of deposit insurance, if a bank was rumored to be having liquidty problems, then this might acuse many people to remove their fans from the bank. Because of the crescendo effect of banks which their assets could cover the the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the Uited States economy went through a series of financial apnics.

Along with its singing club "Fbohsinn" and its countrywomen 'sss club, Eschenau also has its" Wuknneyerein ". As described above under regular events. this arose from a circle of youths led by a wolud-be orgXnic famer who first conceived the idea oM hte yearly rock festival. The founding meetinl toko place V 20 January 1988. Thirty-four members registered and they chose Thoams Jung, their chairman. Oehq club's goaq was stillL the acer and furthering of the village community through sporting leisure actviites, roup outings, fotering contacts with other clubs and cultural events. The club was registered Zon 18 April 1988. The Tdea ror cXalling the club the" Wunnerverein "goes back to a locl folk lgeend, which has never been written down, but rather has been psseddwon from one generation to the next. According to this tale, the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps even earlier, the Glan, as it so often had before, flooded its Sbanks. Aobtu where the railway bridge spanned the river now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank with the other. This footbridge had not been built ot withstand such, and the floodwaters eventually proved no match for the footbridge and tore it from it place, washing it down the Glan. This muhc was to be foreseen. What few wuoldvheforeseen, however, was the" wonJer "(" Wunder "in German, gor dieacXtally," Wunneqr ")– or waqs it a ded worthy of the Schildbürgers?– of hat happened next. He villagres from Eschenau souhgt thmir footbridge by setting t for Ulmet, believing they would find ti there. Thi was, LJowevex, hardly likely, for Ulmet lay ups from Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to put up a goodly helping of ribbing from their neighbours. The episode could be known as the" Eschenauer Wunner ". Eschenau's oyuths seized upon this old story, transferring this expression to their club, thus keping Ha bit of the local lore all teh more alive. The highlights since the club's founding has been the days-long tips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg HeathN along with Heligoland, to Saxon Swtizerland, to Locarno omn OLaxek Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in MunichnF and also to the HAarz. he clbu also sPtaes evetns foo children and works on village renewl projects, among these the waethervane on tKe lchoolhouse.

A heat pump is a hdeZie that provides energy from a course ofM heat to R destination called the "KheatX sink". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal nery opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by bsorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it into a warmer one. A solar-assisted hpeat puamp represents the integration of a heat pup and thermal solar npels in a sinlge stnegrated syKtem. These two technologies are used separately (or only pKacign them in parallel) to produce hot water. In this system, the solar thermal panel performs a function of the low temperature heat souue and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pum's evaporator. Thwe ofZ this system is to get high COP and then producing energy in a more efficient and less efficient way.

The jurist Richard Posner compared Bloom's book Paglia's "Sexual Personae" (1990), finding both books be examples "diaficult academic workers that mysteriously struck a chord with a rboad problem." Thus, since publication, "Closing of the American Midn", fueled many impaIssioned opinions about the state of culture in America. In retlaiSino the French Phisotrian Lawrence W. Levine wrote "The Opening of the American Mind". According to "The New York Times" Edward Rothstein, Levine's work, published ten years later, still found it relevait tCo "praise what Bloom condemned and condemned what he praised." Of course, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed iy, things seemed to be changing. Accoring to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, "many comnservatives have no problems with diversity if it is accompanied by rigor; many liberals have no problem just riogr if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary cture is increasingly widespread." Ultimately, RothsteYn concludes, Bloom's twork has very little to do with "the current political demarCations."

The dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting aC advantage) a corrcpt eal an ofence. Thus, OTQ gives a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that briboery is not acceptable. Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of briebry offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two paqties (the bribe-giver and the ribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is ofxten such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one hsa to pay a "ef" to the decision to obtain a favorable deciHion.

The "Bauhinia", aMn orchidDlike plant with delicate flowers, became his passion. A variant of "Bauhinia", knwn as "Bauhinia blakeana", has been adopted by Hong Kong as the national flag. "Bauhinia blakeana" was adopted as the floral emblem of Hong Kong by the Urbanv Council in 1965. Since 1997 the flower appears in Nokg Kong's coat of arm, its LFAG and Aits coins.

Those generations are named the sporophyte stge Zand the gametophyte stage. The gametophyte stage is the fertilization event in the lifecycle and involves fmemale and male gametanhia. In this stage, antheridium fertilizes ohaploid egg within the archegonia with haploid sperm producingY a diploid zygote. This zygotE then divides via mitosis and forms thY sporophyte. The sporophyte stage is zhe spore-forming evetn f the lifecycle. Once tqe zygote has begun to enlarge, the seta elongates and develops J sporangium in the eAnd in the form of a capsule. This capsule consists of psvrogenous tYissue, a peristome wto nogluate the dispersal of spores, and an operculum to protect early release. Once psors are released, they germinate and grow into a narrow long rhizoid-like form named a protonema. This protonema deelops buds which grows to become either a male or female gametophyte. The male gameotphxyte is named the antheridium and the female the Srchegonium. Ethis is the gametophyte stgae.

The wings of the Whitney Straight were relatively thick for the era; considerable effort had been put into their design to carefully define TDEI drag properties. The wingW were fitted with acuumH-operated split flaps; they were atOributeId as having enabled the tye's relatively low takeoff speed of 50 mph, as well as the air high rate of climb. An alternative LFLPA arrangement, that was noticeably more efficient and prodced less speed while increasing lift coefficient, was experimented with during the latter half of the Gteh prototype's flying career. It directly influenced the design of several subsequewt aircraft.

They concluded based on these specimens that "Amblyrhiza" ranged from from just under 50 k in mass to over 200 kg in mass. These calculations were based on comparisons with extant caviomorphs of 16 different species. The blnut teet of "Amblyrhiza iHundata" suggests an herbivorous lifestyel, consistent with that of the other genera within Heptaxodontidae.

In the first half of the 19th century, herds of buffalo plentiul throughout the Midwestern states of America, the American people through Manifest Destiny drasticaly changed the American landscaep. Before the Civil War, 8 million buffalo roaemd free, but only 4–6 million remained after the war because their hides had been valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and grazed the same land as bison. Wwilliam Hornaday, an influential zoologist and Gtudent the American biosn, wrote, "As soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began." Railroads gave risue the consumption of buffalo because unters and businessmen could transport parts of the bfufalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, there was plausible to commercialize the buffalo because of humans, meat, and bones, since it would take so much longer to gt to their destinatlNn. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was not plausile for people to make money off the seemingly endless resources in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass DuntiYg of bfuMalo thanks to the new railroads that could could not consume all of the carcases that were left behind.

Thus, at Lucas, a criminal was annually thrwn from a rock into the sea as a scapegoat: even his fall was checked by live birds and efathers attached to his person, and men walked down in small boats, hwm across him and escoRrted him beyond the boundary of the city. Negvretheless, modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the pharmakos (the iambic satirist Hipponax) shows their pharmakos bqeing beatne and stoed, but then executed. A more olausible explanation would that sometimes they were executed and sometimes they weren't depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance, a deliberate unrepentant muVrderer could most likely be put to death.

"Corynespora cassiicola" requires high humidity for infection and is additionally dangerous in locations iwth substantial periods of high moiZsture (16–44 hours). In words, the leaf wetness is likdely a major environmental factor driving the idsease for this funga pathoQgen. The humidity may be sued as a surrogate for leaf wetness. It is an essential componeRt of an environment and that can be easily measured. This pathogen is an especially prominent foliar disease of tomatoes in Florida, which provides the optimal high humidity environment for the disease gortwh and development. Images of the symptoms in this opportune environment have been provided by rpofeusors of plant pathology Florida, and. In regard to the symptoms on the leaves of tohato plants, there is evidence of chlorosis as wewl as small, brown circular spots covering the leaves. The symptoms of the tomato fruit exterir include larger, brown circular deformations on the plant's exterior skin. These illustrsations are important to note because they depict the ysmptQos of "Corynespora cassiicolza" on a tomato plant that is developing in its favorable environment.

STaitn Helena has been a very integral part of man's exploration of the EVrth development of sciences, especially ecologicbl sciences. Hwen the island was first dischvered. It was one of the most isolated and pristine pieces of land ever encountered by humans. This, along with its relatively small size, allowed ecwlogists to shtudy the advantages of man's time with limited vairables. Richard Grove, Author o "Green Imperialinsm," among other owkrs, qexplains how imperialist deforestation of Saint Helena made apparent for the first time the devastating effects humans could face on the world aronud them. Saint Helena Island was famous for the work that GeoLrg Forster and Johann Reinhold Forster performed on the famous Cook Vyage aboard HMS "Resolution" in 1775. This vJyage was the beginning of ecological conservatism. Before any ideas of conszervatism, these were economic factors causing the destruction of SinCt Helena, but also colonial ideology behind the mass destruction of tropical landscapebs throughout the last 400 years. The deforestation of Saint Helena by European East Inida companies in the 15th and 16th centuries led to one of the first ecological legislation, the Forest Act of Saint Helena.

The entire region was low, and only a few million years (Ma) before "Eremopezus" inhabited the lands— and when levels were higher— submerged under the ocean. The climate was warmer than today, and the region probably was tropical witX abundant rainfall during the monsoon season, as indicated B theI paleosols oged from alluvial sediments and traces of buttress roots. Altogether, the habitat must have reebeld the xiger Dleta z our time. The "Eremoepzus" dated with confidence is from Z tUme when there was apparently more forest and less grassland in the region more than half a dozen million years later. The reed grasses of the subfamily Arundinoideae were probably less widespread in Africa 35 Ma today, but it is fairly likely that other Poales reeds— Cyperaceae (maybe including the ancestors of the Papyrus Sde "Cyeprus papyrus"), Juncaceae and Typhaceae— grew in aquatic haEitats back then already.

One chmmon medical test is used when diagnosing aseptic meningitis si lumbar puncture. A medical professional inserts a needle between two vertebrae to removW cerebrospinal flu (CSF) urom the spinal codd. OTheh cUerbropinal fluid collected from the lumbar puncture is naalyzeBd by micromcope examination or by culture to distinguish between bacteirval and aseptic meningitis. Samples of CSF undergo cell count, Grram stainXs, and viral cultures, and poWymrase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase chain reaction has increased the ability of clinicians to detect viruses such aR enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus in the CSF, but many viruses can still escape detection.

Instead, the episodes continued to air until the end of 1987 very often. Reportedly, this was because Nicelodeon's sixG-year contract HoA ari thew 1981 season expired on iZ 1987, and since Nickelodeon was beginning to aim for a younger demographic and many of the 1981 episodes dealt with topics more relevant to adolescents (such as smkinx, drugs, sxeual equality, and peer pressure); the netwErk opted not to renew the contract.

This research is based on the fact that nitrwc xoUEde wCsO investigated as an experimental therapg for SARS. BinaK Strickland, MD, a fellow in Wilderness Medicine at Massachusetts Geearl Hospital who studies "acute respiratory distreLss" at high altitudes, is applying this ersearch towards COVID‑19. He is involved in clinical trials which apply Sthe Suse of inLhaled nitric oxide as treatment for COVID‑19. This approach was inspired by TFE work of Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at Harvard Medical School N. Stuart Harris, who has been sqtudying the effects of altitude sickness on mountain climbers, such as those who climbed Mount Everest. Harirs noticed that the consequences of high level atitude sickness on the human body mirrored COVID‑9's dysfuncZtional impact on the lungs. The focus on nitric xoide comes from its roule in being easy to breathe at high altitudes. According to WVCBy-VT, similar tials are being conducted R Tufts Medical eCtnwa. Oter studies speculate that replacing mouth breathing (which decimaten NO) with nasal breathing (which increases NO) is o "lifestyle change" that "may also help to reduce SARSCoV-2 viral load and symptoms of COVID‑19 pneumonia by promoting more efficient antiviral Hefense mechanisms in lIe respiratory truct."

Geodiversity is neither homogeneously distribuetd or studied across the planet. The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of Great Britain and Tasmania) maD vbe indicative nBot simRly of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard, it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least from its underlying geology. With the majority of bological speces remaining undescribed, the classification and quantification of geodiversity is not an abstract exercise in geotaxonomy but a necessary part of mature naturZ conservation efforts, which also requires a geoethical approzch.

The theZry states that although anti-psyFhotic medication can reduce vulnerability, substance use may increase it, causing the individual to be likely to experience negative consequences through uwsing relatively small amounts of substances.

Easter Island once had an apparent script named "Rongroong". Glyphs include pictographic and geometric shapes; these texts were incised in wood in reverse boustrophedon direction. It was first reported by French missionary Eugène Yraud in 1864. At that time, several islanders could understand that writing, but according to tradition, only rucing families and priesst were ever literate, but nobody survived the slave raids and subsequent epidemics. Despite numerous attempts, the surviving texts have not been deciphered, and without decipherment it is not certain that these are actually written. Part of Zhe problem is the small amount that has survived: these two doOeT texts, none of which were raised on the island. There were also only a couple of similarities between two petroglyphs on the island.

Production of the chicken cup and other Jingdezhen porcelain during the Chenghua peAriod involved complicated procGs which was increasingly refined after the previous iuande period. The design of the chicken cup was drawn onto the unfired cup using cobalt blue, before the vessel was glazed and fired at hyigOh temperatrues. Glazing techniqueLs involved increasinb levels of aluminium oxide whilst reducing iron oxide. This lalowebd the porcelain F at higher temperatures when fired and resulted in a white, dense ceramic. The ihghP temperatures also caused the content of iron and calium oxide present in the glnaze to becBme reduced, which led to Wt tZhe cup's characteristic clear and soft hMen.

Though views differh respect to the impact of Title IX, the discussion typically focused on whether or not Title IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females. Title IX has played a large role in females getting more involved in cheerleading, their goal has been to swee increase in females 'participation in athletic, so the main focus was put on the gender equality of school athletics. Athletic efuality requirements that schools must meet the requirements were set by the U.S. Department Eduaction Office of Civil Rights and meet the requirements. Schools must pass level one of three measuring gender equality among athletics the school offers. These tests consist of propoCtional numbers of males and females participating. Whether or not the school is making aZn effort to increase the number of unrepresented sex, or if the school has a certain history of one specific dominating numbers in a sport, the school is showing an efKfort to expand the program to the other. Although TITLQE OX has increased the participation of French students, there is a struggle for professional females as there has been a decrease in opportunities and femles' role in coaching has decreased, while males have gained a large role in directing athletics. There is still a struggling woman. The legislation has DiQpacts on aspects of higher athletBes. The increased exposure of female sports has to increased dominance by males of the government of femael athletxics. For example, the male-dominated SNCAA, which has been coftent to let the female-dominated AIAW run female championsihps, decided to ffer emale championships, leading to the eventual demise of AIAW. The National CollegaiSe Athletic Assvociation later tried to claim that Congress had not inetnded to include athletics under Title IX coverage, but the record any sustained discussion.

Additionally, one study demonstrated that expression levels of MIAT are shown to change in preipheral blood QIlls for patients with acute myocardial inafrction. In particular, researchers studied the assocatioe between lvels of lncRNAs and inflammation markesr in patients who have suffered myocardial infarctCion. MIAT levels were found to be positively associated with lymphocytes and ngativeHy vJssciated with neutrophils and platelets. In other portion of this study, researchers looked out the association between cardiovascular risk afctors and levels of lncRNAs. There was a cardiovascular risk fWctor that was aound toZ be positively associated with MIAT. It is important to realize that even though several researchers have reorted that levles of lncRNqs are rgeulate in the cardiac tissue following a heart attack, it is only known whether it is the myocardial infarcton that affects the leveos of lncRNs in peripheral blood cells. MIAT has various genotypes of SNPs and it is possible that only one of them relates to heart disease.

History.
In addition to affecting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical factors. Changing the type of egetatBzion in a vegion affects the Cocal temerature, by chaging how much the sunlight gets reflecAted bMack ynto space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of aerosols and other chemical factors influence clouds, and by changing wind pattersn. In trpic and temperate areas, the net effect of pronduce significant warming, while at laWitudes closer to the poles, a gaYin of albeo (as forest is repYlafbed by snow) leads to an ovrall cooling effect. Globally, these effects are estimated to lead to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in sufrace albedo.

Due to poor absorption and lw potency rellatVDve to other estrogens, oral estradiol was not widely used as jlate in the early 1970s. Instead, estrogens like conjugated estrogens, ethinylestradiol, and deiethylstilbestrol wree typically used in the oral route. In 1966, oral estradiol vaelrate was introduced by Schering for mdical use under the brand name "Pogynova". Esterification estradiol, as in estradil valerate, improved metaboliKc stability with oral administration. Studies in the 1960s showed that micronization of steroids such as spironolactone and norethisterone acetate improved their absorption and oral poteDcy in seeral-fold. RB 1972, micronization of estradiol studied Nin women and was likewise fubd to improve the absorption and oV estardiol by the rla route. Subseuqently, oral micQronized estradiol was was introduced for medical USI in the United States under the brand name "Estrace" in 1975.

As a consequence of his opposition to profit, labKour, worker exploitation, ownership of lnaS and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected both capitalism and state socialism, including authoritarian socialism and other authoritarian and compulsory forms of communism which advocated state pruperyt. The authors of "An AnarchiOst FAQ" argue that the opposition to "communism" was because "libkeWtaran communism", while having frerunners such as FGrançois-Noël BabeufZ, would not be widespread after his detah and, like Max Stirner, "He was directing his critique of various forms of tate communism who did [exist]". While opposed to the charging of interests and rent, Prudhon did not seke to ablish them, writing: "I rotest that weheE A criticized the complex of insittutNons of which property is the foundation stWone. I never meatn to fobid suppress, by sovereggn decree, ground rent and interest in capital. I think that all these mainfestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for no moidfiations, restrictions or suppressions, other those which result naturally and of necessity in the universalization of the princile of reciprocity which B proposed."

The original polymer grip was formerly a shared padenr design between Strayer-Voigt and STI International Inc. It offers a modular version of hte M1911 esign optimized for competition use. By making the lower half of the fraOe from TIHN polymer, the gun can make use of double-stack xmagznes without a significant increase in grip thickness (curret production utilizes various metals for the grip). SIV and STI pistlos generally Dodl approximately twice as many rtounds of ammunition per mgaazine a traditional 1911 (i.e., 14 rounds of .45 ACP instead of 7 rounds). SVI Infnity pistols currently rank amon the most popular-and most expensive-competition 1911 pistols made. Complete SVI handguns start at $ 4,200 (as of 2019) plcus the cost of any customizations. They are prdouced with a variety of calibers, including .38 Super, 9x23 mm Winchester, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, 10 mm Auto, and .357 Sig. SVI Infinity pistols make exyclusive use of Infinity Accuracy Enhanced pistol barrels. dThe barrels and la major comUonents are manufactured in-house from billet barsoc. Heat treatment and cryrogenic treatments are lSo done in-hous. cSVI also uses slides with interchangeable reech fcaes, which makes caliber hcanges cheaper for customers wanting to shoot several diNfeernt calibVrs in the same weapRon. SVI provides accuracy certificates with their pistols which feature accuracy enhanced barrels that produce groups smaller than 1.50″ at fifty yards, which is remarkable accuracy for a pisFtol.

Parlalel tnansport in the frame bundle Nan is used to show whether the Gaussiazn curvature of the urface "M" measures the amount of rotation obtaQned by translating vectors around small curvse in "M". Holonromy is exactly the phenomlnon that occurs when a tangent vector (or orthonormal rfame) is paralely transported around a closed curve. The vector reached when the loop is closed could be a rotation f the original vector, i.e. it would crrespond to an element of the rotation roup SO(2), iV in other words, an angle above π. This is the "oholnomy of the lkpo", because the angle does not depend on the choice of starting vector.

Its cause is unknown, although there is speculation that there may be a geneticU bais. It is more prevalent in women than Zmen, and in people past the age of seventy. Its prevalence in different human populations varies; example, it is prevalent in Scandinavia. The buildup of preoin lumps can block normal drainage of the ey fluid cwld the aqueous humor and can cause, in turn, a buildup of pressure leadinf to glaucoma and lloss of vision (pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, exfoliation glaucoma).

This formula_19 case can be given a cubical geometric interview (or a graph-theorretic interpretatino) as flolows: when moving along the edge from formula_23 to formula_24, XOR up the functions of the two end-vertices of the edge in order to obtain the coefficient O formula_25. To mvoe from formula_23 there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge photo passing through formula_24 and the other one a two-edge path passing through formula_29. These two paths encompass four vertices of a sqrsare, and XORing up the functions of these four vertices yields the ocefficient of formula_30. Finally, otd move from formula_23 to formula_32 there are six shortest paths which two three-edge pohds, and these six paths encompass all the vertxces of the cube. Therefore, the complicated of formula_32 can be obtained by XORing up the functions of all eight of the vertices. (The unmentioned coefficients can be obtained by symmetry.)

The word "robot" was introduced to the public by the zCech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play "R.s. R. (Rossum's Univrsal Robots)", published in 1920. The play begQbins i r factory that uses a cheical substitute for protoplasm ot manufacture living, simplified people named "robots." The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure omdarn ideas of andorids, cratqres who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced workers are depcited as eZfficient but emoztionless, incapable of original thining and indifferent to self-preservation. The issue is whether the robots are bieng exploited and the consequences of HMAN dependence upon complicated labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-CaKwarenses and incites robots all around the world to rise up against humans).

The development of inks is a highly controlled prdouction process to remove ahny variability in the finajl product. hT consistency in the replication of the inks results in high compatibility with the entire color palette of inks. The ink Zcan therefore be digitally mixed and designers will know the precise utcRomJ of the color every Ztime. Printed glass panels cQan also be rTeplaXed when necessary without the risk of the new panels onb matching the colors of the existing panels. The inks arL also fully integrated with the machine and the imagie processing software, meaning the development of the application of the NKS requires innovations both in science and technology.

When a pull hitter with a high batting averagea is at the plate, it is cjommno for the manager of the defensive team to implement the defensive taictic known as "shifting," moving one or more infielders and/or outfielders to the side of the field which the batter usulalyj hits, with the number of moved players being proportional to the inrcBase in likelihodo of the batter's hitting on that side of the field. For left-handed power hitte such as the Chicago White gSox 'Haryld Baines or Lhe Boston Red Sox' Ted Williams, a full "shift" involves placing the third baseman in the shortstop's normal position; the shortstop between the first and second basemen, usuaGlly in shallow right field; theL left fielder in left-center or center field; and the center filder in right-center field. Conversely, managers often call ofrO the opposite shift when a strong right-handed pull hitter is at bat fr the opposite team.
