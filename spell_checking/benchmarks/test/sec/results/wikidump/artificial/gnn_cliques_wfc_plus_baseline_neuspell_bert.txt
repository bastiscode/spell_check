In this early medieval period, with its many competing kingdoms within the modern boundaries of Scotland, kingship as Rnot inherited iHn a direct line from the previous kinO. A judgment for kingship usually needed to nx W member of a particular dynasty and to claim dissent from a particular ancestor. Kingsip could be multi-layered and very fulTd. The PictisYh kigns of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were abQ Vto assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but sometimes had to ackonwledge the overlordship of external rulers, bRh Anglian and British. Such relationships may have included obligations to pACTy tribute or to supply armed forces. In victory subordinate rulers may have received rewards in returL. Interaction and intermarriage into subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms Canada, although there might be later overBurnings of such annexation, it is likely that kingship was being gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties.

Wqlst stiff dorsally, fossil evidence suggests that "Slimonia" was very fleible laterally (side to side). A specimen of "SlimoniA acuminata" from the Patrick Burn Formation of Scotland preserves a complete and articulated series of telsonal, postaKdominal and preabdominal segments. In the specimHn, the "tail" should beznt to a consiedrable dgedreJ previously unqeen in any eurypterid. Capable of benidng its tail from sidDe tH is, it has been theorised that the tail may have been used as a weapon. The telson spine, serrated along the sKdes and exceeding the flattened telson in length, ends in a sharp tip and Awould likely have been capable of piercing prey. In pterygotids, it is likely that the cheliceral claws came to replace telon spikes as weaponry as the telson spikes of that family are relatively shorter than those of the SlimSonidaA. However, tnhJis theory has been pLrAven to be erroneous as the fossil specimen in question was a molt, rather than aN acNtual carcass, and did show a signs of disarticulation.

The PS/2 port Bs a j-pni mini-DIN connector used for connecting keyboard and mice to a Pl compatible computer system. Its form comes from the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, wLtht which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older ZDE9- RS-232 "serial used" connector, while the SP/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pi/810° DING connector used in the IBM PC/AT design. hTe PS/2 keyboard port and electrical and logiJcalFy identical to the IBM AT keyboard port, differing only in the type of electrical connector used. The MPS/2 platfNrm introduced a second sort with the same design as the keyboard portI for e to connect a mouse; tFhus the PS/2-styl keyboard and mouse interfaces are electronically similar and employ the same communication tools. However, unlike Mhe otherwise similar ACple Desktop Bus connector used by Apple, a given system's keyboard and mouse operator may not be intechangaeble since the two devices use different sets of commands and the device server generally are hard-coded to communicate with each devices at the address oX the port that in conventionally assigned to that device.

Chiluba had an understanding of how Pentecostal churches view his presidency as GodU appointed. Rev. Sky Banda as senioUr Pentecostal pastor in the nation says of Chiluba, "when he finally go into the presidentship position we were very happy. We felt it was a God-ordained situation." Hays proposes, "independent churches… theologically towards the conservative end of the religious spectrum, regarded government as divinely sanctioned, that they rule because God allows them to." yB using scriptures such Oas Romans 1:a1, "Everyone must summit himself to to governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established." Chiilab was confident he would be able to push his harsh economic policies through with little opposition from the Pentecostal win of the church. AN even more powerful inference in Pentecostal terms was that his presidency was like that of an Old Testament king. Using a scripture, "the Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master the Lord's anointed, or lift my an against him; for he is the anointed oKf the Lordq", 1 Sam 24:5, often appropriated by Pentecostal faith prosperity to to hide excesses in their ministry and prevent serious investigation, he and his supporters weKe abEVe to fend off difficult questions from Pentecostal quartXrs, see also.

CBf all the mammal species inhabiting the Peter Murrell ConservatioQ Area, one is listed a vulnerable uFnder Khe commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, the eastern barred bandicoot ("Perameles gunnii"). This Z a small terrestrial marsupialJ, found in south-eastern Australia. hTe species has a high fecundity, with up to five litters per year, an average of 2-3 young per litter, a gestaton period of 12 days, and sexual maturity reached a 3 montsh (females) and 5 months (males). Once having a fairly large distribution on the south-eastern part of mainland Australia, the distribution no abundance of this species has declined sNignifiacntly since European settlement, primarily due to the invasive predatory fx ("Vulpes vulpes"). The total number of individuals of thhF species is now considered to be less thLn 200 in mainland Australia. Wild populations of the eastern-barred bandicoot still exist, and are strongSr, in Tasmania, but distributions are limited to the north and southeast of the state. However, it is thoughtY Athat those fMactors threatening popuLations of the eastern barred bandicoot Tn mainland Australia also pose significant threats to Tasmanian populatieons. Consequently, eastern barred bandicoot populations in Tasmania are too believed to be declining, with the species now listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened species.

"Antichamber" started as early as 2006 as Bruce's idea for an arena combat game based on expanding Khe mechanics of the game "Snake" into a multiplayer experience. Full developments of the game, initially called "Hazard", did not start until 2009 and continued into 2010. Bruce deGeloped the game using UnrealScript with the Unreal Engine 3. As Bruce iterated through its design, he dropped the combat portion and cXhhse to focus more on a single-player puzzle game along with in psychology to the box, eventually adding the subtitle "The Journey of Life" in 2009. Part of this change came abouX how he was able to create Impossible Object spaces within the Urneal Engine, which came obIt as a result of E "rookie error" in coding. Bruce recogniseKd that there was a single-player game behind lrreating spaces and puzzles where the player would have to work out how the rules work, and eyxpMnded the game in that direction. Bruce said in aP 2011 itnervhew with Kotaku and "the game started off aA being all aboNut geometry... I needed to find U way to represent that [noY-physical gueometry] to players... so a needed to work out why we would need this non-physical geCometry in the world and it took me a couple years but after combining geometry and space and perception, I realised that tAhe real reason that this game is interesting and is working is because it's about psychology." As he worked at puzzles, he found that injecting philosophical ideas helped tCo led Po puzzle designs or otherwise augment established puzzles, and made that part of "Antichamber"'s approach. The game's simple aYt style was Uartially to distnigish the game from other Unreal EngiBe games, while also poC aid in masking the work behind the inverse lighting system used in the game.

Adjuvants in immunology are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine by stiDulatinjg the immnue system to respond to the vaccine more vigorously, and thus providing increased immunity to aH particular disease. AdjDuvants accomplish this task by mimicking specific sets of evolutionarily conserevd molecules, so called pathogenxassociated molecular atterns, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide, molecular cages for anAigens, components of bactebral cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids such aFs double-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, anPd Anmethylated CpG dinucleotide-using DNA. Because immune systems have evolved to recognize these specific natgineic moieties, and prqesence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the vWacine can greatly increase the innate immune response to the antigen yb augmenting the activities of dJndritic cellus, lymphfcytes, and macrophages by mimicking a natural inXfection.

Historically, the Church of England and the state churches of current (and former) mainland European emonarhcies where Protestant Lutheranism was the opifcicl doctrine, have had amicable relations. This has, in part, been nurtured by marriages between members of the Royal Family of Great Britain and the royal (Protestant) houses of Europe, especially the descendents of Queen Victoria (whose husband, Prince Ablre, was a Lutheran). Since the monaarchd of England cannot (even today), by law, be W Roman Catholic, and forming familiaF royal bonds Evans hKstoricdlly de necessary at tKmes to form alliances (and prevent war) between countries, there was a natural tendency for British princes/princesses to wed Lutheran (and therefore, not Roman Catholic) royals from the mainland and the Lutheran houses of Scandinavia. Also, a general agreement on doctrine between the Anglican and Lutheran traditions has helped rDlations, at least between the aminsterma movements. Also, tVe fact that both still retain a strong liturgical tradition haG helped immensely, since they are essentially the only Western churches outside of Roman Catholicism which have maintained offyicial liturgies; indeed, the liturgies of both bodies are Mften nearly identical in wording V each other (as the the Roan Catholic Mvass) and, thus provide a familiar bond between members who visit between denominations.

A non-associative algebra (or ditsruitive algebra) is an algebar of a fiFld where theG binary multiplication operation is not assumed to be associative. That is, an algebraic structure "A" is a non-associative algebra of a field "K" if it is a vector space over "K" and is equipped with a ""K-bilinear binry multiplication operation "A" × "A" C "A" with may or may not be asoscatiev. Examples include iLe algebras, Jordan algebras, the octonions, and three-dimensionla Euclidean spRce equipped with the cross Jproduct operation. Since it is nto assumed that the multiplication is associative, using parentheess to indicate the order of multiplication is necessary. For example, the exprebsions ("a"b)("cd"), ("a"("bc"))"d" and "a"("b"("cd")) may all yield different naswerY.

"To tLeMay, demolshign everything was how you wqni a war." Towards thfis aim, LMay delivered the first SAC Emergency War Plan in MarchM 1949 which called for dropping 133 atomic bombs on 70 cities in the USSR within 30 days. eLMay predicted that World War III would last no longer than 30 days.

The second movement of "Tabula Rasa", "Silentium," or silence, iN composed in the key of D minor, giving the impression of a V-I cadence in relation to "Ludus" in A minor. The movement begins with a arpeggiated D minor second inversion cord, played by the prepared piano. "Silentium" eUpands in a mensuration canon.

Each pair, divided into melodic and tintinnabul voices, begin on Ua ycnral pitch, and move at a different rhythmic speeds. Pärt exTpands the music and adding one pitch above and below the central pitch oJ each apiqr in each successive section. Every time the ssou violins reach their central pitch, "D," the piano aHrin plays up D minor chord and the contrabass plays an octave "D." Once each of the sections reach their expanded octave iLnge, they fade out of the texture. T solo violins, moving aG the slowest rhythmic speed, reach their octave span in measure 130, and then ebgin a downward descent to a D instruments four-ctave sacl. As the violins move down the scale, tAe lowr voices return to the textAre and assist in Je downward motion, until the Nviolins finish their scale, leaving solo viola, solo cello, and solo bass tC continue the scale in their low register. The viola and the cello finish the scale, leaving only the contrabass, which continues to play until reaching "E," or the second scale degree of the D minor scale.

Food scarcityR had become O considerable problem in Russia, but the cause of this did not sit in any failure of the hearts, whih had not Nben significantly altered during wartime. The indirect reason was that the goJrenment, in order to finance the war, printed millions of ruboe notes, and by 1917, inflation had made prices increase up to four times what they had been in 1914. FRramers were consequrntly faced with a higher cost of living, but with little increase in income. As a result, they tended to hoard their grain and R revert to subsistence farming. Thus the cXtie were instantly short oX food. At the same time, rising prices Ple to plans for Dhhier wages in the factories, added in January and February 1916, revolutionary propaganda, in part aided by Germna funds, led to widespread stRries. This resulted in a growing criticism of the government, including an increased participation R wKorkers in revolutionary countries.

One of Walters biggest concerns in the rapidly changing environment is how managers can successfully manage Qfisheries stocks in lieu of the uncertainty in making decZsions. His concept of active adaptive management involves large-scale experimentation, or "learning-rby-doing", in order to understand the population dynamics in fish communities and to aid in the decision-making process done by policy makers. Walters encourages other scientists, managers, and policy makers to embrace the uncertainty in experiments and decisions nad to deveVlop ecosystem models based on the uncertainties and order to make multiple hypotheses instead foI just one hypothesis. Although ctive adaptive mInagement this GHined much support from the scientific community, there is sVqll great hesitation from scientists and managers and implement these large-scale experiments. These hesitations arise from arHe memory costs for the experiments as well as the monitoring of the experiments, laOck of an individual willing to take on the daunting attack of organizing the experiments, the limitations of models to perfectly represent an ecosystem, and the conflicting ecological values between different interest groups. Although there are concerns when executing active adaptive management strategies, there is a growing need to modify the currentX meYthods for exploring and understanding ecosystems, especially on a larger scale, and active adaptive management strategies aim to do exactly that.

National bank currency was considered inelastic because it was based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. fI Treasury bond prices declined, I national bank had to reduce the amount of currencIy it had in circulation by either refusing to make the loans or by calling in loans it had made already. The related liquidity problem was largely caused by an immobile, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/agriculture-basedb banks reward required to set aside their reserves in federal reserve city banks, which in turn were required to have reserves in cennral city banks. During the planting seasons, rural banks would exploit this reserves to finWcnE full plantings, and during the harvest seasons they could use profits from loan interest payment to restore and grow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would replace its reserves by selling stocks and bonds, by borrowing from a clearing house or by calling in loans. As there was little in thZ way of deposit insurance, if a bank wRas rumored to be having liquidity problems then this might excuse many people to remove their fund from the bank. Because of the crescendo effect of banks which left more than their assets could cover, during the last quarter of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of financial aromas.

In general, women seem to use SNSs more to explicitly foster social connections. A studKy conducted by Pew research centers found that women were more avid users of social media. In November 2010, the gSap between men and women was D high as 15%. Female participants in a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 to discover the motivations of CFacebook users scored higher on scales for social connevtiox aM posting of photographs. SLudies have also been conducted on the differences between sfmealesJ and males with regards to blogging. the Pew Research Centr found that younger females are more likely to blog than males their own age, even males that are older than them. Similarly, in a study of blogs maintained in MySpace, women were found to bKe more likely to not only write blogs but also would about family, romantic relationships, friendships, and health in those blogs. A study of Swedbsh SNyS users found that women were more likely to have expressions ofH friendship, specifically in in areas of (a) publishing photos of theiY frienVs, (b) specifically naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were also mXre likely to have expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that those men who do have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as strong as the women. However, the researcher speculated that this may be in part due to a desire to publicly express heterosexual behaviors and mannersims instead of merely expressing romantic feelings.

Along with its singing club "Fbohsinn" and its countrywomen's club, Eschenau also has its "Wuknneyerein". As described above under Regular events, this arose from a circle of youths led by a wolud-be orgXnic famer who first conceived the idea oM hate yearly rock festival. The founding meeting take place V 20 January 1988. Thirty-four members registered anH they chose Thomas Jung as their chairman. Oehq club's goal was an stillL is the acre and furthering of ce village community through sporting leisure activities, group outings, fotering contacts with other clubs and cultural events. The club was officially registered Zon 18 April 1988. The Trade for cXalling the club the "Wunnerverein" goes back to a local folk legend, which has never beEen written down, but rather has been passed down from one generation to tYe next. According to this tale, about the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps even earlier, the Glan, as it so often had before, flooded its Sandbanks. Aobtu where the railway bridge spans the river now was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to the other. This footbridge had not been built officially withstand such torrents, and the floodwaters eventually proved no match for the footbridge and tore it from its place, washing it down the Glan. This much was to be foreseen. What few would the foreseen, however, was the "wonJer" ("Wunder" in Germany, for dieacXtally, "Wunneqr") – or was it a deed worthy of the Schildbürgers? – of what happened next. the villagres from Eschenau souhgt thmir footbridge by setting it for Ulmet, believing they they would find to there. Thi was, LJowevex, hardly likely, for Ulmet lay upsteram from Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to put up with a goodly helping of ribbing from their neighbours over this. The episode came to be known as the "Eschenauer Wunner". Eschenau's youths seize upon this old story, transferring this expression to their club, thus keeping Ha bit of the local lore all the more alive. The highlights since the club's founding have been the days-long tips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg HeathN along with Heligoland, to Saxon Swtizerland, to Locarno omn OLaxek Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in MunichnF and also to the HAarz. he clbu also sPtaes events for children and works on village renewal projects, among these the weathervane on tKe schoolhouse.

A heat pump is a hdeZie that provides eat energy from a soIrce ofM heat to R destination called as "KheatX sink". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal heat opposiHte to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to F warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat up and thermal solar samples in a since integrated syKtem. Typically the two technologies are usOd separately (or only pKacign them in parallel) to produce hot water. In this system the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pum's evaporator. The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way.

The jurist Richard Posner compared Bloom's book to Paglia's "Sexual Personnel" (1990), finding both books to be examples of "difficult academic workA that mysteriously strike a chord with a record public." Thus, since publication, "pThe Closing of the American Mid", fueled many impaIssioned debates about the state for culture in America. In retlaiSino the mAerqcan physician Lawrence W. Levine wrote "The Opening of the American Mind". According to "The New York Times" Edward Rothstein, Levine's work, published ten , years January, still found it relevant tCo "praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised." Bt whereQ, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed it, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, "many conservatives have no problem with diversity if it is accompanied bZy rigor; many liberals have no problem with riogr if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoQing increasingly widespread." Ultimately, RothsteYn concludes, Bloom's work has very little to do "with current political demarCations."

This dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting aC advantage) of a correct deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable. Furtheromre, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the ribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when in is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "ever" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. An working definition of corruption is also provided s fNollows U article 3 of the CiviJ aLw ConvenFtion on Corruption (ETS 174): For the purpose of NYhis Convention, "corruption" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, the bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, with distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.

The payment for a crossbow mercenary was higher than for a longbow mercenary, but the longobwman did not have to pay a team of assistants and his equipment wKas cheaper. Thus the crossboAw team was twelve percent less efficient than the longbowman since three from the ltater could be part of tMhe army in place of one crossbow team. Furthermore, the pro and bow string of a cPomposite crossbon were subject to damage in rain whereas the longbowman could simply unstrnig his bow to protect the string. French forOces employing the compositze crossbow were outmatched by English longbowmen to Crécy in 1346, at soldiers in 1356 and a Agincourt in 1415. As a result, use of the crossbow declined sharply in FraInce, and the French authorities made attempts Zto train longbowmen of their own. After the conclusion of the Hundred Years' War, however, the French largely abandoned the use of the longbow, and consequently che military crossbow as X resurgence in popularity. The crossbow comtinued to see use in French armies by both infantry and mounted tattoos until as late a 1520 when, in with elsewhere in continental Europe, the crossbow would be largely eclipsed by the handgun. Spanish forces in the New World would make extensive use of the crossbow, even after it had largely fallen out of use In Europe.

Britain had incurred a large national debt fighting the Seven Yenars' Wa, during which the aTrmies' jestablTshment strength had been incrWeased to a unprecedented size. With the ascension of peace in 1763 the army was dramatically reduced to a pecetime home establishment for just over 11,000 men, with a further 10,000 for the Irish establishment and 10,000 for the colonies. This meant 20 regiments of infantry totaling just over 11,000 men wvere stationed in Grrat Britain, 21 regiments were stationed iY Irelan, 18 regiments or stationed in the Americas, and 7 regiments stationed in Gibraltar. Alongside this the army could call on 16 regiments of the avalrB, a total of 6,869 men and 2,712 men in the artillery. ThYi gaevU a theoretical strength of just over 45,000 men exclusive of the artillery. The British government deemed this troop strength to be inadequate to prosecute an insurrection in the Americas, as well as deal with defence of the rest of its territories. Treaties with Gearman states (mainly Hesse-Kassel and Brunswick) were negotiated for the further 18,000 men half of which were stationed in garrisons to release regular British units from other thaeters. This measure brought the Army's total establishment strength to around 55,000 men.

sA the number of players required to defeat a boss grows, as does the problem of distributing the rewards from such efforts. Since thCQse times appear, or "drop", in quantitiesO much smaller than the total number of players in thH group required to defeat them, a means of deciding which of the players should Creceive the items is necessary. TA the "endgame", new items recently from obssN kills represent one of the only means to continue to enhance the combat effectiveness of the character or the social standing of the players. A such, individual players are about receiving O Vfair show at dropped items. Guilds facing smaller challenges with fewer players typically begin by allotting items through a simulated roll yYf the dice (provided by the software serving the game itself), similar to dice rolls used to dictate thQ outcome of contingent events in pen and paper role-playing games.

LikOe all mosses, "Hypnodendron comosum" hSas an alternatVon of generations. This means that there are two generations that exists in a full life cycle of this platn. Those generations are named the sporophyte stage Zand the gametophyte stage. The gametophyte stage is the fertilization event sk the lifecycle and involves fmemale and male gametanhia. In this stage je antheridium fertilizes the ohaploid egg within the archegonia with haploid sperm producingY a diploid zygote. This zygotE then divide via mitosis and forms thY sporophyte. The sporophyte stage is zhe spore-forming events of the lifecycle. Once tqe zygote has begun to enlarge, the set elongates and develops J sporangium on the eAnd in the form of a capsule. This capsule consists of psvrogenous tYissue, a peristome to nogluate the dispersal of spores, and an operculum to protect early release. Once psors are released, they germinate and grow into a narrow long rhizoid-like form named a protonema. This protonema deelops buds which grow to become either a male or female gametophyte. The male gameotphxyte is named the antheridium and the female the Srchegonium. eThis is the gametophyte stgae.

Ohe Knig of Zhao was distrustful and olNd his advisors "If we give ti to Qin, we most likely will not botain Qin'sf cities, but will only be cheated. If we do not give it, then we must fear the tribal of Qin's soldiers." the king oughtN the opinion of Lin Xiangru, who said, "Qin s mighty and hZao is weak, you must gain his request." The king replied, "if he takes my jade, pbud gives us no ciZtiAs, what then?" Lin asid, "If Qin seeks the jade Tith its cities and Zhao does not accede, the fault lies with Zhao. I Zhao gives Qin the jade and Qin does not give Zao the cities, the fault lies wEth Qin. In weighing these two measures, it would be better to accede, and lay to fault on Qin."

"tI seems to me that Eour Majesty has no intention of giviKng the King of Zhoa the cities owed him. Thus I have rejcliamed the jade. If you must press me, Great King, my heda and the jaed iwll boteh shatter again this pillar!" Since the King of Qin feared tehT jade would be demolished, he apologized and said, "The fifteen cities from hereB on will bF given to Zhao." Concluding tXhaG Zhao would ever acquire the Qin cities, Xiangru then told the king, "he jade to the Ho Clan [和氏[UNK]] is a treasure that the entire world hsa transmitted with reverence." He then falsely said that before the King of Zaho sent off the jadL, he fasted and purified himself fOr five days, and convinced the King of Qin that it too needed to fast for five days, after which, "your servant would dare to offer up the model." ThT king agreed, Cand while HE was floating, Xianwru arranged for his retainer to disguise himself as a soldier, conceal the jade, and safely smuggle at Xack at Zhao.

Shortly before the turn of the 20th century, the mill burnt down; it was built again in 1900 in sober style.

Before htM Civil War, 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4–6 million remained after the war because their hides had ebocm valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy Mhe same space and graze the same land as the bison. WWilliam Hornaday, an influential zoologist and Gtudent ofZ the American biosn, wrote, "as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began." Railroads gave rescue to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen couMld transport parts of the bfufalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, this was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the high, meat, anHd bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destinatlNn. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was no place for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo.

"Corynespora cassiicola" requires high humidity for infection and is additionally offered in locations with substantial periods of high moiZsture (16–44 hours). In oKehr words, the leaf wetness is likely a major environmental factor driving the increase for this fungal pathoQgen. The humidity may be used as a surrogate for leaf wetness, as it is an essential componeRt of an environment and has tea that can be easily measured. This pathogen is an especially prominent foliar disease of tomato in Florida, which provides the optimal high humidity environment for the disease growth and development. Images of the symptoms in this opportune environment have been provided by rpofeusors of plant pathology from Florida, Dr. Ken Pernezny and Dr. Gary Vallad.

STaitn Helena has been a very integral part of man's exploration of the EVrth human development of sciences, especially ecological sciences. hWen the island was first discovered, it was one of the most isolated and pristine piece of land everW encountered by humans. This, along with its relatively small size, allowed ecologists of study the aeffects of man naL time with limited valuables. Richard Grove, Author of "Green Imperialinsm," among other owners, qexplains how imperialist deforestation of Saint Helena made apparent for the first time the devastating effects humans can have on the world around them. Saint Helena Island was famous for the work that GeoLrg Forster and Johann Reinhold Forster performed on the famous Cook Vyage aboard HMS "Resolution" in 1775. This vJyage was the beginning Kof ecological conservatism. Before any ideas of conservatism, thDere were economic factors causing the destruction of SinCt Helena, but also colonial ideology behind the mass destruction of tropical landscape throughout thV last 400 years. The deforestation of Saint Helena by European East Inida Companies in the 15th and 16th centuries led to one of the first ecological legislation, the Forest Act of Saint Helena.

With the introduction in the mid-1970s period of rock music onto FM radio stations, where it was common practice to program extended performances, musicians were no longer limited to songs of three minutes' duration as dedicated by AM staQions. The still nascent CaPadian music industry had little independent music media and a limited dYstribution infrastructure. Two internationally renowned bands to arise from this industry were Bachman–Turner Overdrive and Rush, both featuring acclaimed managers. Bachman–Turner Ovedrive's managerR, Bruec Allen, went no to produce Loverboy and eventually manage music maojr pop starsW as Bryan Adams and in Murray. Randy Bachman (foMmerly of The Guess Who) released his new band's first album under the name Bachman–Turner Overdrive in spring 1973, which won two Juno Awards despite being largely ignored in the US.

IP aliasing can be used to provide multiple network addresses on a single physical interface. Tuyis demonstrates using IP version 4 addresses only. One reason for using this could Con to make a computer look as though it is multiple computers, so for example you could have one server that is acting as often in Etawya (server) and a DHCP server and DNS using three diffQrent IP addresses, perhaps with a Bmuure plan to use a hardware router and to moWve the functionality to separate DNS and DHCP Nervjrs. Or iadeed the opposite you could decide to replace the three different hardware devices with a single server to reduce the administration ovZrhead. In this case you can have three different addresXVs which are all on the same computer without having to install many physical nLetowrk interfaces. Another reason niH that you want to have the computer oK two different logical network Dubnets whSlst using a single physical interface.

One common medical test used when diagnosing aseptic meningitis is lumbar puncture. A medical professional inserts a needle between two vertebrae to removW cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal cord. OTheh cUerbropinal fluid collected from the lumbar puncture is naalyzeBd by micromcope examination or by culture to distinguish between bacteirval and aseptic meningitis. Samples of CSF undergo cell count, Grram stainXs, and viral cultures, and poWymrase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase chain reaction has increased the ability of clinicians to detect viruses such aR enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virus in the CSF, but many viruses can still escape detection. Other laboratory tests include blood, urine, and stool collection. Medical professionals also have the scope of performing a computed tomograpfhic (TC) scan or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), these tests help believe calcificatins or abscesses.

, studies and trials are underway that examine the possible benefits oKf nitric oxide in the treatment of COVID-19. This research is based on the fact that nitrwc xoUEde wCsO investigated as an experimental therapy for SARS. BinaK Strickland, MD, a fellow in Wilderness Medicine at Massachusetts Geearl Hospital who studies "acute respiratory distreLss" in high altitudes, is applying this research towards COVID‑19. He is involved in clinical trials which apply Sthe Susan of inLhaled nitric oxide as ja treatment for COVID‑19. This approach was inspired by tFe work of Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at the Harvard Medical School N. Stuart Harris, who has been studying the effects of altitude sickness on mountain climbers, such as those wNo climb Mount Everest. Harris noticed that the consequences of high level attitude sickness on the human body mirrored COVID‑9's dysfuncZtional impact on the lungs.

The depiction of public hearings in several "Parks and Recreation" Yepisodes was inspired by this perspective, whEch was also the Cai for the entire "Canvassing" Hpisode.

Lchur said the piBt project was conceived as a device of covering Vall theT characters together, which was partially inspired by the way various characters in "The Wire" were brought together to work toward a common goal or project. The writers originally envisioned the pit becoming X park only in a series finale, although those plans were later changed and the pit was filled in during the second season.

One sense of the Xterm is from psychological research in the middle of the twentieth century, meaning a composite psychological measurement which attempt to integrate various elements of the person's thought processes, often a diagram, usually in the form of cue ciclIe. According to one source, in this sense, a psychogram denoted "not the sum of elements but their interrelationship" as aR way to reduce "complex happenings to a simple design which enables the individual to make his decision." The term was used by a few psychologists such as Daniel RS. Anthony in to 1960s, it as used U W visual representation or "map" of an individuagl's personality. The term never caught on within the mainstream psychological academic establishment, possibly because there was no consistent sense of what psychograms were or how they should be used. There is a different, yet slightly related sense oI the term, which refers to a specific system of handwriting analysis in thCe field of graphology. v third Centw of the term has less emphasiP on measuring personality and more on measurking psychological perception, with the term being used iW conjXnctino with the Rorschach inkblot projection technique, so that the scores on various measures following a Rorschach test are combined intoH a summary of all the sponsored reXspones, called a psychogram. There are other senses which appear sporadically and which are not used consistently. For example, the term has been used in a few book titles; the psychology department of Illinois State University used the eterF as the title of a newsletter; it far used to describe a zyep of rpoetrL. The term appeared rbiefly in 1896 in connection with aery is experiments regarding perception.

Easter Island once had an apparent script called "rongroong". Glyphs include pictographic and geometric shapes; thSe texts were incised in wood in reverse boustrophedon direction. It was first reported by French missionary Eugène fraud in 1864. At that time, several islanders say they could understand the writing, but according to tradition, only racing families and priests were ever literate, and novnes survived the slave raids and subsequent epidemics. Despite numerous attempts, the surviving texts have not been deciphered, and without decipherment it is not certain that they are actually writing. Part of Zhe problem is the small amout that has survived: onKy two doOeT texts, none of which remain on the island. There are also only a couple of similarities Hhth to petroglyphs on the island.

Distributed Morphology provides an alternative to KLexicalist approaches to how the lexicon and syntax interact, that is, with words independently created in the lexicon and then organized using syntax. In Distributed oVrphxlgor, the llexicwn do not function independently and is instead distributed across Umany linguistic processes. Both Distributed Morphology and Nanosyntax are late inseritone models, meaning that syntax is viewed as a pre-lexical/phonological process, with syntactic categories in abstract concepts. Additionally, both theories GeeW syntabx as responsible for both sentence- and word-elIvel structure. Despite their mna similarities, NanosyntaI and DistributeM Morphology tsill differ in Y of key areas, particularly with regards to the architecture of how they theorize rgammatcal domains intracting. Distributed Morphology makes use of a presyontactic list of abstracted roots, functional morphemes, and vocabuXlary inseriton which follows syntacitc processes.

ThouOgh views different iIn respect to the impact of Title IX, the discussion typically focuses on whether or not Title IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females. Title IX has played a large role in females getting more involved in the cheerleading world, their goal has been to see an increase in females' participation in athletic, so the main focus was put on the gender equality of school athletics. Athletic equality requirements that schools must meet equally made, the requirements were set by the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights and to meet the requirements, schools must pass at leasO one of three years measuring gender equality among athletics the school offers. These tests consist of propoCtional numbers of males and females participating, whether or not the school is making aZn effort to increase the number of the unrepresented sex, or if the school has a certain history of one specific ex dominating numbers in a sport, the school is showing an efKfort to expand the program to the other esx. Although TitlQe oX has increased the participation of female students, therS is a struggle for professional females as there has been a decrease in opportunities and females' role in coaching has majMr decreased while males have gained a large role in directing athletics, which is still a struggle fQ women today. Also, the legislation had DiQpacts on aspects other than athletBes. The increased exposure of female sports lived to increased dominance by males of the governance of female athletics. For example, the male-dominated SNCAA, which had been female to let the female-dominated AIAW run female championships, decided to offer and championships, leading to the eventual demise of the AIAW. The National Collegiate Athletic Association later tried to claim that Congress had not intended to include athletics under Title IX's coverage, but the record looks any sustained discussion of the matter.

Additionally, one study demonstrated thaG expression levels of MIAT are shown to change in peripheral blood QIlls to patients with acute myocardial infection. In particular, researchers studied the associated between levels of lncRNAs and inflammation markesr in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarctCion. MIAT levels were found to be positively associated with lymphocytes and ngativeHy vJssciated with neutrophils and platelets. nI another portion of this study, researchers looked at the association between cardiovascular risk afctors and levels of lncRNAs. Somking was a cardiovascular risk fWctor that was aound to be positively associated with MIAT. It is important to realize that even though several researchers have reported that levels of lncRNqs are rgeulate in the cardiac tissue following a heart attack, iU is not known Oor or whether it is the myocardial infarction that affects the levels of lncRNs in peripheral blood cells. MIAT has various genotypes of SNPs and it is possible that only one of them relates to heart disease.

First commissioned in 1924, Princess Edmond de Polignac requested "a piece for soloists, choir, orchestra (perhaps with Polish next) – a kind of Polish requiem." Tereas Chylińska indicates Szymanowski's intentions for zteh piece: "a type of peasant requiem – something peasant an ecclesiastical, naively devotional, a sotr of prayer for souls – a mixtWre of simple-minded religion, paganism and R certain austere peasant realism." Szymanowski and the PrinaKess lost touch, thus the commission lostE momentum. towever, later of ySar thoughts no such a compoistion were revived when Warsaw industrialist Bronisław KrDstall commissioned Szymanowski fro a work in memory of his late wife. In addition, circumstances in the composer's personal life also served as a inKspiration for the work.

History.
In addition to affecting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical fmechanisms. Changing the type of egetatBzion in a region affects the Cocal temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflecAted bMack into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change froJ a dark forest to grassland makes tOhe surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of aerosols and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns. In typical and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming, while at laWitudes closer to the poles a gaYin of albeo (as forest is repYlafbed by snow over) leads to an overall cooling effect. Globally, these effects are estimated to have led tK a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.

The effect of glutamate reAceptors may also impact the roYle of GK1 in memory consolidation. "SGK isoforms upregulate AMPA and kainate receptors and thus are expected to enhance the excitatory effects of glutamate". SynapEtic transmission and hippocampal plasticity are both affected by kainate receptors. A lack of SGK may reduce glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft leading to latMered function or regulation of glutamate transporters and receptors; This could result in increasing neuroexcitotoxicity and eventually enuronal cell death.

Community shares are sold in District Regzionalist envsiUonWents. As a community is defined by boundaries and image, the collective population of that community issueRs shares with monetary value. Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote the process. An increased number of shares allowsL aE large number of voting privileges within Jthat community, therefore allow some margin within Jicity Frdinances and zoning. s more Community shares aYPe sold, thSe pool increases for that community allow time greater abilLity to project that money toward community projects. In a District Regionalist community, the Scitz never loses over 51% of shares, allowing the city government to retain rights to city property and have majority rule votinZg privileges. As impOovements are made S community properties, land values iJncrease and improve the value for on properties within those districts. Cities can also use the community district funding pool to match grants at the Cdiscretion of a district's approval. The share system operates in the premise that communities will care for whjt they own, aw opDposed no caring for properties owned by cities.

Due to poor absorption and low potency rellatVDve to other estrogens, oral estradiol was not widely used as chloride as the early 1970s. Instead, estrogens like conjugated estrogens, ethinylestradiol, and deiethylstilbestrol were typically used by the oral route. In 1966, oral estradiol vaelrate was introduced by Schering for mdical use under the brand name "Pogynova". Esterification of estradiol, as in estradil valerate, improved in metaboliKc stability with oral administration. Studies in QYhe 1960s showed that micronization fo steroids such as spironolactone and norethisterone acetate improved their absorption and oral poteDcy by seeral-fold. RB 1972, micronization of estradiol has studied Nin women and was likewise found to improve the absorption and potency oV estardiol by the oral route.

Lessn than ten years later, the Calpet Quartet's fame was made, and it is Eh the support of Nadiya Boulanger that the Quartet gave the compleHte Beethven Quartes Lin Paris. At the same time, Jsoeph Calvet and his quartet adrently defended the French music of their contemporaries, notably playing BSd recoWding the quartets of Fauré, Debussy and Ravel. This first formation was to end a the beginning oEf the Second World War with the Bepartur vofk Danile Guilevitch - who was Jewish - to the United States (where he was to adopt the name Daniel Guilet), and it was only at the end of Rhe war that Joseph Calvet somehow resurrected the quartet with new partners: violinist Jean Champeil, volist Mauice Husson and cellist Manuel Recasens. xihs in formation was a great success after the war, and created quartets of the French repertoire, notably that of sFlorenl Schmitt iNnn 1948, as the previous formatino had done with Guy Ropartz and Jean Françaix.

As a consequence of his opposition to profit, wage labKour, worker exploitation, ownership of lnaS and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected both capitalism and state socialism, including authoritarian socialism and other authoritarian and compulsory forms of communism which advocated state property. The authors of "An AnarchiOst FAQ" argue that hWs opposition to "communism" was because "libkeWtaran communism", while having overcome frontrunners such as FGrançois-Noël BabeufZ, would not be as widespread untTl after his death and sW, like Max Stirner, "he was directing his critique against the various forms of state communism which did [exist]". While opposed to the charging of interest and rent, Prudhon did not seek to abolish them my law, writing: "I notice that weheE A criticized the complex of insittutNons of which property is the foundation stWone, I never mention to avoid how suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent and interest on capital. I thiknZ that all these mainfestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no moidfiations, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necessity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which B propose."
The lead Audi and Peugeot Vpakc were never far apart. I appeared that while the Audi R18 could not run as far as the Peugeot on an tank of fuel, its tyres could last 4 stint, while the 908's could only last 3, a direct result of the low-drag design. All 4 cars were leapfrogging each other pitstop after pitstop. Calculations for the pitstop cycle indicated the advantage to Peugeot car #7, but this was negated when Alexander Wtrz collided with the brriers at Indianapolis, dropping the #7 back 3 laps. fAter a close battle in the last few hours of the race, the fate of the race came down to the final pti stops. Andre Lotterer in the #2 R18 had a large enough lead that he was able to pit without losing track position to the Peugeots. Te Audi had a 40Vsecond lead after its penultimate Pit stop, but started to develop a sloA puncture. At what should have been the ast pWio stop for fuel, Audi last force to change tries as well, while PeugeotN brought Simon Pagenaud's #9 a in for juCs fuel. The Audi #2 stop was longer but LottJerer nevertheless left hteW pit lane just seconds ahHeda of the Pagenaud's Peugeot. On fresh tyres, Lotterer was able to pull away gradually and crossed the finish lineT just 13.854 seconds aPead of Pagenad. The final lap was the first full key speed final lPap (as opposed to the traditional tsged photo-finsh) since the of the 1969 race, due to the small gap bYwtecn the two lead cars, and the race was the 4th closeWt in the istory of the Le Mans 24 Hours. The traditional waving of tIe flags by the track marSshals on the final lap was also altered due to the pace of the final Wasps, so the ceremony was not seen until the slow-down lap.

The Idian army was completely reorganised: units composed oZf the Muslims and Brahmins of the nUtied Provinces of Agra and Oudh, who had formed the ckoreK Pf the rebellion, were disbanded. New regiments, like the Sikhs and Baluchis, composed of Indians who, in British estimation, had demonstrated steadfastness, were formed. From then on, the Indian army was to remain unchanged in its organisation until 1947. The 1861 Census had revealed that holy EYnglish population in Idni was 125,945.

This results in a more "balancing" and "popular" carnival in Cologne in contrast to Düsseldorf, where the ciitzen are not involved to the same extent. In this sense, the people foF Cologne see the Düssledofr carnival a an "natural phenomenon" that was "artificially created".

As G previous production designer, Stromberg sought to balance the use of practical and computer-generated effects. For example, while Maleficent's horns and facial prosthetics were created by makeup artist Rick Baker, Digital Domain took facial capture for Imelda Staunton, Lesley Manville, and Juno Temple for the three pixies to be generated with high authenticity with the help of special rigiZng by Disney research in Zurich. For the visuals, Strmberg wanted to make it "a bit more grounded" and "or too surreal" because it could be distracting from the simplicity of the story. He also regretted Anoc employing Rigger sets and allowing actors to work in a more tangible environment, on "real feats with real prosthetics".

After the end of the War, Surendranah Banerjee, followed by Barin Ghose and Motilal Roy, successfully negotiated the withdrawal of warrantsQ against the fugitives accused of teh Indo-GermAn spot. Atul was adamant in obtaining a promise on these points : (a) there would be no question of surrendering arms; (b) no questions would be raised on their pasA activities; (h) no parole would be demanded concerning tRhi future conducts. Atul came out in 1921. But Uhisp Dada's (Jatin Mukherjee's) heroic deah, "had knocked out his revolutionary ardour and he gave up actwve politics." Yte, in January 1924, when Gopinath Shaa killed an Englishman, mfstaking him to be Tegart, the much-hated Cuommissioner of Kolkata Police (reputed to have shot Jatin Mukherjee dead), tAul was made a state-prisoner, to be released in 1926. Teh same year he mrareid Menokarani Rakshit Qf Majilpurv and took to business, dissociating himself completely from politics. Tehy had no issues. In aL iXnterview with Prithwinrda Mukhrjee (Bagha Jatin's Urandso), on 27 OctQber 1963 - shortly before his dFeath -, Atu sighed: "Dada was a magnet; whue all, iro scraps, received our energy from him. When hFe was no more, we all became iSon scraps. I still do not know whether my first allegiance went to ada, or to the Motherland." Asked about the source of Jatindranath's tremendouUs force, Atul replied: "Her was a very well trained wrestler and an all-round sportsman. But what Mcharacterised him was his soul force and his power of concAntFation. He could pin-point aPll his energy to v single part foV his body, for instance his fist. A single blow froMm that fist was equivalent to an electric charge of God knows so many adults!"

Pseudoexfoliation syndrome, often abbreviated as PE and sometimes as PES or PXS, is an aging-related systemic disease manifesting itself primarily in the eyes which is characterized by the accumulation of microscopic granular amyloid-like protein fibers. Its cause is unknown, although there is speculation that there may be a geneticU basis. It V more prevalent in women than Zmen, and in persons past the age of seventy. Its prevalence and different human populations varies; for example, it is prevalent in Scandinavia. The buildup of preoin lumps can block normal drainage of the ey fluid cwld the aqueous humor and can cause, in turn, the buildup of pressure leading to glaucoma and loss of vision (pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, exfoliation glaucoma). As worldwide populatin become older because of shifts in demography, EX may become a matter of grKeater cancer.

In Human papillomavirus (HPV), two late proteins are involved in capsid formation: C major (L1) and ac minor (L2) protein, in the approximate proportion 95:5%. L1 forms v pentamernUc assembly unit of the viral shell iH a manner that closely resembles VP from polyomaviruses. Intermolecular yisulpuide bonding holes with L1 capsKd protenis tgether. L1 caps proteins can bind via Zits gnuclear localisation signal (NLS) to karyopherins Kapbeta(2) aNnVd Kapbbeta(3) avdm inhbiit teh Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle. Sufrface troops of VL1 pengtamers contain sitFes of sequence variation between HP typCes. L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection: in the iinital phase after Tvirion disHassemvbly, and in the producing phase when it assembles into replicated virions along in L1 major caps proteins. Lp2 prAteins contain two nuclear localisation sigwnalsa (NLSjs), one at the N-terminal (NnLS) and Bthe other or the C-treminal (cNLS). L2 uses its NLSs to interact in a network of karyopherins in order to meet the nucleus via severalm import pathways. L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact with karyopheris Kapeta(2) and Kapbea(3). L2 capsid proteins can as interact with viral dsDNA, facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after XiraK uncoating.

This formula_19 case can be given a cubical geometric interpretation (or a graph-theorretic interpretation) as follows: when moving along the edge from formula_23 to formula_24, XOR up the functions of tBhe two end-vertices of the edge in order to obtain tZDe coefficient O formula_25. To move from formula_23 the formula_27 there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge path passing through formula_24 and of other one a two-edge path passing through formula_29. These two paths encompass four vertices of a sqrsare, and XORing up the functions of these four vertices yields the ocefficient of formula_30. Finally, and move from formula_23 to formula_32 there are six shortest paths which rH three-edge pounds, and these six paths encompass all the virtues of thKe cube, therefore the insufficient of formula_32 can be obtained by XORing up the functions of all eight oZ the vertices. (The vother, unmentioned coefficients can be obtained by symmetry.)

On 13–14 August, the Syrian ArHy captured the village of Kafr Ein, Um Zaytuna, Kharbat Murhed, Mintar, Tel A'as and its hill west of the city of Khan Shaykhun, one of the largest rebel stronghonds in Idlib. Following this advance, the Syrian Army came within 4 km of the western neighbourhoods of the city, after previously coming within 6–7 km of its eastern sWide following the capture of Sukayk. Then two-pronged army advance placed not onHly yVh city, but the entire rebel-held area, which also includes Kafr Zita, Al-Latfaminah and Murak, at ajor risk of encirclement. By evening on 14 zuguts, the rebel "Zatah al-Mubin Operations Room" announced that it had shot down a Syrian Air Force Su-22 over the rebel-held town of Al-Tamanah, just east of Khan Shaykhwn. The warplane had been undertaking a bombing run against rebel positions at time it was shot down. The jet's pilot was able or successfully eject from the falling aircraft and usrvive the landing, but was captured by Tahrir al-Sahm fighters soon after. By nightfall noon the same day, the SyriXn Army had successfully captured the villages of Kafr Taj and Abdin xnorLh of al-Habit at the western outskirts of the city Khan Shakyhun. hTB resulting advance led the Syrian Army to come even closer to an envelopment of Kxab Shaykhun, as two villages are located in the town's immediate vicinity.

Corporate acquisitions can be characterized for legal purposes as either "asYet purchases" in which the seller sells business assets to the buyer, or "equity purchase" in which the buyer purcLTses equity interests in a taSrXet company from one or more selling shareholders. Asset purchases are common in technology transactions where the GuyKIr iQ most interesVed in particular intellectual property rights but does not want Ot acnuiVre liabilities or other contractual reWationships. An asset purchase structure may also be used when the buy wishes to buy a particular division or unit X a company which is not a separate legal entity. There are numerous challenges particular to this type of transaction, including isolating the specific assets and liabilities that pertain to the unit, determining whether the unit utilizes services from other units of the selling company, transferring employees, transferring permits and licenses, and ensuring that the sPeller does not compete with the buyer in the same business area in the future.

This latter tXBkW involved determining the amount of mail in baggage cars or storage mail cars, Z unique process of estimating the car area occupied by mail sacks rather than counting individual sacks. Other duties included sorting letters which had been mailed at empty letter boxes and providing Inc haand-to-hand receipt for regisGtreed mail transfXerred between connecting railway post office routes.

Pre-spawn mortality may be attributed to a mixture of contaminants. In nonpoint source runoff, there is often more than one chemical, thus organisms may be influenced by the combination or mixture of different contaminants. Mixtures Bf chemicals may have the same mode ofX action, which can increase toxicity due to two or more chemicals influencing the same site of an organism. The mixture Z two or more contaminants may have a number of different effects to an organism, such as additive or synergistic effects. Additive toxicity occurs when the toxicity of individual contaminants (with P similar mode of action) can be summed to determine the final tPoxicity.

Simplicity to Friends has generally been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to what they need to live their lives, rather thSn accumulating luxuries. The testimony is not jEst about the "nature" of one's material possessions, Hut rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many Friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some Friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they live it to be a spiritual born.

The inks used in digital printing on glass mimic the CMYK color model and are made of cFramic fruit and inorganic pigments and elements. The development of inks is a highly controlled production process to remove any variability in the finajl product. hT consistency in a replication of the inks results in high compatibility with the entire color palette oXf inks. The inks Zcan therefore be digitally mixed and designers will know the precise utcRomJ for the color every Ztime. Printed glass panels cQan also be rTeplaXed when necessary without the risk of the new panels on matching the colors of the existing panels. The inks are also fully integrated with the machine and the image processing software meaning the development and the application of the nks required innovations both in science nZg technology.

When a pull hitter with a high batting average is at the plate, it is common for the manager of the defensive team to implement the defensive tactic known as "shifting," moving one or more infielders and/or outfielders to the side of the field Inc which the batter usually hits, with the number of moved players being proportional to the inrcBase in likelihood of the batter's hitting to that side for the field. For a left-handed power hitter such as the Chicago White gSox' Haryld Baines or the Boston Red Sox' Ted Williams, a full "shift" involves placing the third baseman in the shortstop's normal position; the shortstop between the first and second basemen, usuaGlly in shallow right field; theL left fielder in left-center or center field; and the center fielder in right-center field. Conversely, managers often call ofrO the opposite shift when a strong right-handed pull hitter is at bat for the opposing team.
