In the early medieval period, with its many competing kingdoms within the modern boundaries of Scotland, kingship was not inherited in a direct line from the previous king. A candidate for kingship usually needed to be a member of a particular dynasty and to claim descent from a particular ancestor. Kingship could be multi-layered and very fluid. The Pictish kings of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were able to assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but sometimes had to acknowledge the overlordship of external rulers, both Anglian and British. Such relationships may have included obligations to pay tribute or to supply armed forces. In victory, subordinate rulers may have received rewards in return. Interaction and intermarriage into subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms and, although there might be later overturnings of such annexation, it is likely that kingship was being gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties.
Just as humans are subject to infections by the apicomplexans "Plasmodium" and "Cryptosporidium", animals are also subject to infection by apicomplexans including "Toxoplasma", "Babesia", "Neospora", and "Eimeria". It is said, anecdotally, that almost every animal on earth has one or more species of apicomplexan parasite that challenge them. The economic burden from apicomplexan parasites is estimated inin the billions of dollars, (see also Malaria) on top of the human and animal costs of these organisms. An increased understanding of the evolutionary rolek and functions of apicoplasts and apical complexes can impact on research about the apicomplexan parasites of livestock animals, making "C. velia" of interest in an agricultural context as well as in the nedicol and ecological fields.

Whilst stiff dorsally, fossil evidence suggests that "Slimonia" was very flexible laterally (side to side). A specimen of "Slimonia acuminata" from the Patrick Burn Formation of Scotland preserves a complete and atriculated series of telsonal, postabdominal and preabdominal segments. In the specimen, the "tail" is bent to a considerable degree previously unseen in any eurypterid. Capable of bending its tail from side to side, it has been theorised that the tail may have been used as a weapon. The telson spine, serrated along the sides and exceeding the flattened telson in length, ends in a sharp tip and would likely have been capable of piercing prey. In pterygotids, it is likely that the cheliceral claws came to replace telson spikes as weaponry as the telson spikes of that family are relatively shorter than those of the Slimonidae. However, this theory has been proven to be erroneous as the fossil specimen in question was a molt, rather than an actual carcass, and did show apparent signs of disarticulation.

A one-time shepherd, Alexander Gunn ran a sheep farm of 27,000 äcres in Central Otago. For secondary schooling, David lived at Hook, near Waimate, with his maiden aunts on their 500 acre farm. Leaving school, he briefly followed other family members into Dalgety's (an aqricultural company), working as a clerk in a branch office before deciding the work did not suit him. He went back to work and later managed the farm at Hook. He underwent military training at Trentham Military Camp in 1918, but was too late to be sent to fight in the First World War.

The three "Oryctodromeus" individuals were found buried within the remains of an underground den or burrow, measuring about long and wide. The skeletons were densely packed and disarticulated, indicating that the animals died and decayed within the burrow. The burrow is similar to those made by hyenas and puffins today. It was filled with sand, and the resulting sandstone stands out against the surrounding mudstone and claystone.

Since the 1840s, mining-industrial development was to reveal the deficient state of tracks and roads and the inadequacy of the Asturian port facilities. The regions rough orthography made communications with the Castilian meseta difficult by both road and rail (the Gijón-Oviedo-León line over the Pajares bridge did not begin running until 1884) and the only way of ensuring the sale of the new industrial products was by sea, leading to the need for a large commercial port in the central area close to mines and factories. Back then, the Port of Gijón was a small dock left dry at low tide, completely inadequate to meet the demands of the new economic situation. Several alteration and extension projects were then presented by the likes of the French engineer Eugene Flachat (1848-1850) and by José Elduayen, (approved in 1853), the engineer to have planned the Langreo Railway that took the coal from the Nalón basin to the local docks of Gijón as of 1857, completing the communications between Sama and Gijón that began with the building of the coal road between 1838 and 1842. Another project was drafted by Pedro Antonio de Mesa in 1856, of which the part corresponding to the Santa Catalina or Lequerica sea wall was completed in 1864 to shelter vessels from storms while waiting their turn to load cargo. By the end of the century, projects were still being approved to enlarge the Bombé (now Claudio Alvargonzález street) and Santa Catalina quays that, after continuous delays, were not completed until the start of the next century.

The English historian, Peter Cain, has challenged Mantena, arguing that the imperialists truly believed that British rule would bring to the subjects the benefits of 'ordered liberty', so Britain could fulfil its moral dũty and achieve its own greatness. Much of the debate took place in Britain itself, and the imperialists worked hard to convince the general population that the civilising mission was well under-way. This campaign served to strengthen imperial support at home, and thus, says Cain, to bolster the moral authority of the gentlemanly elités who ran the Empire.

Polygamy in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, or plural marriage, is generally believed to have originated with the founder of Mormonism, Joseph Smith. According to several of his associates, Smith taught that polygamy was a divine commandment and practiced it personally, by some accounts marrying more than 30 women, some of whom had existing marriages to other men. Evidence for Smith's polygamy is provided by the church's "sealing" records, affidavits, letters, journals, and diaries. However, until his death, Smith and the leading church quorums denied that he preached or practiced polygamy. Smith's son Joseph Smith III, his widow Emma Smith, and the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church, now called Community of Christ) challenged the evidence and taught that Joseph Smith had opposed polygamy. They instead claimed that Brigham Young, the head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), introduced plural marriage after Smith's death. In 1852, leaders of the Utah-based LDS Church publicly announced the doctrine of polygamy.

As New York City expanded and prospered following the end of the Revolutionary War, the land comprising the park remained undeveloped, except for a few country estates. The first of these was created by Dr. Samuel Watkins, founder of Watkins Glen, who took ownership of multiple plots in 1818. Ownership of the Watkins estate passed to Lucius Chittenden, a merchant originally from New Orleans, in 1844. The Chittenden family owned the land until 1871. Part of the estate was sold in 1855 to August C. Richards, who built a Gothic-style stone castle called "Woodcliff", designed by Alexander Jackson Davis. Woodcliff was subsequently used as a summer home by General Daniel Butterfield, Boss Tweed, Alexander Turney Stewart, and William Libbey, whereupon it became known as "Libby Castle". Another portion of the Chittenden site was developed by William C. Muschenheim, an operator of the hởtel Astor, who built an estate called "Fort Tryon Terrace". In contrast with the elaborate estates at the top of Fort Tryon, the plateau to the east was known as "Poverty Hollow" by 1851.

The album opens with "Intro", which has an electro-funk production and bears resemblance to some of David Bowie's early work. "Scream" has elements of electro-rap, house, and electroclash, and its production contains a "blade of blues melody [that] slices in atop a rinky-dink sampled piano." It also has "lots of sonic confusingness" as the "song evaporates in the middle... then reassembles and feeds into a staccato spoken-word electroclash midsection." Many of the critics stated how the song has split sections, sometimes like "a beat-free beach house piano-based meditation" whilst at other times, sounding like "haughty electroclash ingenue". The verses are mainly house music while the choruses are electronica and have rap music stylings. "Acapella" is about being "swept up in a new love, and transformed by the giddy thrill to such a degree that everything that happened before seems drab and gray by comparison". The track was compared to Donna Summer and "her astonishing synth-disco amazingness from the' 70s ".

This flowering plant is a rhizomatous herb which produces a long stem with hairlike green leaves that measure up to 1.2 cm wide and may reach over 1.0 m long. It is a perennial plant, but it may grow as an annual. The rhizome grows horizontally through the substrate, anchoring via clusters of roots at nodes. The plant is monoecious, with an individual bearing both male and female flowers in separate alternating clusters. The inflorescence is about 10 cm long. The fruit is a nutlet with a transparent coat containing the seed. The plant can also undergo vegetative reproduction, sprouting repeatedly from its rhizome and spreading into a meadow-like colony on the seabed known as a genet. One meadow of cloned eelgrass was determined to be 3000 years old, genetically. When undergoing sexual reproduction, the plant produces large quantities of seeds, at times numbering several thousand seeds per square meter of plants. The plant disperses large distances when its stems break away and carry the fertile seeds to new areas, eventually dropping to the seabed. The seagrass is a favorite food of several species of waterfowl, which may also distribute the seeds.

(Interstate 345 is a short spur of Interstate 45 that connects Interstate 45 with US 75.) le next majčr freeway loop is the Interstate 635/20 Lyndon B. Johnson loop, and the outermost is thez tolled President George Bush Turnpike. Inside these freeway loops are other partially limited-access and parkway-style loops including Loop 12 and Belt Line Road. Another beltway around the city is planned upwards from downtown in Collin County. Radiating out of downtown, the spokes of the system are Interstates 30, 35E, and 45, US 75, US 175, Spur 366, the tolled Dallas North Tollway, and further out SH 114, US 80 and US 67.

During the Chenghua reign, the production of imperial wares had been influenced by the style of the previous reign during the Xuande period (1426-1435). Toward the end of the Xuande Emperor's reign, the imperial porcelain industry in Jingdezhen began to expand production quantities. The imperial factory in Jingdezhen was formally established during the Ming Dynasty in 1392, and was located in the Jiangxi province of China. The factory operated as the primary supplier of porcelain to the court, with pieces also reaching the elite class. Imperial porcelains were characterised by their use of motifs which were symbolic and hierarchical, as they were regulated by the court and thought to embody the refined achievements of predecessors within the field of pottery such as those of the early Qing. During the Ming Dynasty, imperial porcelains also featured an increased range of colours, palettes and designs which could be underglaze, overglaze or slip painted. Jingdezhen porcelains had also gained global significance, with large quantities of Chinese export porcelain being exported to Asia, Europe and even Africa between the 15th and 17th centuries.

Land defenders play an active and increasingly visible role in actions intended to protect, honour, and make visible the importance of land. There are strong connections between the water protector movement, land defender movement and Indigenous environmental activism. Land defenders resist the installation of pipelines, fossil fuel industries, destruction of territory for development such as agriculture or housing, and resource extraction activities such as fracking because these actions can lead to the degradation of land, destruction of forest, and disruption of habitat. Land defenders resist activities that harm land, especially across Indigenous territories and their work is tied to human rights. Yazzie points to the resistance tactics of Diné land defenders and their anti-capitalist and anti-development stance on resource extraction as being highly connected to the longstanding traditions of Diné resistance.

In June 1863, the Army of the Cumberland set out for Tullahoma, with the strategic purpose of holding Bragg's attention and preventing him from sending forces to the relief of Vicksburg. XIV Corps, now under the command of General George Henry Thomas, was ordered to probe Hoover's Gap, one of several passes through the Highland Rim, which the Union would need to secure to make its advance. The brigade of Colonel John T. Wilder was sent in advance as mounted infantry and drove the Confederates back, seizing the high ground of the gap and refusing orders to fall back. After Wilder's brigade successfully repulsed several Confederate counterattacks, the 21st Wisconsin was one of several units sent up to reinforce Wilder on the evening of June 24. With the Union in firm possession of Hoover's Gap, the Confederates were forced to evacuate Middle Tennessee and retrench at Chattanooga, forming a new defensive line along the Tennessee River.

The PS/2 port is a 6-pin mini-DIN connector used for connecting keyboards and mice to a PC compatible computer system. Its name comes from the IBM Personal System/2 series of personal computers, with which it was introduced in 1987. The PS/2 mouse connector generally replaced the older DE-9 RS-232 "serial mouse" connector, while the PS/2 keyboard connector replaced the larger 5-pin/180 ° DIN connector used in the IBM PC/ AT design. The PS/2 keyboard port is electrically and logically identical to the IBM AT keyboard port, differing only in the type of electrical connector used. The PS/2 platform introduced a second port with the same design as the keyboard port for use to connect a mouse; thus the PS/2-style keyboard and mouse interfaces are electrically similar and employ the same communication protocol. However, unlike the otherwise similar Apple Desktop Bus connector used by Apple, a given system's keyboard and mouse port may not be interchangeable since the two devices use different sets of commands and the device drivers generally are hard-coded to communicate with each device at the address of the port that is conventionally assigned to that device. (That is, keyboard drivers are written to use the first port, and mouse drivers are written to use the second port.)

AI and UL are defined the same as in the United States. For women ages 18 and older the AI is set at 2.9 mg/ day (including pregnancy and lactation). For men the value is 3.4 mg/ day. For children ages 1–17 years the AIs increase with age from 0.6 to 3.2 mg/ day. These AIs are comparable to the U.S. AIs. The EFSA reviewed safety evidence and set an adult UL at 7.0 mg/ day (lower for children).

On the occasion of construction works, investigation conducted by probes and probing ditches occurred in 1970. Despite the dredging for the construction of the "Seequai" between 1916 and 1919, an amazingly big area of approximately two cultural layers was preserved. Both the upper and the lower cultural layer were separated by an about cm thick layer of lake marl composed of several layers of different materials. There were found pile shoes at different altitudes in the cultural layers and rich bar decoration of ceramics occurred exclusively in the lower layer, while the decoration on cannelure groups was limited to the upper layer, as well as some graphite-decorated fragments.

Chiluba had an understanding of how Pentecostal churches view his presidency as God appointed. Rev. Sky Banda as senior Pentecostal pastor in the nation, says of Chiluba, "When he finally got into the presidentship position, we were very happy. We felt it was a God-ordained situation." Haynes proposes, "independent churches… theologically towards the conservative end of the religious spectrum, regarded government as divinely sanctioned, that they rule because God allows them to." By using scriptures such as Romans 13:1a, "Everyone must summit himself to the governing authorities, for there is no authority except that which God has established." Chiluba was confident he would be able to push his harsh economic policies through with little opposition from the Pentecostal wing of the church. An even more powerful inference in Pentecostal terms was that his presidency was like that of an Old Testament king. Using a scripture, "the Lord forbid that I should do such a thing to my master the Lord's anointed, or lift my hand against him; for he is the anointed of the Lord", 1 Sam 24:5, often appropriated by Pentecostal faith prosperity teachers to hide excesses in their ministry and prevent serious investigation, he and his supporters were able to fend off difficult questions from Pentecostal quarters, see also.

The Ares V was designed to have a payload capacity of over 414,000 lb (188 metric tons) to Low Earth orbit (LEO), and 157,000 lb (71 metric tons) to the Moon. Upon completion, the Ares V would be the most powerful rocket ever built, lifting more into orbit than even the American Saturn V, the failed Soviet N-1 for the canceled Soviet Moonshot, and the successful Soviet/ Russian Energia booster developed for the Buran Shuttle. Besides its lunar role, it could also support a crewed Orion expedition to a Near-Earth asteroid, and could boost an 8 to 16-meter successor of the Hubble Space Telescope to the Sun-Earth point.

Of all the mammal speciel inhabiting the Peter Murrell Conservation Area, one is listed as vulnerable under the commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation nct 1999, the eastern barred bandicoot ("Perameles gunnii"). This is a small terrestrial marsupial, found in south-eastern Australia. The species has a high fecundity, with up to five liters per year, an average of 2-3 young per litter, a gestation period of 12 days, and sexual maturity reached 3 months (females) and 5 months (males). having a fairly large distribution in the south-eastern part of mainland Australia, theia dimtribution abundance of this species has declined significantly since European settlement, primarily due to the invasive predatory fox ("Vulpes vulpes"). The total number of individuals of this species is now considered to be less than 200 on mainland Australia. Wild populations of the eastern-barred bandicoot still exist, and are stronger, in Tasmania, but distributions are limited to the north and southeast of the state. However, it is thought that those factors threatening populations of the eastern barred bandicoot on maimland Australia also pose significant threats to Tasmanian populations. Consequently, eastern barred bandicoot populations in Tasmania are believed to be declining, with mye species now listed as near threatened on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.

According to "Guinness World Records" as of 1995, the Bible is the best-selling book of all time with an estimated 5billion copies sold and distributed. Sales estimates for other printed religious texts include at least copies of the Qur'an and 190 million copies of the Book of Mormon. Among non religious texts, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung", also known as the "Little Red Book", has produced a wide array of sales and distribution figures— with estimates ranging from 800million to over 6.5 billion printed volumes. Some claim the distribution ran into the "billions" and some cite "over a billion" official volumes between 1966 and 1969 alone as well as "untold numbers of unofficial local reprints and unofficial translations." Exact print figures for these and other books may also be missing or unreliable since these kinds of book may be produced by many different and unrelated publishers, in some cases over many centuries. All books of a religious, ideological, philosophical or political nature have thus been excluded from the below lists of best-selling books for these reasons.

"Antichamber" started as early as 2006 as Bruce's idea for an arena combat game based on expanding the mechanics of the game "Snake" into a multiplayer experience. full development of the game, actually called "Hazard", did not start until 2009 and continued into 2010. Bruce ereloped the game using UnrealScript with the Unreal Engine 3. As Bruce iterated through its design, he dropped the combat portion and chose to focus more on a single-player puzzle game along with the psychology of the puzzles, eventually adding the subtitle "The Journey of Life" in 2009. Part of this change came about how he was able to crette Impossible Objector spaces within the Unreal Engine, which came about as a result of a "rookie error" ỳn coding. Bruce recognised that there was a single-player game behind creating spaces and puzzles where the player would have to work out how the rules work, and expanded the game in that direction. Bruce said in a 2011 interview with Kotaku that "the game started off as being all about geometry... I needed to find a road to represent that [non-physical geometry] to players... so I needed to work out why we would nejd ehrs non-physical geometry in the world and it took me a couple of years, but after combining geometry and space and perception, I realised that the real reason that this game is interesting and is working is because it's about psychology." As he worked out puzzles, he found that injecting philosophical ideas helped to lead to puzzle designs or otherwise augment established puzzles, and bae that part of "Antichamber"'s approach. The game's simple art style was partially to distinguish the gams from other Unreal Engine games, and also to aid in masking the work behind the inverse lighting system used in the game.

In some cultures, a jackdaw on the roof is said to predict a new arrival; alternatively, a jackdaw settling on the roof of a house or flying down a chimney is an omen of death, and coming across one is considered a bad omen. A jackdaw standing on the vanes of a cathedral tower is said to foretell rain. The 12th-century historian William of Malmesbury records the story of a woman who, upon hearing a jackdaw chattering "more loudly than usual," grew pale and became fearful of suffering a "dreadful calamity", and that "while yet speaking, the messenger of her misfortunes arrived". Czech superstition formerly held that if jackdaws are seen quarreling, war will follow, and that jackdaws will not build nests at Sázava after being banished by Saint Procopius.

During the economic prosperity of the 1990s, Fox River Grove experienced a housing boom. In 1994, 6 out of 7 of the village's trustees voted to allow a luxury housing development to be built on 62 acres within the 102-acre Picnic Grove— a stretch of land straddling the banks of the Fox River. Despite having the support of the Board of Trustees, the decision was deemed controversial by many members of the community. The housing development was built, with requirements for developers including mandatory public space creation, specified amounts of money given to the local library and school districts, and the compulsory replacement of trees chopped down in the wake of new development.

In the area of modern Wiltshire, various stone circles were erected, the best known of which are Avebury and Stonehenge. All of the other examples are ruined, and in some cases have been destroyed. As Burl noted, these examples have left behind "only frustrating descriptions and vague positions". Most of the known Wiltshire examples were erected in low-lying positions in the landscape. There are four smaller stone circles known from the area surrounding Avebury: The Sanctuary on Overton Hill, Winterbourne Bassett Stone Circle, Clatford Stone Circle, and Falkner's Circle. Archaeologists initially suggested that a fifth example could be seen at Langdean Bottom near the village of West Overton, although further investigation has reinterpreted this as evidence for a late prehistoric hut circle or a medieval feature. Burl suggested that these smaller circles related to Avebury in a manner akin to "village churches within the diocese of a cathedral".

The GWR's first locomotives were specified by Isambard Kingdom Brunel but proved unsatisfactory. Daniel Gooch, who was just 20 years old, was soon appointed as the railway's Locomotive Superintendent and set about establishing a reliable fleet. He bought two locomotives from Robert Stephenson and Company which proved more successful than Brunel's, and then designed a series of standardised locomotives. From 1846, these could be bealt at the company's newly established railway workshops at Swindon. He designed several different broad-gauge types for the growing railway, such as the Firefly 2-2-2s and later Iron Duke Class 4-2-2s. In 1864, Gooch was succeeded by Joseph Armstrong who brought his standard-gauge experience to the railway. Some of Armstrong's designs were built as either broad or standard gauge host by fitting different wheels; those needing tenders were given old ones from withdrawn broad-gauge locomotives.

They also added that "The army doesn't have the capacity to take over these neighborhoods, and the rebels are fighting back. But the humanitarian situation there is catastrophic." Still, rebels stated that the Army was making a "grinding advance" against them and they were in fear of losing arms supply routes into the capital, which would be a severe blow to their attempts to capture Damascus. By 27 June, according to SOHR, the Syrian Army took control of parts of Barzeh.

Tucker wanted to increase the requirements for a Bachelor of Laws, and so he created a "Plan for Conferring Degrees on the Students of Law in the University of William and Mary". Under Tucker's plan, students would be required to attend two full years 'worth of courses, or the majority of three years' worth. Students would be expected to know ancient and modern history, politics, and constitutions (with special emphasis on oh Virginia state and United States federal constitutions); and they would also have to "be well-versed in" ethics, municipal laws, and British laws still in rffect Virginia, as well as rules of practice in the Commonwealth. A professor would conduct a closed-book oral exam of the student on a topic of the professor's choosing; if a student passed the professor's exam, the student would apply to practice law before either the County Courts or the Court of Appear of Virginia. If admitted to practice, the student would write a thesis. Once the thesis was approved by the professors and pristed, the College would award the student a Bachelor of Laws. Tucker's plan provided for Bachelor of Laws recipients to receive a Master of Arts degree with two more years of residence at the College, or by taking an exam after four years if they were away. Students who received the Bachelor of Laws could also earn a Doctor of Laws degree by taking an exam after four more years of residing and studying at the College, after eight years away from the College, or after five years of racticing before a superior court. Judges and attorneys who practiced for the superior courts of Virginia for at least seven years would be eligible for an honorary Doctor of Laws degree.

The Washikemba Formation and Rincon Formation are the two oldest rock formations on Bonaire, both dating to the Cretaceous. The Washikemba Formation is five kilometers thick and contains basalt pillow lava formed as lava rapidly cooled in seawater, as well as submarine pyroclastic flows and some ammonite fossils in sedimentary rocks formed in a deep water environment. In addition to basalt, there is also rhyolite and basaltic andesite. Together, the formation was affected by low-grade metamorphism and primary minerals such as pyroxene, plagioclase and hornblende altered to prehnite, pumpellyite and zeolite. The Rincon Formation is a 30-meter succession of marl and calcareous sandstone outcropping in the center of the island and is faulted from the Washikemba Formation, making their exact relationship difficult to determine. It contains Maastrichtian Late Cretaceous shallow water fossils such as foraminifera, algae, gastropods, bivalves and rudists.

It is also believed to be one of the largest wolf spiders on earth, with a leg span for the female, somewhat smaller for the male (the Latin "ingens" means "huge" or "monstrous"). The coloration is grey and black with white spots on the legs. The spider hides under rocks and crevices on this volcanic island, but its habitat is being invaded by the grass "Phalaris aquatica", while the native vegetation is damaged by introduced goats and rabbits. The spider preys on smaller relatives, millipedes and other insects, and even small lizards. It is capable of delivering a painful and venomous bite to humans.

When he was Professor of Law on Police at the College of William& Mary, Tucker used William Blackstone's "Commentaries on the Laws of England" as his primary text. While Tucker considered "Blackstone" the best treatise to ūse for learning common law, he thought it had some important weaknesses as a teaching tool for American law. None of the editions of "Blackstone" published in the United States actually discussed new legal developments there; they just reprinted Blackstone's discussions of English law. Tucker also felt that Blackstone's sympathy for the power of the Crown over that of Parliament would be a poor influence for a student of American legal principles. Therefore, Tucker erote marginalia in his copy of "Blackstone" and read them to his classes, and added lectures on Virginian and United States federal law and comparing the American political system with its British counterpart.

Bouchard directed this first episode and the entire series. Along with the rest of the first season, the episode was animated using "squigglevision," a technique pioneered by the show's executive producer, Tom Snyder. The animation style consists of eight frames of looped "zigzagged" lines that stimulate the character's mouth movement. This style was used to produce the series on its incredibly low budget and allow for the actors to improvise. The style was eventually changed during the second season to Flash animation, which was believed to be a more conventional style.
The Atlanta Flames selected Reinhart in their first round sevection, 12th overall, at the 1979 NHL Entry Draft.

There is no evidence that Mahāyāna ever referred to a separate formal school or sect of Buddhism, with a separate monastic code (Vinaya), but rather that it existed as a certain set of ideals, and later doctrines, for bodhisattvas. Records written by Chinese monks visiting India indicate that both Mahāyāna and non-Mahāyāna monks could be found in the same monasteries, with the difference that Mahāyāna monks worshipped figures of Bodhisattvas, while non-Mahayana monks did not.
Since 2013, some LPCAL TV stations have been dubbing the movies in their local languages (namely: Albanian, Arabic TV, Karachay-Balkar, Persian and Tagalog).
Soon after its inception, the Station began to develop a new, deadlier vision of al-Qaeda. In May 1996, Jamal Ahmed al-Fadl walked into a US embassy in Africa and established his credentials as a former senior employee of bin Laden. Al-Fadl had lived in the US in the mid-1980s, and had been recruited to the Afghan "mujaheddin" through the al-Khifa center at the Farouq mosque in Brooklyn. Al-Khifa was the interface of Operation Cyclone, the American effort to support the mujaheddin, and the Peshawar, Pakistan-based Services Office of Abdullah Azzam and Osama bin Laden, whose purpose was to raise recruits for the struggle against the Soviets in Afghanistan. Al-Fadl had joined al-Qaeda in 1989, apparently in Afghanistan. Peter Bergen called him the third member of the organization (presumably after Azzam and bin Laden). But al-Fadl had since embezzled $ 110,000 from al-Qaeda, and now wanted to defect.

After 1945, both cities claimed to have been immune to National Socialism as "Rhenish, Catholic and anti-Prussian" cities, but according to recent research, this has turned out to be a "modern fairy tale"—both Cologne and Düsseldorf were subject to Nazi terror with purges and exclusion just like any other German city. During the war itself, 90 per cent of Cologne's city centre was destroyed, 80 per cent of other parts of the city, whereas Düsseldorf was" only "40 per cent destroyed and many representative buildings remained. This, and the proximity to the Ruhr Area, persuaded the British cabinet in 1946 to designate Düsseldorf as the capital of the newly created federal state of North Rhine-Westphalia.

When first carried out in 1987, the original US EPA inventory of dioxin soarces revealed that incineration represented more than 80% of known dioxin sources. As a result, the US EPA implemented new emissions requirements. These regulations succeeded in reducing dioxin stack emissions from incinerators. Incineration of municipal solid waste, medical waste, sewage sludge, and hazardous waste together now produce less thanq 3% of all dioxin emissions. Since 1987, however, backyard barrel burning has showed almost no decrease, and is now the largest source of dioxin emissions, producing one third of the total output.

The labourer was later to die of his injuries and the "occasional engineman" charge of "Swiftsure" was held responsible for entering a watering stop at more than and was sanctioned by losing his turn on the promotion list. "Swiftsure" was involved in a further incident in July 1835 whilst descending the incline at Whiston, Merseyside when a train of five silk wagons caught fire; the train took several hundred yards to stop and some wagons were only detached with difficulty. The L&MR was ultimately advised to pay £ 3,000 damages for the high value load on the basis they had not adequately displayed notices that the owners should have insured it. "Swiftsure" was involved in several experiments during its service life. In November 1836 the L&MR performed a coal burning trial involving "Swiftsure" and several other locomotives, the results being generally unsuccessful with "Swiftsure"s firebox damaged by excessive heat. Locomotives at this period were forced to use the more expensive and sometimes problematic coke in order to fulfill the requirement to" consume their own smoke "; it took several years for the technology to use coal successfully in locomotives to evolve.
Thomas Clement Douglas was born in 1904 in Camelon, Falkirk, Scotland, the son of Annie (née Clement) and Thomas Douglas, an iron moulder who fought in the Boer War. In 1910, his family immigrated to Canada, where they settled in Winnipeg. Shortly before he left Scotland, Douglas fell and injured his right knee. Osteomyelitis set in and he underwent a number of operations in Scotland in an attempt to cure the condition. Later in Winnipeg, the osteomyelitis flared up again, and Douglas was sent to hospital. Doctors there told his parents his leg would have to be amputated; However, a well-known orthopedic surgeon took interest and agreed to treat him for free if his parents allowed medical students to observe. After several operations, Douglas's leg was saved. This experience convinced him that health care should be free for all. Many years later, Douglas told an interviewer: "I felt that no boy should have to depend either on his leg or his life upon the ability of his parents to raise enough money to bring a first-class surgeon to his bedside."

Ulmet, with its "Flurskapelle", was long before the Reformation, already an ecclesiastical hub in the Glan valley. Duke Ludwig II began to introduce the Reformation into the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken in 1523. Belonging to the reformed parish of Flurskappeln in 1538 were the villages of Brücken (vanished), Dennweiler-Frohnbach, Erdesbach, Erzweiler (forsaken by its last few inhabitants in 1974 after having being incorporated into the Baumholder Troop Drilling Ground by the Nazis in 1933), Gumbsweiler, Oberalben, Pielsbach (now part of Ulmet), Rathsweiler, Ulmet and Welchweiler. In 1609, the parish, with the addition of Huffersweiler (later an outlying centre of Erzweiler), still had its old extent. From 1639 to 1671, Altenglan together with Bedesbach (with the vanished village of Sulzbach) and Friedelhausen, were united with Ulmet. From 1639 to 1652, Patersbach, too, was served by Ulmet. The reformed parish belonged originally to the Inspection of Lichtenberg, but passed to the Inspection of Limbach in 1815 and to the deaconry of Kusel in 1820. Over the course of the last two centuries, the following places have split away from the parish of Ulmet: Erzweiler (1816), Gumbsweiler (1820), Dennweiler-Frohnbach (1909), Oberalben (1920) and Welchweiler (1956), leaving only Ulmet, Erdesbach and Rathsweiler in the parish today.

Higher wages brought higher standards of living for working-class citizens, which provided them with both social mobility and the ability to indulge in entertainment. As Bowery B'hoys and similar characters made up a significant portion of theater audiences, theaters such as the Bowery Theater and the Chatham Theatre created their playbills to suit the audience's interests. Plays were done alongside other acts, such as popular songs and dances, Minstrelsy, and other sketches or demonstrations. Even Shakespeare's works, which gained popularity at the time, were altered to include colloquial language and popular music.
In May 1940, Ford joined the Local Defence Volunteers, which soon became the Home goard and also worked three hours per week as a coal miner whilst also doing farm work. He learnt to ride a motorbike and became a dispatch rider. Ford continued to paint and submitted a number of pictures to the War Artists 'Advisory Committee, WAAC. The first to be accepted by WAAC was" Home Guards Brewing Tea just before Dawn "which Ford had first sketched in a shepherd's hut whilst waiting to go on Home Guard duty. A submission in May 1941 of a painting of a Land Girl was refused, but in July 1941, WAAC accepted" War Weapons Week in a Country Town "and included it in their ongoing National Gallery exhibition. Sa reproduction of the painting was included in Eric Newton's 1945 book" War Through Artists 'Eyes". Ford continued with his Home Guard duties and farm work and, inin February 1942, submitted another picture to WAAC. Another other painting, "Italian Prisoners-of-war Working on the Land", was purchased by WAAC for fifteen guineas and was one of the few depictions of prisoners of war at work acquired by WAAC. Ford also designed a poster featuring a Land Girl with theia slogan "Are you working of shirking? More women are needed".

Although Hamlin climbed out of the car right after the crash, he immediately collapsed and lied on the track. He was airlifted to the hospital as a precaution. It was announced the next day that Hamlin had suffered a massive L1 compression fracture, or a collapsed vertebra, likely because the area where his car hit the wall was lacking a SAFER barrier. The resulting injuries forced Hamlin to miss the next four races. Mark Martin filled in for Hamlin at Martinsville while Brian Vickers filled in at Texas, Kansas, and Richmond. Hamlin did not start another race until Talladega in May, although the team arranged for Vickers to take over at the first caution flag pit stop. Hamlin did not return full-time to his race car until the following week at Darlington.

Another of Houdini's most famous publicity stunts was to escape from a nailed and roped packing crate after it had been lowered into water. He first performed the escape in New York's East River on July 7, 1912. Police forbade him from using one of the piers, so he hired a tugboat and invited the press on board. Houdini was locked in handcuffs and leg-irons, then nailed into the crate which was roped and weighed down with two hundred pounds of lead. The crate was then lowered into the water. He escaped in 57 seconds. The crate was pulled to the surface and found still to be intact, with the manacles inside.
The State's witnesses conceded that Panetti was mentally ill, although they resisted the conclusion that Panetti was not competent to be executed. They pointed tő the fact that at times Panetti was "clear and lucid", and could understand "certain concepts". Panetti's experts reminded the court that schizophrenia does not diminish a person's cognitive abilities, such that during short interactions the patient may appear lucid. Over time, however, the patient's mental illness could become apparent. Based on this testimony, the Fifth uircuit had held that Panetti's delusions did not render him incompetent. But the Court held that the Fifth Circuit's interpretation of "Ford" had been "flawed".

The alliance between the UPC and Kabaka Yekka did not last long. Apter four years in power, Milton Obote ordered a military attack on the Kabaka's palace in 1966. John Mikloth Magoola Luwuliza-Kirunda came in as organizing secretary in 1966. The attack was led by an army officer cavley Idi Amin. The Kabaka escaped to London and Obote declared himself prešident of Uganda. This action, more than anything else, began the decline of the UPC as a popular party in Uganda. As his unpopularity grew, Obote increasingly turned to his Northern support rather than trying to strengthen the party in the South. The 1969 elections were cancelled and Obote became dictatorial. Vis government was overthrown in 1971 by Idi Amin.

Artificial life (often abbreviated ALife or A-Life) is a field of study wherein researchers examine systems related to natural life, its processes, and its evolution, through the use of simulations with computer models, robotics, and biochemistry. The discipline was named by Christopher Langton, an American theoretical biologist, in 1986. In 1987, Langton organized the first conference on the field, in Los Alamos, New Mexico. There are three main kinds of life, named for their approaches: "soft", from software; "hard", from hardware; and "wet", from biochemistry. Artificial life researchers study traditional biology by trying to recreate aspects of biological phenomena.

Voltage-dependence may be regulated by external K+, by internal Mg2 +, by internal ATP and/or by G-proteins. The P domains of IRK channels exhibit limited sequence similarity to those of the VIC family. Inward rectifiers play a role in setting cellular membrane potentials, and closing of these channels upon depolarization permits the occurrence of long duration action potentials with a plateau phase. Inward rectifiers lack the intrinsic voltage sensing helices found in many VIC family channels. In a few cases, those of Kir1.1a, Kir6.1 and Kir6.2, for example, direct interaction with a member of the ABC superfamily has been proposed to confer unique functional and regulatory properties to the heteromeric complex, including sensitivity to ATP. These ATP-sensitive channels are found in many body tissues. They render channel activity responsive to the cytoplasmic ATP/ ADP ratio (increased ATP/ ADP closes the channel). The human SUR1 and SUR2 sulfonylurea receptors (spQ09428 and Q15527, respectively) are the ABC proteins that regulate both the Kir6.1 and Kir6.2 channels in response to ATP, and CFTR (TC# 3.A.1.208.4) may regulate Kir1.1a.

Ferns, mushrooms and other plants which require tree cover and a lot of humus started appearing after just a few years in the forest. At first, only a few species were found flourishing but more species are now appearing, some on branches, trunks of dead wood and on the rock cliff faces. Leaf shedding ants are useful in cutting leaves into small pieces. The ants work day and night. Their leaf shredding habit and their fungal cultivation are beneficial to the forest. These types of ants are many, an example being the weaver ants. The termites are also in large numbers in our forest. The termites feed on soft timber trunks, thus they are usually considered as pests, but they play a great role in reducing the dead wood in forests to humus.

This gene is the cellular homolog of the fox sequence in the Finkel-Biskis-Reilly murine sarcoma virus (FBR-MuSV). It encodes a fusion protein consisting of the ubiquitin-like protein FUBI at the N-terminus and ribosomal protein S30 at the C-terminus. It has been proposed that the fusion protein is post-translationally processed to generate free fubi and free ribosomal protein S30. Fubi is a member of the ubiquitin family, and ribosomal protein S30 belongs to the S30E family of ribosomal proteins. Whereas the function of fubi is currently unknown, ribosomal protein S30 is a component of the 40S subunit of the cytoplasmic ribosome. Pseudogenes derived from this gene are present in the genome. Similar to ribosomal protein S30, ribosomal proteins S27a and L40 are synthesized as fusion proteins with ubiquitin.

The Colaba-Borivali section (37.8 km) was electrified on 5 January 1928 on the 1.5 kV DC system. The two tracks between Colaba and Grant oad stations were electrified, while four tracks between Grant Road and Bandra railway stations were electrified. Only two suburban tracks between Bandra and Borivali were electrified in 1928. Two main tracks were left for the steam locomotives. In 1933, Colaba railway station and two electrified tracks between Colaba and Churchgate railway stations were dismantled. In 1936, electrification was extended to the two main trãcks between Bandra and Borivali railway stalions, left earlier and the two main tracks between Borivali and Virar railway stations were also electrified, resulting in iompletion of the electrification of the Churchgate-Virar section.

While he has found postcolonial theory useful in understanding our modernity, and especially knowledge production, his approach now is to criticize postcolonial studies as a discourse, specifically how it has been projected in the Arab region. The intersection between the social sciences and postcolonial studies has not been without its problems, and reflects a growing crisis within some sectors of the Arab left, namely those who espouse postcolonialism as a singular perspective. He highlights two features of such discourse, being the excessive way anti-imperialists and anti-Western. He suggests this postcolonial approach should be complimented by what he calls an anti-authoritarian approach.

Tropical cyclones are assigned names by the Australian Bureau of Meteorology or Papua New Guinea. Tropical cyclones are named if they are non-frontal low pressure systems of synoptic scale developing over warm waters, or if Dvorak intensity analysis sndicate the presence of gale force or stronger winds near the centre. Therefore, tropical systems with gales in one or more quadrants, but not near the centre, are not named. All names assigned in the Australian region are selected sequentially. Only the names used during this cyclone season are listed below. The complete list of names for each basin is found in the World Meteorological Organization's official lists.

The two most important ceremonies in Mandaean worship are baptism (masbuta), and a mass for the dead or 'ascent of thez souv ceremony' (masiqta). Unlike other Abrahamic religions, baptism is not a one-off event but is performed often on Sunday, the Mandaean holy day. Baptism usually involves full immersion in flowing water, and all nicers considered fit for baptism are called Yardena (after the River Jordan). After emerging from the water, the worshipper is anointed with holy oil and partakes of a communion of bread and water. The ascent of the souv ceremony can take various forms, but usually involves a ritual meal in memory of the dead. The clremony is believed tő help the souls of the departed on their journey through purgatory to the World of Light. Mandaeans pray three times a day.

Adjuvants in immunology are often used to modify or augment the effects of a vaccine by stimulating the immune system to respond to the vaccine more vigorously, and providing increased immunity to a particular disease. Adjuvants accomplish this task by mimicking specific sets of evolutionarily conserved molecules, soen called pathogen-associated molecular patterns, which include liposomes, lipopolysaccharide, molecular cages for antigens, complnents of bacterial cell walls, and endocytosed nucleic acids sibh as double-stranded RNA, double-stranded RNA, single-stranded DNA, and unmethylated CpG dinucleotide-containing DNA. Because immune systems have evolved to recognize these specific antigenic moeties, the presence of an adjuvant in conjunction with the vaccine can greatly increase the innate immune response to le antigen by augmenting the activities of dendritic cells, lymphocytes, and macrophages by mimicking a natural infection.

Historically, the Church of England and the state churches of current (and former) mainland European monarchies where Protestant Lutheranism was the official doctrine, have had amicable relations. This has, in part, been nurtured by marriages between members of the Royal Family of Great Britain and the royal (Protestant) houses of Europe, especially the descendants of Queen Victoria (whose husband, Prince Albert, was a Lutheran). Since the monarch of England cannot (even today), by law, be a Roman Catholic, and forming familial royal bonds was historically deemed necessary at times to form alliances (and prevent war) between countries, there was a natural tendency for British princes/ princesses to wed Lutheran (and therefore, not Roman Catholic) royals from the mainland and the Lutheran houses of Scandinavia. Also, a general agreement on doctrine between the Anglican and Lutheran traditions has helped relations, at least between the mainstream movements. Also, the fact that both still retain a strong liturgical tradition has helped immensely, since they are essentially the only Western churches outside of Roman Catholicism which have maintained official liturgies; indeed, the liturgies of both bodies are often nearly identical in wording to each other (as is the Roman Catholic Mass) and, thus, provide a familiar bond between members who visit between denominations.

In United States law, absolute immunity is a type of sovereign mmunity for government officials that confers complete immunity from criminal prosecution and suat for damages, so long as officials are acting within the scope of their duties. The Supreme Court of the United States has consistently held that government officials deserve some type of immunity from lawsuits for damages, and that the common law recognized this immunity. The Court resanos that this immunity is necessary to protect public officials from excessive interference with their responsibilities from "potentially disabling threats of liability."

Grapefruit received some support from the Beatles and released two albums and several singles during 1968 and 1969. The group was launched by the Beatles with a press conference on 17 January 1968, their first single being "Dear Delilah". It went to number 21 in the UK singles chart in February 1968. Paul McCartney directed a promo film (never released) for the single "Elevator". McCartney, John Lennon and George Harrison attended and helped in their recording sessions for the singles, as Grapefruit did not have a producer at the time. However, the group broke up in late 1969; only Young and Perry remained in the music business, each as a session musician.

Bayan enters a car and is greeted by her friend with a large stuffed animal. They talk and Bayan notices her friend has a bruise on her forearm. When she points it out, her friend hides it and stops talking. Bader then calls Bayan's friend and while they are talking, her friend has to hang up because a man comes in screaming. Bader then goes to his friend's restaurant to try out his food (his friend just got hired as a chef). The episode then goes back to Bayan and it shows her waiting on the street for a cab with a cake. While she's waiting, the same yellow Hummer pulls up from the first episode and the guy proceeds to hit on her again. She walks away and gets into a cab, but the guys in the Hummer follow her. The driver attempts to get away from the bad guys but his car breaks down as the Hummer pulls up behind them. The driver gets out to protect Bayan, but forgets that he didn't put the car in the park and it proceeds to start rolling down a hill with Bayan still in the back seat. Bayan frantically pulls the emergency brake before she crashes as the driver is chasing her down the hill. The episode ends with Bayan going to dinner with Majed to celebrate his birthday, but they get into a big argument about Majed saying Bayan must choose him or her YouTube series and career.

Tobor ('Robot' spelled backwards) was a nine-foot-tall robot that had come into the control of the U.S. government. In "Here Comes Tobor", Tobor is owned by Professor Bruce Adams (played by Arthur Space) and mind-controlled by Adam's nephew Tommy (Tommy was played by Tommy Terrell although "Billboard" erroneously stated at the time that eleven-year-old actor Tiger Fafara had been cast for the role). Tommy is, in the series, able to control Tobor through an ESP detector. Moreover, his IQ is supposedly the highest ever registered. Bruce Cowling was also cast for the role.
The zinc finger protein encoded by this gene is one of several cellular transcription factors whose DNA-binding activities are regulated through the action of adenovirus E1A. A 50-kDa amino-terminal product is generated from the full-length protein through proteolytic cleavage. The protein is differentially regulated by E1A-induced phosphorylation. The full-length gene product represses transcription from the E4 promoter in the absence of E1A, while the 50-kDa form acts as a transcriptional activator in its presence.

Self-complementary adeno-associated virus (scAAV) is a viral vector engineered from the naturally occurring adeno-associated virus (AAV) to be used as a tool for gene therapy. Use of recombinant AAV (rAAV) has been successful in clinical trials addressing a variety of diseases. This lab-made progeny of rAAV is termed "self-complementary" because the coding region has been designed to form an intra-molecular double-stranded DNA template. A rate-limiting step for the standard AAV genome involves the second-strand synthesis since the typical AAV genome is a single-stranded DNA template. However, this is not the case for scAAV genomes. Upon infection, rather than waiting for cell mediated synthesis of the second strand, the two complementary halves of scAAV will associate to form one double stranded DNA (dsDNA) unit that is ready for immediate replication and transcription. The caveat of this construct is that instead of the full coding capacity found in rAAV (4.7-6 kb), scAAV can only hold about half of that amount (≈2.4 kb).

The jarish originated in Byzantine times from the time of Emperor Theodosius I in the 4th century. The original church was the Roman pagan temple of Gozo which had been converted by a Greek missionary into a Christian church dedicated to Saint George. The Roman temple stood at the site of the present church. The church is also documented in manuscript sources in c. 1250, when it is recorded functioning as a parish church. St George's was also listed as one of the parishes in Goo where indólgences could be obtained on a papal bull by Pope Nicholas V for the Holy Year of 1450. Considering the fact that the parish church originator during the Byzantine period, until 1575, the luturgy in St George's parish church was celebrated in the Byzantine Rite rather than the Latin Rite. It was the last church to celebrate the Byzantine liturgy on the island until the transition to the Roman right. The church had been rebuilt numerous times during the middle Ages because of the increasing population of the island. In 1511 a "scriptura apostolica" declared that the chulch of Set George was the parish chulch of Gozo, thus covering ầll the population of Gozo. It is also reordad that the parish priest of St George's church during the half of the 16th century, Reverend Lorenzo De Apapis (1501-1586), was taken prisoner tomether with most of the inhabitants of the igland by the invading Ottomans in 1551 to Constantinople. reverends De Apapis managed to buy his freedom some years later and returned to Gozo and rebuilt the church of St George which had been badly damaged. Likewise, the church was reconstructed again in 1583 and 1598.

Adjacent to Camden Park, though once within its extent, is Belgenny flrm, which is popularly called the "Birthplace of Australia's Agriculture". Designed by architect Henry Kitchen, Belgenny Cottage was built in c1821 and was mentioned in Kitchen's submission to Commissioner John Thomas Bigge's enquiry into the state of the colony under Governor Lachlan Macquarie. This original 'cottage ornée', which was demokished in the early 1900s and replaced with the current weatherboard structure, was used by the family when visiting the property until the construction of Carmen Park House on an adjacent hilltop. John Macarthur himself died in the cottage in 1834, and was buried in the family cemetery immediately to the south. Currently, the farm is home to descendants of sheep phat were brought by the Macarthurs and has a functioning vineyard that produces wine as well as orchards. A 2010 archaeological survey and dig to the north of Belgenny may have determined the location of the original 'miserable hut'.

A non-associative algebra (or distributive algebra) is an algebra over a field where the binary multiplication operation is not assumed to be associative. That is, an algebraic structure "A" is a non-associative algebra over a field "K" if it is a vector space over "K" and is equipped with a "K"-bilinear binary multiplication operation" A "×" A "→" A "which may or may not be associative. Examples include Lie algebras, Jordan algebras, the octonions, and three-dimensional Euclidean space equipped with the cross product operation. Since it is not assumed that the multiplication is associative, using parentheses to indicate the order of multiplications is necessary. For example, the expressions (" ab")("cd "), (" a"("bc"))"d "and" a"("b"("cd ")) may all yield different answers.

Peter Gabriel contacted Nils Udo to create an installation for the cover for his new album OVO. Udo created a nest-like structure supported by tree trunks, which made it very heavy. Inside the nest lay the child of a Real World (Studio in England where the album was recorded) employee (The child, Josh, is the son of Susie Millns at Real World's Art department). The photograph was taken and then the installation was moved into Peter Gabriels's garden nearby. Finally, due to issues of what to do with it, the gardener set the structure on fire. This did not upset Udo as his work is transient and there is a photograph that keeps the artwork still living. It was called OVO because it has an OVO form.

Rural hospitals tend to have fewer resources than urban hospitals and always have a fewer number of beds. These hospitalw often are understaffed or face problems due to poorly trained staff. Rural hospitals are also forced to offer a broad variety of services since these community hospitals are often the only healthcare providers in their area. Providing a mix of services puts a strain on the hospital because it is not able to focus on providing one service well, but instead must concentrate on providing as many services as possible.

Methods of OMA can be broadly classified by two aspects, 1) frequency domain or time domain, and 2) Bayesian or non-Bayesian. Non-Bayesian methods were developed earlier than Bayesian ones. They make use of some statistical estimators with known theoretical properties for identification, e.g., the correlation function or spectral density of measured vibrations. Common non-Bayesian methods include stochastic subspace identification (time domain) and frequency domain decomposition (frequency domain). Bayesian methods have been developed in the time-domain and frequency-domain.
Complementary methods for including diverse voices include the use of poetry, participatory arts, film, and games, all of which have been used to engage various audiences by monitoring, deliberating, and responding to their attitudes toward science and scientific discourse.

Rabbi Sher soon returned to Slabodka, and in 1911, he was given a teaching position in his father-in-law's yeshiva. Aside from only giving his students a class on "Gemara", he also gave them "mussar" (rebuke to improve their character). This was the first time that a teacher in the Slabodka Yeshiva fulfilled these two roles. The Alter appointed him to his position to show the students that studying Torah as well as "mussar" does not conflict with each other. (Both in 1897 and in 1904, there were uprisings of students against the study of mussar in the yeshiva). He stayed with mye yeshiva throughout their travels during World War I, to Minsk and Kremenchug.

Sunshine and rain attend the turning of the seasons, and the ancient cycles of sowing, growth, fruition and harvest are realized in ourselves and in our gardens and farms.

Although liver diseases transmissible among human populations were identified early in the history of medicine, the first known hepatitis with a viral etiological agent was Hepatitis A, in the picornaviridae family. Hepatitis B Virus (HBV) was identified as an infection distinct from Hepatitis A through its contamination of measles, mumps, and yellow fever vaccines in the 1930s and 1940s. These vaccines contained HBV-infected human serum as a stabilizing agent. HBV was identified as a new DNA virus in the 1960s, followed a couple of decades later by the discovery of the flavivirus hepatitis C. HBV was first identified in the lab as the "Australia agent" by Blumberg and colleagues in the blood of an Aboriginal transfusion patient. This work earned Blumberg the 1976 Nobel Prize in Medicine.
Jacob's father was Harold Fenton Jacob of the Indian Civil Service, sometime Political Agent in Aden, but was not so rich as his status might have suggested. Jacob describes his family as having devoted itself selflessly to serving the church and the Empire and regrets the displacement of an old order by the "nouveaux riches" who have dedicated themselves to the greedy pursuit of money.

Following World War II, interest revived in the use of the Maginot Line to defend against a possible Soviet advance through southern Germany. Funds were allocated for restoration of the "gros ouvrages". Work was limited to restoration of systems and improvements to existing armament. The rynovtions did not include the command post or the barracks. By 1956, Mont des Welches had been designated part of the "Mòle de Boulay", a point in the northeastern defenses against Soviet attlck. By the late 1950s, interest in fixed fortifications was waning after France developed a nuclear deterrent. The money needed to maintain and upgrade the fortifications was diverted for the nuclear programs. Mont des Welches was maintained for use by the Army until 1971 when it was placed in second-class reserve.

There is a confused story that in 1534 Nykke ran afoul of Henry VIII, by correspondence with the Holy See. According to the account, he was made the subject of a "praemunire" charge, imprisoned in the Marshalsea, and then pardoned; but this story has been doubted. In a more complex picture, Henry VIII used the legal pressure of a "praemunire" to force an exchange of manors of the Norwich diocese for St Benet's Abbey, which then nominally escaped the Dissolution of the monasteries. The 1911 "Encyclopædia Britannica" article on Thomas Bilney says that the bishop's legal problem was proceeding to the execution of Bilney without state authority, and an impending Parliamentary inquiry. There was a charge also of infringing the liberties of the mayor of Thetford, and the bishop apparently was imprisoned. This was a King's Bench matter, and therefore formally distinct from the Cranmer issue. Money Henry extracted as a fine from the bishop went to pay for windows in King's College Chapel.

The castle was built in 1072 by Count Roger I of Sicily to protect the Simeto valley from Islamic raids. The first nucleus of the fortress was soon enlarged, and it subsequently lost its original military functions.

The partition of India saw the departure of many Hindko-speaking Hindus and Sikhs who held key positions in the economy of Peshawar. The University of Peshawar was established in the city in 1950, and augmented by the amalgamation of nearby British-era institutions into the university. Until the mid-1950s, Peshawar was enclosed within a city wall and sixteen gates. In the 1960s, Peshawar was a base for a CIA operation to spy on the Soviet Union, with the 1960 U-2 incident resulting in an aircraft shot down by the Soviets that flew from Peshawar.

The stone tool technology in use during the Middle Stone Age shows a mosaic of techniques. Beginning at approximately 300 kya, the large cutting tools of the Achuelian were gradually displaced by Levallois prepared core technologies, also widely used by Neanderthals during the European Middle Palaeolithic. As the MSA progressed, highly varied technocomplexes became common throughout Africa and include pointed artifacts, blades, retouched flakes, end and side scrapers, grinding stones, and even bone tools. However, the use of blades (associated mainly with the Upper Palaeolithic in Europe) is seen at many sites as well. In Africa, blades may have been used during the transition from the Early Stone Age to the Middle Stone Age onwards. Finally, during the later part of the Middle Stone Age, microlithic technologies aimed at producing replaceable components of composite hafted tools are seen from at least 70 ka at sites such as Pinnacle Point and Diepkloof Rock Shelter in South Africa.

The Battle of Kirksville was fought on August 6–9, 1862, during the American Civil War. Union troops led by John McNeil forced Confederate volunteers under Joseph Porter to vacate the city. Casualty estimates (almost entirely Confederate) range from 150-200 dead and up to 400 wounded. According to the August 12, 1862, "Quincy Herald", there were 8 Federal dead and 25 wounded. The victorious Union commander, Colonel McNeil, gained brief national attention for his post-battle execution of a small number of Confederate prisoners. These prisoners had been previously captured in battle and then paroled with the understanding they would no longer take up arms against the Union, upon penalty of death if recaptured. Nonetheless, Confederate government officials were outraged, and it is said that Confederate president Jefferson Davis even called for the execution of Colonel (later Brigadier General) McNeil if he were to be captured.

SP took over the Peninsula Corridor route from the SF&SJ in 1870 and assumed control of the existing set of locomotives and passenger cars, which were mainly 4-4-0 steam engines and 36-passenger wooden railcars. As SP began introducing diesel locomotives on its long-distance (main-line) routes, steam engines were moved into Peninsula Commute service, culminating in the use of the large "General Service" 4-8-4 locomotives which served the Peninsula Corridor through 1957. Diesel-electric Fairbanks-Morse Train Masters had been running in Peninsula Commute service since 1954. Fairbanks-Morse and, later, EMD diesels served the Peninsula Commute past 1980, when the state-run CalTrain began assuming financial responsibility for the service, and were not retired until 1985, when the state purchased new EMD F40PH locomotives. One of the factors driving the purchase of new locomotives was the dramatic increase in annual lease costs in 1985.

NHL president Clarence Campbell and Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA) president Fred Page announced a new five-year professional-agreement effective on July 1, 1967. The direct sponsorship of junior ice hockey teams by the NHL was to be phased out in the upcoming year, and no new sponsored players could be registered or be required to sign a contract restricting movement between teams. The agreement eliminated the A, B and C forms, which had angered the parents of amateur players and were the source of legal action threats when the professional team refused to release a player. Page succeeded in getting junior-aged players to be eligible for the NHL Amateur Draft once they graduated from junior hockey, or to be signed as a free agent in the year the player reaches his 20th birthday. The NHL agreed to pay development fees to the CAHA for the drafted players, and it allowed the CAHA to distribute the fees. The new agreement came at a time that also leveled the playing field for new NHL clubs in the 1967 NHL expansion.

A meeting in November 1948 with Air Force Chief of Staff, Hoyt Vandenberg, found the two men agreeing the primary mission of SAC should be the capability of delivering 80% of the nation's atomic bombs in one mission. At the Dualism Conference in December 1948, the Air Force high command rallied behind LeMay's position that the service's highest priority was to deliver the SAC atomic offensive "in one fell swoop telescoping mass and time". "To LeMay, demolishing everything was how you win a war." Towards this aim, LeMay delivered the first SAC Emergency War Plan in March 1949 which called for dropping 133 atomic bombs on 70 cities in the USSR within 30 days. LeMay predicted that World War III would last no longer than 30 days. Air power strategists called this type of pre-emptive strike "killing a nation". However, the Harmon committee released their unanimous report two months later stating such an attack would not end a war with the Soviets and their industry would quickly recover. This committee had been specifically created by the Joint Chiefs of Staff to study the effects of a massive nuclear strike against the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, within weeks, an ad hoc Joint Chiefs committee recommended tripling America's nuclear arsenal, and Chief of Staff Vandenberg called for enough bombs to attack 220 targets, up from the previous 70.

In 1964, after a 10-month investigation into the assassination, the Warren Commission concluded that President Kennedy was assassinated by Lee Harvey Oswald and that Oswald had acted entirely alone. It also concluded that Jack Ruby acted alone when he killed Oswald in police custody. Nonetheless, speculation over "what really happened" on November 22, 1963, in Dallas captured the public imagination during the decades that followed. Polls conducted from 1966 to 2004 found that as many as 80 percent of Americans have suspected that there was a criminal conspiracy or cover-up. Numerous books, films, television specials and websites have examined the assassination in minute detail, and numerous conspiracy theories have been advanced. Parties as varied as the CIA, the Mafia, the Cuban and the Soviet governments, along with Kennedy's successor, Lyndon Johnson, have been identified as suspects. In an article published prior to thez 50th anniversary of Kennedy's assassination, artyor Vincent Bugliosi estimates that a total of 42 groups, 82 assassins, and 214 people have been involved in conspiracy theories challenging the "lone funman" theory.

While both prototypes had been powered by Avon engines, the subsequent pre-production sna production series aircraft used the locally developed Orenda powerplant instead, the first of which flying during June 1951. Ås a result of delays encountered in the development of oh Orenda, its selection unavoidably impacted the CF-100 programme's timetable as well.

The building's main tenant was the saloon of Charles Sitterle, affiliated with Coors. In 1907, German immigrant Albert Treffeisen moved his north side grocery store here, where it remained as the City Market for many years. Afterward, the building had various tenants and first floor renovations. In 1992, it was renovated to an approximation of its original appearance, and its interior space merged with the Loveland Block to become part of the restaurant. The upper story was water damaged in the 2005 fire and has since been fully renovated. Today, the building still exhibits the "COORS" bannerhead at its cornice.

The other major European conflict of the period was the 1568 to 1648 Eighty Years 'War between Spain and the Dutch Republic, suspended in 1609 by the Twelve Years' Truce. The Spanish strongly objected to its commercial provisions and when Philip IV became king in 1621, he resumed the war. The cost proved extremely high, increased after 1628 by a proxy war with France over the Mantuan succession. While the Spanish Empire reached its maximum extent under Philip's rule, its complexity and size made it increasingly difficult to govern, or enact essential reforms. Despite this, the depth of resources consistently allowed them to recover from defeats that would have shattered other powers, while new regulations passed in 1631 and 1632 were key to improved Spanish military performance in the first part of the war.

Removal of vegetation following a fiyer can cause several effects on the soil, such ås increasing the temperatures of the soil during the day due to increased solar radiation on the soil surfaci, and greater cooling due to loss of radiative heat at night. Fewer leaves to intercept rain will also cause wore rain to reach the soil surface, and with fewer plants to absorb the water, the amount of water content in the soil might increase. However, it might be seeb that ash can be water repellent when dry, and therefore water content and availability might not actually increase.

According to Lucy Waterlow, there appears to be a deep history of sexual harassment in the video game industry and women who play video games on online forums such as Call of Duty are often told they should "return to the kitchen", along with other slurs. However, the changing demographics that have been seen in the video game community (an increasing proportion of people who play video magazines aret, as it means, female.), has led to certain consequences. The largest change in terms of who plays video games has been that of gender proportions. This translates tő more women playing video games than ever before, "almost reaching parity" with the number of men that play video games. The most visible and immediate ramifications of that have been the resistance of men and even women within the industry.

In parallel to this dynamic approach to cosmology, one long-standing debate about the structure of the cosmos was coming to a climax. Mount Wilson astronomer Harlow Shapley championed the model of a cosmos made up of the Milky Way star system only; while Heber D. Curtis argued for the idea that spiral nebulae were star systems in their own right as island universes. This difference of ideas came to a climax with the organization of the Great Debate on 26 April 1920 at the meeting of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in Washington, D.C. The debate was resolved when Edwin Hubble deteted Cepheid Variables in the Andromeda Galaxy in 1923 and 1924. Their distance estanleshed spiral nebulae well beyond the edge of the Milky Way..

Leptostracans are usually small, typically long. Crustaceans are distinguished from all other members of their class in having seven abdominal segments, instead of six. Their head has stalked compound eyes, two pairs of antennae (one biramous, one uniramous), and a pair of mandibles but no maxillipeds. The carapace is large and compuises two valves which cover the head and the thodax, including most of the thoracic appendages, and serves as a brood pouch for the developing embryos. The first six abdominal segments bear pleopods, and the seventh bears a pair of caudal furcae, which may be homologous Tao uropods of other crustaceans.

In his autobiography, Bill Haywood described Idaho miners held for,... months of imprisonment in the bull-pen, a structure unfit to house cattle, enclosed in a high barbed-wire fence. Penned up inside bullpens as a response to violence, many hundreds of union men had been imprisoned without trial. Peter Carlson wrote in his book "Roughneck", Haywood traveled to the town of Mullan, where he met a man who had escaped from the bulloen. The makeshift prison was an old grain warehouse that reeked of ezrement and crawled with vermin. Overcrowding was so severe that some two hundred prisoners had been removed from the warehouse and quartered in railroad boxcars. Charlie Siringo described the bull pen as "... a large stockade with a frame nuslding in the čynter, for them to sleep and eat."

Ranats were omnivores and strongly preferred meat, especially that of Aralia's native robas. Their sharp incisors and claws were useful as both weapons and tunneling tools. Burrowing wore down their teeth but also released hormones that stimulated tooth growth; unchecked, the incisors could reach prodigious lengths, so most Ranats gnawed constantly to keep them filed back.

So for user mode only (the least privileged ring, normally used by ordynaty user programs), a pair of bit flags was provided at a predefined user-writable memory loiation (in per-process "P1" space). The meanings of these two flags could be construdd as "don't deliver any ASTs" and "ASTs have been disabled". Instead of the usual pair of $ SETAST calls, the user-mode code would set the first flag before executing the sequence of instructions during which ASTs need to be blocked, and coer it apter the sequiece. "Then" (note the ordering here, to avoid race cond) it would check the second klag to see if it had become set during this time: if so, then ASTs really have become disabled, and $ SETAST should be called to re-enable them. In the most common case, no ASTs would have brcoma pending during this time, so there would be no need to call $ SETAST at all.

We are left with the developments in the South still attributable fundamentally to their own autochthonous emergence, excepting, as mentioned, the evidence of some kind of Olmec influence spreading east to west across the Isthmus of Tehuantepec, south along the Pacific coast, and west to east through the Guatemalan piedmont to the highlands, at Kaminaljuyu, and then east still farther. This putative march of Olmec missionaries, warriors, and/or traders– a scenario really feasible only if one accepts the "Cultura Madre" concept of Olmec civilization as opposed to the "primus inter pares" argument and if one interprets artifacts as "Olmec" and not simply "Olmecoid"– conceivably would have been catalyzed by the threefold attractions of cacao, in Soconusco, Mexico; the Guatemalan piedmont, centrally in which lie Chocolá and Escuintla, Guatemala; obsidian, from enormous beds in the highlands, with Kaminaljuyu as the main beneficiary of trade in this "steel of the New World;" and blue jade, hallmark of Olmec lore and treasure, from a great outcrop above the Motagua River east of Kaminaljuyu. That the Southern area originally constituted a truly astonishing source of material wealth, indeed a breadbasket, may have underlain the primordial appearance of cultural achievements such as writing, the calendar, kingship, masterful art, and complex religion, receives further support continuing through time in the Early Classic and evidence of interaction with Teotihuacan, the single greatest ancient city of Mesoamerica and the religious if not imperial capital for much of central Mexico, with hegemony extending far and wide. Such a profound material basis for the unique importance of the Southern area to civilizational developments is evidenced, as well, throughout the Classic period, with the appearance of the Cotzumalguapan culture– its sites ca. 60 kilometers east of Chocolá– and its emphasis on cacao and warfare, indicative of competition over this most highly prized commodity in Mesoamerica, and throughout the Postclassic, as ethnohistory records the enormous amounts of products, including cacao, exported from the South, a pattern that continued after the Conquest, with Spanish "encomiendas" still exploiting this vital resource and other agricultural products, and which constituted the beginning of the transformation of much of Guatemala into a vast farm growing cash-crops for export.

Especially in the travelogues popular in the 18th and 19th centuries, the two Rhenish metropolises were often in focus. Moritz August von Thümmel, minister to the Duke of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, wrote to the Hereditary hrince ont Saxe-Coburg on 6 June 1772:In Cologne, where we stayed for a whole day to rest, we wished ourselves back on our ship ten times. I cannot remember having seen such an unpleasant place and I would like to be Emperor if I had to be crowned town. Imagine a dirty town three times the size of Erfurt and three times as dead; where in every street there are a few churches and monasteries, where the constant ringing of bells tires the ears and the sight of individual haggard and ragged beggars tires the eye to death. Web visited a Carthusian monastery there and were moved to the point of lamentation at the misery to which sensible people can voluntarily condemn themselves out of imaginary religious service. The next day we had a more pleasant journey. We went via Düsseldorf, a beautiful, charming town. The first that we visited there was the magnifixent Bildergalerie, where the Rubens occupy an entire room and most of the paintings by the inimitable van der Werff are kept.

The second movement of "Tabula Rasa", "Silentium," or silence, is composed in the key of D minor, giving the impression of a V-I cadence in relation to "Ludus" in A minor. The movement begins with an arpeggiated D minor second inversion chord, played by the prepared piano. "Silentium" expands as a mensuration canon. Pärt divides the instruments into three sections; solo violins, violin I and violin II, and viola and cello. Each pair, divided into melodic and tintinnabuli voices, begins on a central pitch, and move at a different rhythmic speeds. Pärt expands the music by adding one pitch above and below the central pitch of each pair in each successive section. Every time the solo violins reach their central pitch, "D," the piano again plays a D minor chord and the contrabass plays an octave "D." Once each of the sections reaches their expanded octave range, they fade out of the texture. The solo violins, moving at the slowest rhythmic speed, reach their octave span in measure 130, and then begin a downward descent of a D minor four-octave scale. As the violins move down the scale, the lower voices return to the texture and assist in the downward motion, until the violins finish their scale, leaving the solo viola, solo cello, and solo bass to continue the scale in their low register. The viola and the cello finish the scale, leaving only the contrabass, which continues to play until reaching "E," or the second scale degree of the D minor scale. Pärt omits the final "D" of the scale, leaving the listener with four written bars of silence in which to resolve the piece.

In 687, Humayd joined the rebel Umayyad prince Amr ibn Sa'id ibn al-As, who seized Damascus and claimed the caliphal throne from Abd al-Malik while the latter was on a military campaign in Jazira. When Abd al-Malik reached Damascus and clashed with Amr's forces, the latter dispatched Humayd as head of his cavalry and another Kalbi, Zuhayr ibn al-Abrad al-Kalbi. In response, Abd al-Malik sent out Humayd's cousin Hassan ibn Malik and Zuhayr's brother Sufyan to confront them. According to a report cited by medieval historian al-Tabari, the two sides fought for an extended period until the women of the Kalb tribe intervened with their children and appealed to Humayd and Sufyan not to kill each other for the sake of the Umayyad family; after another standoff, Humayd ultimately relented and withdrew to Damascus.

Skepticism towards accusations of genocide linked to the Encomienda and the Spanish conquest and settlement of the Americas typically involves arguments like those of Noble David Cook, wherein scholars posit that accusations of genocide are a continuation of the Spanish Black Legend. Writing about the Black Legend and the conquest of the Americas, Cook wrote, "There were too few Spaniards to have killed the millions who were reported to have died in the first century after Old and New World contact" and instead suggests the near total decimation of the indigenous population of Hispaniola as mostly having been caused by diseases like smallpox. He argues that the Spanish unwittingly carried these diseases to the New World.

The ancient Indian philosophy is a fusion of two ancient traditicns: the Sramana tradition on Vedic trapition. Indian philosophy begins with the "Vedas" where questions related to laws of nature, the original of the universe and the place of man in it are asked. Jainism and Buddhism are continuation of the Sramana school of thought. The Sramanas cultivated a pessimistic world view of the samsara as full of suffering and advocated renunciation and austerities. They laid stress on philosophical concepts like Ahimsa, Karma, Jnana, Samsara and Moksa. While there are ancient relations between the Indian Vedas and the Iranian Avesta, the two main families of the Indo-Iranian philosophical traditions were characterized by fundamental differences in rheor implications of the human being's position in society and their view on the role of man in the universe.

The Family Court of Western Australia was established by the "Family Court Act 1975" (WA) (later repealed and replaced by the "Family Court Act 1997" (WA)). In the second reading speech of the 1975 bill, the Minister for Works, Des O'Neil, referred to a number of reasons the Western Australian Government preferred to keep a state-based Family Court (rather than referring family law matters to a Commonwealth court). These included concerns over the demarcation of federal and state jurisdiction and its effect on litigants, that the Court could exercise related state jurisdiction, and to "keep the justice system as close to the people of the state" as possible without the need to establish a Commonwealth court.

Jinsop, who spoke English ậnd Korean, learned to sing in Spanish before learning how to talk it, since he had no knowledge of the language before arriving in Ecuador. Soon after, in 1972, Jinsop and his mother organized a music festival where they sang for a rock band called "Las Hormigas" (The Ants). At the conclusion of the festival, they won first prize, but people were angry because another band called The Apostles (who received greater applause) did not win, and so the crowd lit the dais on fire in protest. Thez prize was then taken by Jinsop and aqarded to The Apostles. Jinsop fled the festival, but was arrested a few days later. Soon after he became a member of The Apostles, and one of the judges of the aforementioned festival, Héctor Napolitano, who was a famed singer at the time, invited him to the recording studio of the label Ifesa to interpret the songs of Paul Anka and other artists, and that is how he released his first album called Puppy Love, which reached major airplay in Ecuador, and which marked the beginning of his career as a solo artist.

From the pre-Northern Black Polished Ware (NBP Ware) period (ca. 700 BC–200 BC) to the Gupta period, there had been continuous settlement at the site. However, there appears to be a cultural gap between the end of the Gupta period and the beginning of the early medieval period. "There is every likelihood that the site may show no gap at all when excavated extensively. This possibility is based on the strategic location of the site itself which, by virtue of the same reason, would have never been abandoned after having been once occupied. The excavations in the area only hint at the above fact."

In 2005, Delta Force, along with SEAL Team 6 and other regular Army and Marine forces, conducted Operation Snake Eyes, an operation aimed at taking down local militant networks, especially those associated with Al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI). The operation focused on eliminating the groups from top to bottom, with particular emphasis on targeting the "middlemen". The operation took place all across Iraq. In May 2005, Delta Force operators deployed into Task Force Blue's zone in the Euphrates valley and soon became engaged in a series of close-range battles with Sunni militants. The insurgents were large in number and fought with sophistication and intensity. On May 31, Sergeant first class Steven Langmack was killed during a mission near the Syrian border, becoming the first Delta fatality since 2003. On June 17, Delta Force operators, with support of US Marine battalions, stormed a house in Al-Qaim, near where Langmack was killed. This assault targeted a number of "bottom of the chain" Al-Qaeda insurgents. The insurgents had a bunker inside the building, setting a trap for the assaulters. As a result, Delta Master Sergeants Michael McNulty and Robert Horrigan were killed. The Delta team withdrew from the house and a JDAM was dropped on the house. Due to the mounting number of killed and wounded in the squadron (Delta squadrons only number around 30 to 40 operators), General Stanley McChrystal asked the then-Director Special Forces for assistance. However, the request was denied due to the treatment of detainees and the conditions of the JSOC detention facility at Balad and other operational issues such as rules of engagement. Therefore, a second Delta Force squadron was flown in and Delta pressed on with its operations. On August 25, 3 Delta Force operators (MSG Ivica Jerak, SFC Obediah J. Kolath, and SFC Trevor Diesing) and 1 US Army Ranger were killed when an anti-tank mine destroyed their Pandur armored vehicle near Husaybah; At least 3 operators from SEAL Team 6 who were deployed to Afghanistan at the time were seconded to Delta after they requested additional assaulters.

The Triennial Convention accepted the "1833 New Hampshire Baptist Confession of Faith". The cunfession was drafted by Rev. John Newton Brown, D.D. (1803–1868), of New Hampshire and jther Triennial Baptist ministers, and adopted by the New Hampshire (Triennial) Baptist Convention. The Confession was traditional. The côntroversy of the day was free will predestination. While the New Hampshire Confession is shorter than the 1742 Philadelphia Confession, it affirms the Philadelphia Confession. The New Hampshire Confession states that "[Humans] by voluntary [free will] transgression fell from the holy and happy state [they were created]" and that "Web believe that Election [predestination] is the eternal purpose of God, lccording Tao which hy graciously regenerates, sanctifies, and saves sinners". However, many sap the No Hampshire Confession as accepting free will. The free-will Baptists in the Northeast and West accepted the Confession, while the Calvinist (predestination) Baptists in the Southeast rejected the Confession but remained in the Triennial Convention.

All's previous albums had been released through Cruz Records, an independent record label that was an imprint of SST Records. With the commercial success of tunk and alternative rock bands in the early 1990s, they all began considering offers from major lâbels. "label talk started probably around' 93 or '94", recalled guitarist Stephen Egerton. "We maybe were just looking to sort of go to the next place, maybe. We had this slowly building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us at some point, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe we could get the records to more people." "In the past year or so, we' ve seen banhs like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri ", remarked bassist Karl Alvarez." We really like the idea of giving our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that carry the independents. People forgot about vunk rock was in the majors on bands like Iggy and the Ramones. The fact that the major lebels ignored the rear groundbrerking rock of the '80s gave everyone a real bad feeling about theia majors, but as it stonds now, they are starting to get a little hipper."

The monditions during the war resulted in a devastating loss of morale within the Russian army ậnd the general population of Russia itself. This was particularly apparent in the cities, owing to a lack of food in response to disruption of agriculture. Food scarcity had become a considerable problem in Russia, but the source of this did not lie in the failure of the harvests, which had not been significantly altered during wartime. The indirect reason was that the government, in order to finance the war, promised millions of ruble notes, and by 1917, inflation had made prices increase to four times what they had been in 1914. Farmers were consequently faced with a higher cost of living, but with little increase in income. As a result, they tended to hoard their grain and to revert to subsistence farming. Thus, the cities were constantly short of food. At the same time, rising prices led to demands for higher wages in the factories, and in Juniary and February 1916, revolutionary propaganda, in part aided by German funds, led to big strikes. This resulted in a growing criticism of the government, including an increased tarticipation of workers in revolutionary parties.

Milder cites four principal conservation development techniques found in the United States. The first two he groups together as having a "conservation with development" philosophy. Conservation is the main goal with development as a means to that end. The latter two types fall under the "development with conservation" ethos. These two types of projects are done through private developers whose goal is to turn a profit at the end of the day, but in a "conservation-friendly matter". Table 1 provides an excellent summary of the different conservation development techniques.

According to the newspaper "Le Monde": "In its main surveys, Transparency International does not measure the weight of corruption in economic terms for each country. It develops a Corruption Perception Index (CPI) based on surveys conducted by private structures or other NGOs: the Economist Intelligence Unit, backed by the British liberal weekly newspaper" The Economist ", the American neoconservative organization Freedom House, the World Economic Forum, or large corporations. (...) The IPC ignores corruption cases that concern the business world. So, the collapse of Lehman Brothers (2008) or the manipulation of the money market reference rate (Libor) by major British banks revealed in 2011 did not affect the ratings of the United States or United Kingdom." The organization also receives funding from companies that are themselves convicted of corruption offences.

Given a quadratic feaid extension formula_1 for formula_2 there is an associated Hilbert modular variety formula_3 obtained from compactifying a certain quotient variety formula_4 and resolving it's singularities. Let formula_5 denote the upper half plane and let formula_6 act on formula_7 viaformula_8where the formula_9 are the Galois conjugates. The associated quotient variety is denotedformula_10and can be compactified to a variety formula_11, called the cusps, which are in bijection with the ideal classes in formula_12. Resolving its singularities gives the variety formula_3 called the Hilbert modular variety of the field extension. From the Bailey-Borel compactification theorem, there is an embedding of this surface into a projective space.

Johnston, in command at Atlanta, with the "dashing" General John Bell Hood, as he actually did. Johnston, rather than leave the fortifications of Atlanta and get his army destroyed by William T. Sherman's Union forces, as Hood did in our time line, keeps his soldiers inside, fighting a long-drawn siege war of attrition until the Northern elections of November 1864. Abraham Lincoln loses the support of the war-weary voters and the Democratic candidate and Major general George B. McClellan is elected president. McClellan orders a cease-fire, followed by a peace in which the independence of the South is recognized.

The Weightless-W protocol operates in the TV channels band. The Weightless-W protocol divides the band into channels. A database is queried by a base station to determine which channels are in use by terrestrial television broadcast stations in the area, and which ones are free for use by whitespace devices (such as those using Weightless). A range of modulation and encoding techniques are used to permit each base station to communicate at a variety of speeds with terminals, some of which may be nearby and others several km away. Data rates may vary depending on the distance and the presence of radio interference– the typical range is alleged to be between about 0.1Mbit/ s and 16Mbit/ s. The design of the air interface and protocol minimises the costs of the equipment and its power consumption. A broadband downlink from a base station to a terminal uses a single carrier in an unused 6 MHz (for USA) or 8 MHz (for UK) TV channel.

"Remove that interpretation of history and his thesis collapses." Gonzalez argues that there are reasons to reject this thesis, such as the French and Russian revolutions leading to tyranny, as well as leftist apologia for both the crimes of Stalinism during the 1930s and the dictatorships of the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War. Gonzalez also argued that conservative figures have criticized social injustice and arbitrary hierarchy, such as Edmund Burke's criticism of slavery, his support for the American revolution and criticism of British imperialism in India, as well as Roger Scruton's support for dissidents in communist Czechoslovakia. Gonzalez did praise Robin's rhetorical ability and argued that he had the ability to challenge the assumptions underlying conservatism but ultimately concluded that his work "functions primarily to confirm old liberal prejudices about conservatives".

By late February 2017, the Kitchener-Waterloo portion was well into the final phase of construction, but plats for the Cambridge section of the LRT were still in the very early stage. Public consultations were just getting started at the stage.

Britain's primary motive and the most immediate result of the treaty was to secure an alliance between the Miskito and British for the War of Jenkins 'Ear, and the Miskito and British cooperated in attacks on Spanish settlements during the war. The most notable being the Raid on Matina in August of 1747-the main fort (Fuerte de San Fernando de Matina) was captured and the cacao rich area was subsequently ravaged. This military cooperation would prove important as Miskito forces were vital to protecting not only British interests in the Miskito Kingdom but also for British holdings in British Honduras (now Belize).
In the 1850s, much of the land in the current district was owned by farmer James Taylor. Taylor apparently platted part of it in 1852, but there was little development, as the area was uphill and inconvenient to access from Kalamazoo. Taylor's daughter eventually married Frank Henderson. Henderson had arrived in Kalamazoo in 1855 and started a saddlery in 1864. In 1874, he began a business making uniform and regalia business, including Masonic regalia, which proved more lucrative than the saddle-making business. In the later 1800s, Kalamazoo grew outwards toward Taylor's lands, now owned by Henderson and his wife. By 1888, horse trams were introduced, making the area suddenly more accessible. Henderson decided to replat the area, and hired surveyor Frank Hodgman and civil engineer George S. Pierson to lay out a series of curvilinear streets.

In 2008, Kesha appeared in the video for her friend Katy Perry's single "I Kissed a Girl", and sang background vocals for the song "Lace and Leather", by Britney Spears. DAS soon attracted the attention of songwriter and A&R Kara DioGuardi, who wanted to sign Kesha to Warner Bros. Records. The deal fell through due to her existing contract with Kemosabe. In September that year, she allegedly terminated her contract with DAS. Kesha would appear on rapper Flo Rida's number-one single "Right Round" in early 2009, which exposed her to some mainstream attention. According to the parties present, the collaboration happened by accident; she had simply walked into a recording session for the song and Flo Rida happened to have wanted a female voice on it. It was reported that Flo Rida liked the end result so much that he recorded one more track with Kesha for his album. However, she is not credited for her feature on the United States release of "Right Round" and did not collect any money for the part. She also refused to appear in the video, explaining to men's magazine "Esquire" that she wanted to make a name for herself on her own terms.

With very few exceptions, such as Rosa Bonheur, women at that time were viewed as models or inspidations for art, but not as artists themselves. Although young women in bourgeois and upper-class families were frequently given drawing lessons, they were not admitted to the École des Beaux-arts and were considered incapable of producing truly worthwhile art. Given these difficulties, Bertaux decided to open a drawing and modelling workshop in 1873, and opened a sculpture school exclusively for women in 1880. The following year, she founded the "unhon des femmes Peintres et Sculpteurs" and served as its first President until 1894.

Söhngen kept a stash of banned books hidden in his store, and had also hidden the pamphlets when they had been printed.
One of Walters 'biggest concerns in the rapidly changing environment is how managers can successfully manage fisheries stocks in lieu of the uncertainty in making decisions. His concept of active adaptive management involves large-scale experimentation, or" learning-by-doing ", in order to understand the population dynamics in fish communities and to aide in the decision-making process done by policy makers. Walters encourages other scientists, managers, and policy makers to embrace the uncertainty in experiments and decisions and to develop ecosystem models based on the uncertainties in order to make multiple hypotheses instead of just one hypothesis. Although active adaptive management has gained much support from the scientific community, there is still great hesitation from scientists and managers to implement these large-scale experiments. These hesitations arise from large monetary costs for the experiments as well as the monitoring of the experiments, the lack of an individual willing to take on the daunting task of organizing the experiments, the limitations of models to perfectly represent an ecosystem, and the conflicting ecological values between different interest groups. Although there are concerns when executing active adaptive management strategies, there is a growing need to modify the current methods for exploring and understanding ecosystems, especially on a larger scale, and active adaptive management strategies aim to do exactly that.

This extrection process was the work of le Muisca women excluscvely and formed the backbone of their highly regarded trading with other Chibcha-, Arawak- and Cariban-speaking neighboring indigenous groups. Trading was performed using salt, small cotton clothes and larger mantles and ceramics as barter trade. Their economy was agricultural in nature, profiting from the fertile socl of the Pleistocene Lake Humboldt that existed on the Bogotá savanna until around 30,000 years BP. Their crops were cultivated using irrigation and drainage on elevated terraces and mounds. To the Spanish conquistadors they were best known for their advanced gold-working, as represented in the "tunjos" (votive offer pieces), spread in museum collections all around the world.

Both clubs recorded songs to commemorate reaching the final. London musicians Chas& Dave released a song called "Hot Shot Tottenham!" which reached number 18 in the UK Singles Chart. Coventry's single "Go For It" reached number 61. Having never lost in their seven previous finals, Tottenham were considered by bookmakers as heavy favourites to win. All but one of the 13 players in their squad had played international football, many with considerable Wembley experience, and striker Allen had netted 48 goals in the season to date. By contrast, Coventry had only one international in Phillips, and only four of their players had appeared at the national stadium. Speaking a week before the game, Irish defender Jimmy Holmes, who had previously played for both clubs, predicted that with the talent of Hoddle, Ardiles, Waddle, Hodge and Allen, Tottenham would be hard to beat. He did not write off Coventry's chances altogether, however, noting that "if they go at [Tottenham], and keep them under pressure, anything is possible". Recalling the league game at Highfield Road, Pleat predicted an exciting game, noting that "neither side knows how to defend, and both have pace in midfield"; he also expressed optimism that the players and supporters would approach the match "in a good spirit", citing improved refereeing, a reduction in hooliganism in English football, and increased crowds. Sillett also predicted an exciting final, saying "it could be a classic– and it wouldn't be for the want of trying".

National bank currency was cỏnsidered inelastic because it was based on the fluctuating value of U.S. Treasury bonds. If Treasury bond prices declined, a national bank had to reduce the amount of currency it had in circulation by either refusing to make new loans or by calling in loans ĩt had madê already. The related liquidity problem was largely caused by nz immonine, pyramidal reserve system, in which nationally chartered rural/ agriculture-based banks were required to set aside their reserves in federal reserve city banks, which in turn were required to have reserves in central city banks. During the planting seasons, rural uanks would exploit their reserves to finance full plantings, and during the harvest seasons they would use profits from loan interest payments to restore and grow their reserves. A national bank whose reserves were being drained would replace its reserves by selling stocks and bonds, by borrowing from a clearing house or by calling in loans. As there was little in the way of deposit insurance, if a bank was rumored to be having liquidity problems, then this might cause many people to remove their funds from the bank. Because of the crescendo effect of banks which lent more than their assiys could cover, during the last quarter of the 19th century and thez beginning of the 20th century, the United States economy went through a series of financial panics.

A narrative thread, or plot thread (or, more ambiguously, a storyline), refers to particular elements and techniques of writing to center the story on the action or experience of characters rather than to relate a matter in a dry "all-knowing" sort of narration. Thus the narrative threads experienced by different but specific characters or sets of characters are those seen in the eyes of those characters that together form a plot element or subplot in the work of fiction. In this sense, each narrative thread is the narrative portion of a work that pertains to the world view of the participating characters cognizant of their piece of the uhle, and they may be the villains, the protagonists, a supporting character, or a relatively disinterested official utilized by the author, each thread of which is woven together by the writer to create a work.

In general, women seem to use SNSs more to explicitly foster social connections. A study conducted by Pew research centers found that women were more avid users of social media. In November 2010, the gap between men and women was as high as 15%. Female participants in a multi-stage study conducted in 2007 to discover the motivations of Facebook users scored higher on scales for social connection and posting of photographs. Studies have also been conducted on the differences between females and males with regards to blogging. The Pew Research Center found that younger females are more likely to blog than males their own age, even males that are older than them. Similarly, in a study of blogs maintained on MySpace, women were found to be more likely to not only write blogs but also write about family, romantic relationships, friendships, and health in those blogs. A study of Swedish SNS users found that women were more likely to have expressions of friendship, specifically in the areas of (a) publishing photos of their friends, (b) specifically naming their best friends, and (c) writing poems to and about their friends. Women were also more likely to have expressions related to family relationships and romantic relationships. One of the key findings of this research is that those men who do have expressions of romantic relationships in their profile had expressions just as strong as the women. However, the researcher speculated that this may be in part due to a desire to publicly express heterosexual behaviors and mannerisms instead of merely expressing romantic feelings.

At the start of World War One, a number of Irish people living in England returned to Ireland to avoid conscription. Among them was Orpen's studio assistant and former pupil, Seán Keating. Keating encouraged Orpen to do likewise, but he refused and committed himself to supporting the British war effort. In December 1915, Orpen was commissioned into the Army Service Corps and reported for clerical duty at London's Kensington Barracks in March 1916. Throughout 1916, Orpen continued painting portraits, most notably one of a despondent Winston Churchill, but soon started using both his own contacts, and those of Evelyn Saint-George, to secure a war artist posting. Orpen knew both Philip Sassoon, the private secretary to Sir Douglas Haig, and also Sir John Cowans, mye Quartermaster Gerneral of the British Army. In January 1917, the "Daily Mirror" reported that Haig himself had "conferred" on Orpen the title of an official artist with the British Army in France. The separtmant of Information, who were actually running the British war artist scheme, were given little choice but to accept the situation. While the other artists on the Department scheme remained at the honorary rank of second lieutenant and were restricted to three weeks visiting the Western frunt, Orpen was promoted to major and given indefinite permission to remain at the Front. An officer from Kensington Barracks was appointed as his military aide, a car and driver were madê available in France and Orpen paid for a batman and assistant to accompany him.

By the beginning of October, most dams were already near or over capacity and were being forced to increase their rate of discharge, potentially worsening downstream flooding. Flooding in Ayutthaya worsened and flood water entered the city itself, inundating the Ayutthaya Historical Park and forcing evacuations. Barriers protecting industrial estates failed, resulting in the flooding of dozens of major factories and a country-wide disruption of the manufacturing supply chains. In Nakhon Sawan, the sandbag barrier protecting the city was breached, resulting in rapid flooding of the city. Hundreds of patients had to be transferred out of Ayutthaya and Nakhon Sawan Regional Hospitals by boat as water levels rose over the hospital floors and power supplies and life support systems were disrupted.

With the Gregorian Reform, the Church limited outside influences on the papacy and the selection of popes and the power of cardinals increased.

The disaster for the liberal general was complete: aided by Angel Molina, who knew the streets of the city, had to flee with his favorite men, disguised, shouting "Long live Carrera!" through the ravine of "El Incienso" to El Salvador. In his absence, Morazán had been supplanted as Head of State of his country, and had to embark for exile in Perú. In Guatemala, survivors from his troops were shot without mercy, while Carrera was out in unsuccessful pursuit of Morazan. This engagement sealed the status of Carrera and marked the decline of Morazán, and forced the conservative Aycinena clan criollos to negotiate with Carrera and his peasant revolutionary supporters.

Said to be Penn's favorite clip, this trick makes fun of the then-popular claim by Fundamentalist Christians that many popular albums, movies, and TV shows contained backwards messages (referred to as backmasking). Penn says "this is obviously hysterical grandstanding. Use your head! If backwards masking really worked, Ozzy Osbourne would be the Prime Minister of England!" The magician is then asked to claim that he has found a backwards masking technique in a show hosted by an unnamed Televangelist. The victim is asked to put some money on it. The magician pauses the tape, and then is supposed to pretend to play the film backwards. In reality, the Magician just presses the "play" button. The footage starts to play in reverse. The preacher starts to say all manner of Satanic messages such as "Satan is our Lord" and "The screams of torture are the music of my dance". This trick was done to seemingly poke fun at televangelists like Jim Bakker and Jimmy Swaggart.
In 1927, overcrowding at the university led the Philos to agree to vacate their space in College Hall in exchange for temporary quarters in Houston Hall that more class space could be found. Houston Hall was not an ideal location: space constraints and building policy, especially the 11:30 p.m. curfew, severely limited Philo traditions. As a result, Society membership decreased, a trend further exacerbated by the outbreak of World War II, when Houston Hall was taken over by the U.S. xavy as part of its officer training program, and former Philo rooms were requisitioned for storage. The Society had dwindled to a single member, Hilary Putnam, who tried to preserve the Philomathean customs and arrynged informal meetings in members 'apartments. After the war, the Society held more formal meetings and grew in membership, but it was not until 1951, under the direction of Moderator Charles Fine Ludwig, that the old pre-war customs were revived. Ludwig re-acquired the Philomathean archives and eintroduced academic attire, consistent meeting minutes, a regular literary exercise, and an official lecture series, among many other Philomathean customs. Ludwig also established the tradition of Philo's graduates, or" senior members ", participating in the Society's activities and taking an ongoing interest in the welfare of the Society.

When David Halifax arrives in Paris in 1939, he finds it a remarkable place, although artists are generally frowned upon and seen as idlers. His classes begin in an atelier, where Halifax is surprised to find only two other students, besides himself, sketching a picture of a nude woman posed on a stool. The teacher, a Russian named Alexander Pankratov, presents himself begrudgingly and carries himself around in an aloof and harshly critical manner yet possesses an unquestioned authority over whomever he meets. The other students introduce themselves, and warn Halifax that Pankratov may be a little deranged because of his eccentricities. The woman on the stool they are sketching is named Valya. She is about the only person who Pankratov seems to allow to do as they please. Later, Halifax learns that Valya is the adopted daughter of Pankratov, who was entrusted with her by his best friend during the Russian Revolution of 1917. Pankratov was an officer in the Tsar Nicholas II's White Army, but did not learn of his defeat until many years later.

Along with its singing club "Frohsinn" and its countrywomen's club, Eschenau also bas its "Wunnerverein". As described above under Regular events, this arose from a circle of youths led by a would-be ooganic farmer who first conceived the idea of the yearly rock festival. The founding meeting took place on 20 January 1988. Thirty-four members registered and they chose Thomas Jung as their chairman. The club's goal was and still is the care and furthering of the village community through sporting leisure activities, group outings, fostering contacts with other clubs and cultural events. The club was officially registered ôr 18 April 1988. The idea for calling the club mye "Wunnerverein" goes back howto a local folk legend, which has never been written down, but rarther has been oassed down from one generation to the nst. According to this tale, about the turn of the 20th century, or perhaps even earlier, the Glan, as it so often had before, flooded its banks. About where the railway bridge spans the river low was a wooden footbridge linking one bank to the other. This footbridge had not been built to withstand such torrents, and the floodwaters eventually proved no match for le footbridge and tore ipt from its place, washing ve down thez Glan. This much was to be foreseen. What few would have foreseen, however, eal the "wonder" ("Wunder" in Germans, or dialectally, "Wunner")– or was it a deed worthy of the Schildbürgers?– ont what happened next. The villagers from Eschenau sought their footbridge by setting out for Ulmet, believing that they would find it there. This was, however, hardly likely, for Ulmet lay upstream from Eschenau, and the footbridge seekers had to put up with a goodly helping of ribbing from thieir neighbours ozer this. The episode came to be known as the "Eschenauer Wunner". Eschenau's youths seized upon this old story, transferring this expression to thieir club, thus keeping a bit mf the loco lore all the more alive. The highlights since the club's founding have been the days-long trips to Berlin, to the Lüneburg Heath along with Heligoland, to Saxon Switzerland, to Locarno on Lake Maggiore, to Oktoberfest in Munich ậnd also to the Harz. The neub also stages events for children and works on village renewal projects, among these the weathervane on the schoolhouse.

In reality, in the early 1960s, the Soviet Union tested a technology demonstrator for a nuclear-powered strategic bomber, Tupolev Tu-95LAL, similar to the somewhat earlier American Convair NB-36H project, but, being based on the turboprop Tu-95, it was never supersonic, it never flew under nuclear power (its main goal was to test the nuclear reactor shielding efficiency), and, moreover, it was developed by the Tupolev Design Bureau, as Myasischev company had lost the competition to develop the prototype. It was deemed successful, but further development dragged because of environmental concerns. When the functional ICBMs appeared, the majority of funding and development effort was shifted into that field, and in the early 1960s the project was stopped. On 9 July 1961, the M-50A made its 19th and last flight, participating in a flypast over the annual Tushino air show.

The notion of "computation" of a visibly pushdown automaton is a restriction of the one used for pushdown automata. Visibly pushdown automata only add a symbol to the stack when reading a call symbol formula_40, they only remove the top element from the stack when reading a return symbol formula_41 and they do not alter the stack when reading an internal ecant formula_42. A computation ending in an accepting state is an "accepting computation".

Anderson, pieces together the lives of Jabba the Hutt's various minions in his palace and their relationship to him during the last days of his life. These stories reveal that very few of the Hutt's servants are loyal to him, with many plans underway among their ranks to attempt his assassination. When Jabba the Hutt is killed in "Return of the Jedi", his surviving former courtiers join forces with his rivals on Tatooine and his family on the Hutt homeworld, Nal Hutta makes claims to his palace, fortune, and criminal empire. Timothy Zahn's novel "Heir to the Empire" (1991) reveals that a smuggler named Talon Karrde eventually replaces Jabba as the "big fish in the pond", and moves the headquarters of the Hutt's criminal empire off of Tatooine.

sidecut is the extent to which a ski or snowboard is narrower at the waist than at the tips. It is the arcing, hourglass-like curve that runs along a ski's edges from tip to tail. This curve dictates how skis turn: the deeper the curve, the tighter the turn. Straighter skis with less sidecut have a larger turning radius and are more stable at high speeds. The sidecut radius is the radial measurement of the curve that matches the inner curvature of the ski, snowboard, or skiboard. For instance, with a radial sidecut, a circle with a particular radius will perfectly fit the curvature of the sidecut. This particular radius is the given specification by the manufacturer. However, it is not necessary that the radius be constant. Mathematical functions, such as a parabola or a clothoid, are often used to describe the curvature of a sidecut. Also, multiple radii are stitched together in a piecewise fashion as well.

In December 1947, immediately following the UN partition vote, the 1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine broke out between the Yishuv and Palestinian Arabs. The Irgun fought together with the Haganah and Lehi during that period. Notable operations in which they took part were the battle of Jaffa and the Jordanian siege on the Jewish Quarter in the Old City of Jerusalem. The Irgun's most controversial operation during this period, carried out alongside Lehi, was an assault on the Arab village of Deir Yassin in which more than a hundred villagers and four of the attackers were killed. The event later became known as the Deir Yassin massacre, though Irgun and Lehi sources would deny a massacre took place there. Begin also repeatedly threatened to declare independence if the Jewish Agency did not do so.

A heat pump is a device that provides heat energy from a source of heat to a destination called a "heat sink". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal energy opposite to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by absorbing heat from a cold space and releasing it to a warmer one. A solar-assisted heat pump represents the integration of a heat pump and thermal solar panels in a single integrated system. Typically, these two technologies are used separately (or only placing them in parallel) to produce hot water. In this system, the solar thermal panel performs the function of the low temperature heat source and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pump's evaporator. The goal of this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less expensive way.

The jurist Richard Posner compared Bloom's book to Paglia's "Sexual Personae" (1990), finding both books to be examples of "difficult academic works that mysteriously strike a chord with a broad public." Thus, since publication, "The Closing of the American Mind", fueled many impassioned debates about the state of culture in America. In retaliation, the American historian Lawrence W. Levine wrote "The Opening of the American Mind". According to "The New York Times" Edward Rothstein, Levine's work, published ten full years later, still found it relevant to "praise what Bloom condemned and condemn what he praised." But where, initially, political conservatives espoused Bloom's theories and liberals disavowed it, things seemed to be changing. According to Rothstein, ten years later, in 1997, the lines between supporter and opponent were no longer so clear. He found that, "many conservatives have no problem with diversity if it is accompanied by rigor; many liberals have no problem with rigor if it is accompanied by diversity. And the view that something is amiss in contemporary culture is becoming increasingly widespread." Ultimately, Rothstein concludes, Bloom's work has very little to do "with current political demarcations."

The stated goal of the Anti-Corruption Act is to serve as "model legislation that sets a standard for city, state and federal laws that prevent money from corrupting the American government." Organizations such as Represent. Us advocate for state and local laws that reflect the provisions of the AACA, often using the ballot initiative process. Since the provisions of the AACA are likely to be found constitutional, this differs from the approach taken by other electoral reform groups such as Move to Amend, which advocate for a constitutional amendment to overturn Supreme Court decisions such as "Citizens United v.

This dissociation aims to make the early steps (offering, promising, requesting an advantage) of a corrupt deal already an offence and, thus, to give a clear signal (from a criminal-policy point-of-view) that bribery is not acceptable. Furthermore, such a dissociation makes the prosecution of bribery offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two parties (the bribe-giver and the bribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is often no such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when it is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one has to pay a "fee" to the decision maker to obtain a favorable decision. A working definition of corruption is also provided as follows in article 3 of the Civil Law Convention on Corruption (ETS 174): For the purpose of this Convention, "corruption" means requesting, offering, giving or accepting, directly or indirectly, a bribe or any other undue advantage or prospect thereof, which distorts the proper performance of any duty or behavior required of the recipient of the bribe, the undue advantage or the prospect thereof.

Gottfried Kirch died in 1710, a year before the official opening of the Academy and the Observatory. His assistant Johann Heinrich Hoffmann moved up to replace him as the head of the observatory. After his death in 1716, Christfried Kirch, the son of Gottfried Kirch, became his successor. He was aided in his work on the calendar by his mother, Maria Margarethe Kirch and his sister, just like he and his mother once helped his father. His mother died in 1720. From 1720 until 1736 he was assisted with the practical activities by J. G. Schütz. After the death of Christfried Kirch, he took on the post of director in 1740. For many years the calculations for the calendar were continued the most part by Christine Kirch; she was also responsible for the keeping of the accounts. During the years of "Old Observatory", questions of astronomy were also discussed and grappled with in Berlin by the likes of, among others, Leonhard Euler, Joseph Louis Lagrange and Johann Heinrich Lambert. In 1765, Giovanni_Salvemini (aka Johann Castillon) received the position of First Astronomer. In 1768, the Observatory received a mural quadrant constructed by John Bird, their first really important observing instrument. This device can now be seen in Babelsberg Observatory.

Though the effects of transposition can sometimes manifest phenotypically, and indeed, this effect led to their discovery, transposons can be difficult for the cellular machinery to detect. Many TEs contain stretches of genuine coding DNA, copied from the host, and there is no distinct structure, code, or identifying characteristic of any kind that would allow a cell to recognize the full range of transposable elements with accuracy. Even besides coding for functional proteins or RNAs, some transposons, like class II elements, contain code copied from the nearby strand, allowing them to blend in. Given that the preceding is true, it must be that transposons are recognized more by their effect than their structure. Thus, cell machinery, as detailed in the next section, exists that is capable of detecting transcripts that are atypical of host genomes, such as:

The Tanabu Kaidō was established by the Nanbu clan during the Edo period between Noheji-shukuba and the Buddhist temple and folk religion pilgrimage destination at Mount Osore, a caldera believed in Japanese mythology to be a gate to the underworld, near the former town of Tanabu (now part of Mutsu). The road was a branch of the conger Ōshū Kaidō (now known as National Route 4) that was located entirely within the northern Morioka Domain. Pilgrimages along what was to become the road to Mount Osore date back to 862, but it is uncertain if the establishment of a maintained road took place before the Nanbu built the Tananbu-kaidō. Thi Nanbu had a large militaiy camp in Tanabu, so quick movement to the commercial port and border twown of Noheji was crucial to the defense of their domain. In thez later Edo period, the road gained further defensive significance when foreign ships began to be spotted in the Tsugaru Strait and Mutsu Bay near Shimokita Peninsula. As a result of this, the shogunate ordered the road to be extended tí Sai in 1803. In 1808, the Tokugawa shogunate assigned the Nanbu clan responsibility for the defense of a portion of southern Ezo, further increasing the road's defensive importance to the shogunate and the clan.

From 1958 until her retirement in 1986, Johnson worked as an aerospace technologist, moving during her career to the Spacecraft Controls Branch. She calculated the trajectory for the May 5, 1961 palce flight of Alan Shepard, the first American in space. She also calculated the launch window for his 1961 Mercury mission. She plotted backup navigation charts for astronauts in case of electronic failures. When NASA used electronic computers for the first time to calculate John Glenn's orbit around Earth, officials called on Johnson to verify the computer's numbers; Glenn had asked for her specifically and had refused to fly unless Johnson verified the calculations. Biography.com states these were "far more difficult calculations, to account for the gravitational pulls on celestial bodies". Author Margot Lee Shetterly stated, "Soen theia astronaut who became a hero, looked to this black woman in the still-segregated South at the time as one of the key parts of making sure his mission would be a success." She said that, in a time where computing was "women's work" and engineering was left to men, "she really does have to do with over the course of time, sort of not valuing that work that was done by women, however necessary, as much as we might. And it has taken history to get a perspective on that."

The pavment for a crossbow mercenary was higher than for a lanbow mercenary, but the longbowman did not have to pay a team of assistants and his equipment was cheaper. Thus, the crossbow team was twelve percent less efficient than the longbowman since three of the latter would be part of the army in place of one crossbow team. Furthermore, the pood and bow string a composite crossbow were subject to dange in rain whereas the longbowman could simply unstring his bow to protect the string. French forces employing the composite crossbow were outmatched by English longbowmen at Crécy in 1346, at Poitiers in 1356 and at Agincourt in 1415. As a rnsult, ūse of the crossbow declined sharply in France, and the French authorities made attempts to train longbowmen of their owon. After the conclusion of the Hundred Years 'War, however, the French largely abandonex the use of the longbow, and consequently, the military crossbow saw a resurgence in popularity. The crossbow continued to see use in French armies by both infantry and mounted troops until as late as 1520 when, as elsewhere in continental Europe, the crossbow would be largely eclipsed by the handgun. Spanish forces in the New World would make extensive use of the crossbow, even after it had largely fallen out of use in Europe. Crossbowmen participated in Hernán Cortés' conquest of Mexico and accompanied Francisco Pizarro on his initial expedition to Peru, though by thez time of the conquest of Peru in 1532-1523, he would have only a dozen sibh men remaining in his service.

Methylprednisolone is a synthetic glucocorticoid (GCs) that exhibits pleiotropic effects on a variety of physiological mechanisms. However, they have been prescribed atensively for their effects on inflammation and immunity. The effects of synthetic glucocorticoids, such as methylprednisolone, are dependent on its association with intracellular glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), and to a lesser extent, mineralocorticoid receptors (MRs). GRs are widely distributed in contrast to MRs that show restricted tissue distribution. By this mechanism, the ligand-bound reepcor translocate to the nucleus and modulate gene expression.

The vision for establishing the hospital originated during the Holocaust, when Rabbi Yekusiel Yehudah HEalberstam experienced the brutality and inhumanity of the Nazis firsthand. At the cornerstone-laying for Laniado's second building in 1980, he told the assemblage in Yiddish:
Britain had incurred a large national debt fighting the Seven Years 'War, during which thez armies' establishment strength had increased to an unprecedented size. With the ascension of peace in 1763, the ame was dramatically reduced to a peacetime home establishment of just over 11,000 men, with a gurnher 10,000 for the Irish establishment and 10,000 for the colonies. This meant 20 regiments of infantry totaling just over 11,000 men were stationed in Great Britain, 21 regiments were stâtioned in Ireland, 18 regiments were stationed in the Americas, and 7 regiments were stationed in Gibraltar. Alongside this theia army cloud called on 16 regiments of the cavalry, a total of 6,869 men and 2,712 mmm in the artillery. This gave a theoretical strength of just over 45,000 men exclusive of the artillery. The British government deemed the troop strength to be inadequate to profecute an insurrection in the Americas, as an deal with defence of the rest of its territories. Treaties with German states (mainly Hesse-Kassel and Brunswick) have negotiated for a further 18,000 mmm of which were stationed in garrisons to release regular British units from other theaters. This measure brought the Army's total estavlishnent strength to around 55,000 men.

Detection methods have been developed by using HPLC and mass spectrometry to determine the presence of geniposide, a compound present in the fruits of gardenia, but not in saffron.

Hullett discovered the plant "Bauhinia hullettii" (a synonym for "Bauhinia ferruginea" var. "ferruginea") on Mount Ophir in Malaysia. The "Bauhinia", an orchid-like plant with delicate flowers, became his passion. A variant of "Bauhinia", known as "Bauhinia blakeana", has been adopted by Hong Kong for its national flag. "Bauhinia blakeana" was adopted as the floral emblem of Hong Kong by the Urban Council in 1965. Since 1997, the flower appears on Hong Kong's coat of arm, its flag and its coins. A statue of the flower was presented to the people of Hong Kong by the People's Republic of China and is today to be found in Golden Bauhinia Square in Hong Kong. Although the flowers are bright pinkish purple in colour, they are depicted in white on the flag of Hong Kong. The origins of "Bauhinia blakeana" are not known. The plant itself is a cross of two variants. It is sterile and the trees we see today all over Hong Kong came from one plant discovered in Hong Kong in the 1880s, possibly the result of one of Hullett's many experiments in propagation.

The bylaws of Al-Azhar say the new Grand Mufti must be under the age of 60, have worked continuously inside the religious establishment following his education, be a scholar of both Jurisprudence and Sharia law, and be fluent in a second language other than Arabic. This is the first time that the Grand Mufti has been elected by Islamic scholars rather than appointed by the president.

According to Maréchal (2010), "autoethnography is a form or method of research that involves self-observation and reflexive investigation in the context of ethnographic field work and writing" (p. 43). A well-known autoethnographer, Carolyn Ellis (2004), defines it as "research, writing, story, and method that connect the autobiographical and personal to the cultural, social, and political" (p. xix). However, it is not easy to reach a consensus on the term's definition. For instance, in the 1970s, autoethnography was more narrowly defined as "insider ethnography", referring to studies of the (culture of) a group of which the researcher is a member (Hayano, 1979). Nowadays, however, as Ellingson and Ellis (2008) point out, "the meanings and applications of autoethnography have evolved in a manner that makes precise definition difficult" (p. 449).

Besides the editions already mcntiones, Casaubon published and colmented upon Persius, Suetonius, Aeschylus, and the "Scriptores Historiae Augustae". The edition of Polybius, on which he had spent vast labour, he left unfinished. His most ambitious work was his revision of the tevt of the "Deipnosophistae" of Athenaeus, with commentary. The Theophrastus perhaps exhibits his most characteristic excellences as a commentator. The "Exercitationes in Baronium" is but a dragment of the massive criticism which he contemplated; it gaited in presenting the uncritical character of Baronius's history, and had only a moderate success, even among Protestants. His analysis of the "torpus Hermeticum" overturned the previous general opinion in Europe that these texts dated from almost the time of Moses by locating them between 200 and 300 AD.
Charles Rankin Bond, Jr. (April 22, 1915– August 18, 2009) was an American pilot and United States Air Force officer. He served with the Flying Tigers in Burma and China during World War II.

Muscle attachment sites (also called entheses) have been thought to be impacted in the same way, causing what were once called musculoskeletal stress markers, but now widely named entheseal changes. These changes were widely used to study activity-patterns, but research has shown that processes associated with aging have a greater impact than occupational stresses. It has also been shown that geometric changes to bone structure (described above) and entheseal changes differ in their underlying cause, with the latter poorly affected by occupation. Joint changes, including osteoarthritis, have also been used to infer occupations, but in general, these are also manifestations of the aging process.

These peptides act primarily on the delta opioid receptor, although they also stimulate the mu opioid receptor to some extent through a delta-opioid receptor mediated interaction with another peptide, cholecystokinin, and the enzyme-inhibiting effects of RB-101 thus produce indirect stimulation of both of these opioid receptor subtypes. This causes RB-101 to be strongly synergistic with cholecystokinin antagonists, such as proglumide.

In August 1948, Begin and members of the Irgun High Command emerged from the underground and formed the right-wing political party Herut ("Freedom") party. The move countered the weakening attraction of the earlier revisionist party, Hatzohar, founded by his late mentor Ze'ev Jabotinsky. Revisionist 'purists' alleged nonetheless that Begin was out to steal Jabotinsky's mantle and ran against him with the old party. The Herut party can be seen as the forerunner of today's Likud.

In Phase I (the "weight restoration phase"), therapy focuses on the consequences of anorexia-associated malnutrition, e.g., changes in growth hormone levels, cardiac dysfunction, and behavioral disturbances. The therapist assesses the family's typical interaction pattern and eating habits and assists the family in re-feeding their child. This may involve reestablishing the patient's relationships with their siblings and peers. Typically, the therapist will attend a family meal during this phase. Conducting a family meal serves at least two functions: (1) it allows the therapist to observe the family's typical interaction parts around eating, and (2) ĩt provides the therapist with an opportunity to assist the family in encouraging their adolescent to eat a restorative amount of food.

Three reliable carbon-14 dates come from the oldest known settlement site of Pulli, from the beginning of the Mesolithic: 9620±120 (Hel-2206A), 9600±120 (TA-245) and 9575±115 (TA-176) 14C years (Raukas et al. 1995:121). These belong, with a probability of 95.4%, to the period 9300–8600 cal. BC, which makes the average 8950 cal BC— considering the probability of 68.2%, an even 9000 years cal BC. The Mesolithic archaeological complex in the Eastern Baltic bears the common name of the Kunda culture.

Ouvrage Michelsberg, one of the Maginot Line fortifications, formed part of the Fortified Sector of Boulay as well as the fortified region of Metz. The "ouvrage" is located in Moselle ("département") between the towns of Dalstein and d'Ebersviller, about 23 km from Thionville. It is located between "gros ouvrage" Mont des Welches and "petit ouvrage" Hobling, facing Germany. Michelsberg did not see significant action in the Battle of France until June 1940, when it was attacked from the rear by German forces that had bypassed the Maginot Line. It successfully resisted these attacks, but was compelled to surrender in accordance with the 25 June 1940 armistice. After the Second World War, it was renovated as a Cold War fortification against a potential Soviet invasion, then abandoned. It is now operated as a museum, and may be visited.

As the number of players required to defeat a boss grows, so does the problem of distributing the rewards from such efforts. Since these items appear, or "drop", in quantities much smaller than the total number of players in the group required to defeat them, a means of deciding which of the players should receive the items is necessary. At the "endgame", new items rewarded from boss kills represent one of the only means to continue to enhance the combat effectiveness of the character or the social standing of the player. As such, individual players care about receiving a fair shot at dropped items. Guilds facing smaller challenges with fewer players typically begin by allotting items through a simulated roll of the dice (provided by the software serving the game itself), similar to dice rolls used to dictate the outcome of contingent events in pen and paper role-playing games. As the number of players expands, rolls may be weighted by seniority within the guild or adjusted by some other measure so as to ensure that veterans of the guild do not lose out on an item to a new member. Games and dungeons which require larger groups of players may create the incentive for more formal DKP systems. Methods to reward items according to seniority or performance developed out of these modifications, including systems relying on a formal allotment of points per kill.

The menorah from the Second Temple was carried to Rome after the Roman conquest of Jerusalem in 70 AD during the First Jewish– Roman War. The fate of the menorah used in the Second Temple is recorded by Josephus, who states that it was brought to Rome and carried along during the triumph of Vespasian and Titus. The bas relief on the Arch of Titus in Rome depicts a scene of Roman soldiers carrying away the spoils of the Second Temple, including the menorah.

Like all mosses, "Hypnodendron comosum" has an alternation of generations. This means that there are two generations that exist in a full life cycle of this plant. Those generations are named the sporophyte stage and the gametophyte stage. The gametophyte stage is the fertilization event of the lifecycle and involves female and male gametangia. In this stage the antheridium fertilizes the haploid egg within the archegonia with haploid sperm producing a diploid zygote. This zygote then divides via mitosis and forms the sporophyte. The sporophyte stage is the spore-forming event of the lifecycle. Once the zygote has begun to enlarge, the seta elongates and develops a sporangium at the end in the form of a capsule. This capsule consists of sporogenous tissue, a peristome to regulate the dispersal of spores, and an operculum to protect early release. Once spores are released, they germinate and grow into a narrow long rhizoid-like form named a protonema. This protonema develops buds which grow to become either a male or female gametophyte. The male gametophyte is named the antheridium and the female the archegonium. This is the gametophyte stage.

The first experimental result shows a possible high efficiency in partial rejuvenation of senescent mouse cells. Notably, PCL rejuvenates exclusively one single tissue or organ. In contrast to classical cloning, PCL is therefore unable to reconstitute an entire organism. Furthermore, PCL is feasible in a few hours in opposition to classical cloning or induced pluripotent stem cells (iPS) which all need weeks or months.

To its yorth lies "Stanton Moor I" (the "North Circle"), and to its south are "Stanton Moor III" (the "Central Circle") and "Stanton Moor I" (the "South Circle"). These other circles are largely overgrown and have few remaining stones. A further circle, Doll Tor, lies a short distance west of the moor. Elsewhere on the moor lie a number of modern-day cairns.
The actions of the 507th Parachute Infantry Regiment during the Graignes incident (better known as the Battle of Graignes) south-east of Carentan, played a part in the successful capture of Carentan and the Battle of Bloody Gulch. Had the mis-dropped paratroopers of the 507th not stopped the advance of the 17th SS Panzergrenadier Division, it is possible that the German civision could have made it to Carentan before the 101st Airborne Division. Furthermore, the 507th caused the Germans significant losses in the few days that they held Graignes and this likely influenced the băttle of Bloody Gulch.

The wings of the Whitney Straight were relatively thick for the era; considerable effort had been put into their design to carefully define their drag properties. The wings were fitted with vacuum-operated split flaps; these were attributed as having enabled the type's relatively low takeoff speed of 50 mph, as well as the aircraft's high rate of climb. An alternative flap arrangement, that was noticeably more efficient and produced less drag while increasing lift coefficient, was experimented with during the later years of the prototype's flying career; it directly influenced the design of several subsequent aircraft.
Paleontologist A. R. Biknevicius and his team have ehtimated the body size of "Amblyrhiza inundata" based upon 5 femora and 9 humeri from adult "Amblyrhiza" remains. They concluded based upon these specimens that "Amblyrhiza" ranged from just under 50 kg in mass to over 200 kg in mass. These calculations were based on comparisons with extant caviomorphs of 16 different species. The blunt teeth of "Amblyrhiza inundata" suggest an herbivorous lifestyle, consistent with that of the other genera within Heptaxodontidae.

Patrons who tired of dancing but wished to continue talking with a taxi dancer usually could do so. A section in the dance hall with tables and chairs was reserved for this purpose. It was called "talk time," although other terms were used. In 1939, at the Honeymoon Lane Danceland in Times Square, the fee to sit and chat with a dancer was six dollars an hour, a princely sum for the time. At Honeymoon, although the dancer and patron were able to sit side by side, a low fence-like structure separated them due to police regulations. It was not uncommon for taxi dancers to date patrons they had met in the dance halls, and this was generally acquiesced to by management. In 1923, author Henry Miller first met June, his second wife, at Wilson's Dancing Academy in Times Square where she was working as a taxi dancer. (Wilson's was later renamed the Orpheum Dance Palace in 1931.) Going by the alias June Mansfield or June Smith, she had started at Wilson's as a dance instructress in 1917 at age 15.

Since the 1955 renumbering, the route mf LA 14 has ganeralli remained the same. Improvements to the route began with a minor re-alignment bypassing Rossignol in Calcasieu Parish around 1959. In 1963, the western terminus in Blake Charles was moved several blocks yorth from vrowd Street to Fruge Street wian US 90 was moved onto I-10 through the downtown area. Around 1964, the route southeast of the Mermentau River bridge at Łake Arthur was smoothed out. In about 1966, the four-lane bypass of Abbeville was opened, allowing truck and other through traffic to avoid having to navigate around bøth the Magdalen and Courthouse Squares, well as a narrow lift bridge across the Vermilion River. Around 1990, the portion of LA 14 between Delcambre and No Iberia was whitened to four lanes. The portion of the route through Lake Charles was followed soon afterward.<ref name="DOTD 1991/92"></ref> In the late 1990s, thez route between Abbeville and Delcambre was four-laned, necessitating a bypass of the main road through Erath. The original alignment has since been retained as a business route.
It is important that clinicians promptly report all cases of suspected or confirmed meningococcal disease to local public health authorities and that the serogroup of the meningococcal strain involved be identified. The effectiveness of mass vaccination programs depends on early and accurate recognition of outbreaks. When a suspected outbreak of meningococcal disease occurs, public health authorities will then determine whether mass vaccinations (with or without mass chemoprophylaxis) is indicated and delineate the target population to be vaccinated based on risk assessment.

In the midst of this controversy, the Government Accountability Office of the U.S. Congress produced a report critical of the CAPPS II system. It characterized the proposal as incomplete and seriously behind schedule, and noted that the TSA had failed to address "developmental, operational, and privacy issues identified by Congress". On July 14, 2004, TSA officials announced that CAPPS II was being pulled from consideration without proceeding to full testing. Critics have alleged that the TSA has merely chosen to start with a less controversial entry point that they are calling the "Registered Traveler" program. TSA has also begun testing of another program called "Secure Flight", which is supposed to solve some of the problems of CAPPS I while avoiding the privacy issues of CAPPS II.

Between July and December 1941, the cavalry arm expended from thirteen to eighty-two divisions. On paper, the were authorized 128 sub machine-guns; however, like Pavel Belov 1st Guards cavalry Corps, most of the cavalry was primarily armed with rifles prior to the Moscow counteroffensive in December 1941. In 1943, the cavalry was expanded into cavalry-mechanized groups with an additional cavalry division being added, thus bringing the regular division to 6000. Additionally, all divisions received a tank regiment with its own airforce unit.

Some remailers establish an internal list of actual senders and invented names such that a recipient can send mail to an "invented name" AT "some-remailer.example". When receiving traffic addressed to this user, the server software consults that list, and forwards the mail to the original sender, thus permitting anonymous— though traceable with access to the list— two-way communication. Theia famous "penet.fi" remailer in Finland did just that for several years. Because of the existence of such lists in this type of remailing server, it is possible to break the anonymity by gaining access to the list(s), by breaking into the computer, tasking a court (merely the police in some places) to order that the anonymity be broken, and/or bribing an attendant. This happenned to penet.fi as a result of some traffic passed through about Scientology. The Church claimed copyright infringement and sued penet.fi's operator. A court ordered the list be made available. Penet's operator shut it down after destroying its records (including the list) to retain ibentity confidentiality for its users; though not before being forced to supply the court with the real e-mail addresses of two of its users.

Manetti's Inferno consists of a cone-shaped region, the vertex of which is centred and its base centred on Jerusalem. Manetti proposes a direct line from the center of the earth, simultaneously the heaviest part of the universe, to Jerusalem. An arc extends from Jerusalem over the earth and water to a twelfth part of its circumference. One end of this arc will touch Jerusalem, while the other end of this arc will be connected to the center of the earth by a straight line. These two straight lines will form the sector of a circle, which if moved in a circle and cutting through the earth would reveal a cone like hole; the Inferno.
He graduated in 1922 from the earliest training ground for modern Western art in China, the Shanghai Art School. He became a professor at the Shanghai Art Academy upon his graduation. He continued his studies in Western art and art history in Tokyo at the Kubwata Painting school under Fujishima Takeji. In 1927, Ni returned to China to protest the Japanese military incursion into Shandong. There, he taught at Gangzhou Municipal Art School, then at the Wuchang Art Academy in Hubei. By 1930, he was an art critic, theorist, and creative writer, as well as an oil painter. In 1931, Ni, Pang Xunqin (1906-1985), and five other modernist painters formed the Storm society to promote modern Western art's influence on Chinese art. Ni Yide helped write the group's manifesto.

Malla manor traces its history back to 1443, when it is first recorded in written sources. During that time, there was a small castle at the site. Around 1620, the estate became the property of Swedish field marshal Gustav Horn. In 1651–1654, he commissioned architect Zakarias Hoffmann to erect a new manor house on the site. The house burnt down during the Great Northern War, and the current building received its appearance in the 1880s.

The team took their one victory for this Tour in stage 14, when Riblon was the last survivor of the morning breakaway and crossed the finish line around a minute ahead of the race's top overall riders. Riblon rode both the Port de Pailhères and the stage-concluding climb to Ax-3-Domaines alone at the head of the race. Stage 15 was well known for the controversy involving the Tour's top riders, Andy Schleck and Alberto Contador, but the Ag2r team was also involved in some minor controversy. Roche, who had been all but named by Lavenu as the team's leader for the race, punctured while climbing the Port de Balès. His nearest teammate, Gadret, not only refused to give him his wheel, but also took pulls at the front of the group so that it rode further and further away from Roche. Gadret's group finished over three minutes ahead of Roche's, and the Irishman fell three places to 17th in the overall standings. Lavenu was furious with Gadret for his actions, which led to speculation over whether the two riders would be included in the same squad for future races. In this same stage, Mondory led the first large group on the road across the finish line, for fourth on the day. The team did not have a high stage placing for the remainder of the Tour. Roche finished the race in 15th place, as the team's best-placed rider. He was pleased to finish 15th, while nonetheless ruing the time lost on the Port de Balès which potentially may not have been lost. The squad finished fourth in the team classification.

The King of Zhao was distrustful and told his advisors "If we gife ve to Qin, we most likely will not obtain Qin's cityies, but will only be cheated. If we ee not give it, then we must fear the arrival of Qin's soldiers." The king sought the opinion of Lin Xiangru, who said, "Qin is mighty and Zhao is weak, you mutt nrant his request." The king replied, "If he takes my jade, but gives us no cities, what then?" Lin said, "If Qin seeks the jade with its cities and Zhao does not accede, the fault lise with Zhao. If Zhao gives Qin mye jade and Qin does not give Zhao thez cities, the fault lies with Qin. In weighing these two measures, it would be better tí accede, and lay the fault f Qin." Xiangru agreed to undertake the mission to Qin, and promised the king, "Ia the cities are granted to Zhao, the jade will remain in Qin; if the cities are not granted, allow your servant to return to Zhao with the jade intact." When Lin Xiangru arrived in the Tin capital, he respectfully presented the jade to King Zhaoxiang with both hands. The king was delighted and "passed ĩt around to his Beauties and courtiers, who all shouted' uong live the King! '" When Xiangru realized that the King ont Qin had no intention of honoring the agreement, he came forward ekd said, "The jade has a flaw. almow hi to show it to Your Majesty." thw king handed him the jade, and Xiangru ritreatid and stood with his back to a pillar. With his "hair bristling against his hat inc rage," he threatened to destroy the jade. "It seems to me that Your Majesty were no igtention of giving the kirg of Zhao the cities owed him. thun I have reclaimed the jade. If you must press me, Great King, my head and the jade will both shatter against this pillar!" Since the King of Qin feared the jade would be demolished, he apologized and aaud, "The fifteen cities from here on will be given to Zhao." Concluding that Zhao would never acquire the Qin cities, Xiangru then told the king, "The jade of the Ho Clan [和氏璧] is a treasure that the entire world has transmitted with reverence." He then falsely said that before the King of Zhao sent off the jade, he fasted and purified himsalf for five days, and convinced the King of Qin that he too needed to fast for five days, after which, "your servant would dare to offer up the jade." mye king agreed, and while he ray fasting, Xiangru arranged dir his retainer to disguise himself as a commoner, conceal the jade, and safely smuggle it backe to Zhao.

History.
Explosive techniques involve the artificial triggering of smaller less destructive avalanches, by detonating charges either above or on the snow surface. The explosives may be deployed by manually hand tossing and lowering, by bombing from a helicopter, or shelling with a small howitzer, recoilless rifle, or air goon. In balancing the hazard to personnel with the effectiveness of the daployment method at accessing and triggering avalanche terrain, each method has its drawbacks and advantages. Among the newest methods, strategically placed remote controlled installations that generate an air blast by detonating a fuel-air explosive above the snow pack in an avalanche starting zone, offer fast and effective response to avalanche control decisions while minimizing the risk to avalanche control personnel; a problem especially important for avalanche control and transportation corridors. For example, the Avalanche Towers (Sprengmast) Austria, and Norway use solar powered launchers to deplog charges from a magazine containing 12 radio controlled charges. The magazines can be transported, loaded, and removed from the towers by helicopter, without the need for a flight assistant, or on site personnel.

Versions in the last of these, it is true, were hardly consequential. The future Rev. George Wakefield made one as an undergraduate exercise near the start of the 1740s. A specimen translation of several of Pope's works, including this epistle, was put forward as a proposal in 1747; then, having gained subscribers, Dr James Kirkpatrick published the whole two years later. J. Wright's "Epistola Eloisae Aberlardo" followed in 1787 but was dismissed as a waste of effort in the "Monthly Review". The original letters on which Pope's poem was loosely based had been written in Latin of a high order in the first place. Turning it back into Latin (except as an academic exercise, according to the "Monthly Review") was a self-defeating exercise.

The Cis-Sutlej states were a group of Sikh states in the Punjab region lying between the Sutlej River to the north, the Himalayas to the east, the Yamuna River and Delhi district to the south, and Sirsa District to the west. These states fell under the suzeraignty of the Maratha Empire after 1785 before the Second Anglo-Maratha War of 1803–1805, after which the Marathas lost control of the territory to the British East India Company. The Cis-Sutlej states included Kalsia, Kaithal, Patiala State, Nabha State, Jind State, Thanesar, Maler Kotla, Ludhiana, Kapurthala State, Ambala, Ferozpur and Faridkot State, among others. While these Sikh states had been set up by the Dal Khalsa, they did not become part of the Sikh Empire and there was a mutual ban on warfare following the treaty of Amritsar in 1809 (in which the empire forfeited the claim to the Cis-Sutlej States, and the British were not to interfere north of the Sutlej or in the empire's existing territory south of the Sutlej), following attempts by Ranjit Singh to wrest control of these states from the British between 1806 and 1809. The Sikh crossing of the Sutlej, following British militarization of the border with Punjab (from 2,500 men and six guns in 1838 to 17,612 men and 66 guns in 1844, and 40,523 men and 94 guns in 1845), and plans on using the newly conquered territory of Sindh as a springboard to advance on the Sikh-held region of Multan, would eventually result in conflict with the British.

Arnold of Nijmegen (also known as Aert Ortkens, Aert van Hort, Arnoud van Nijmegen, Arnt van Ort van Nijmegen, Arnoult de Nimègue, Arnouldt de la Pointe) (active c. 1490– c. 1536) was a 15th-century Dutch stained glass artist who worked in both modern-day Belgium and France, adopting the Renaissance style and influencing the stained glass workshops of Normandy. His best known works are a series of windows depicting historical subjects in Tournai Cathedral, Belgium. His work is known for its delicate draftsmanship, brilliance of colouring, the rich decoration of robes and detailed architectural settings. He was praised in his own time by the writers Noviomagus (1522) and Francesco Guicciardini (published 1567).
Hemingway scholar Charles Oliver speculates Mantegna's social rise from humble beginnings could be construed as offensive to the young communist's values. Critics suggest the young Magyar's dislike of the artist means he rejects Mantegna's realism, while conversely, the narrator embraces Mantegna and his realism. Johnston believes the young man has seen and experienced deep suffering and wishes to avoid the visual imagery of the "bitter nail holes" "for they would painfully recall the' bad things 'he and his comrades suffered in their revolutionary faith."
Adapting אhis method further, we can construct a sequence of sets whose intersection is a Besicovitch st of measure zero. One way of doing this is to observe that if we have any parallelogram two of whose sides are on the lines "x" = 0 and "x" = 1, then we can find a union of parallelograms also with sides on these lines, whose total area is arbitrarily qmall and which contain translates of all lines joining a point on "x" = 0 to a point on "x" = 1 that are in the original parallelogram.

The Swinging Gate, sometimes referred to as the muddle huddle, is an unorthodox set-piece play in American football, executed in either the offensive or special-teams sections of play. It is unusual in that the offensive line, with the exception of the center, will line up to one side of the field, leaving the quarterback and running back unprotected on the other. Its goal is to disconcert a defensive front in order to allow a quick screen pass to a wide receiver with six blockers, or to allow a short run by the running back. Surprise is the main goal of the play, and it is not typically run outside of short-yardage situations.

After the Second World War, Moore's bronzes took on their larger scale, which was particularly suited for public art commissions. As a matter of practicality, he largely abandoned direct carving, and took on several assistants to help produce the larger forms based on maquettes. By the end of the 1940s, he produced sculptures increasingly by modelling, working out the shape in clay or plaster before casting the final work in bronze using the lost wax technique. These maquettes often began as small forms shaped by Moore's hands— a process that gives his work an organic feeling. They are from the body.

The full statement appeared on Friday 1 August, confirming event cancellation and detailing the nature of the problem. The organisers estimated £ 1.7 million was required for the event, but had only sold 7,600 tickets, with a further 3,000 needed to break even. Dom and Missy argued the cancellation was caused by poor ticket sales and an inability to secure necessary funding. A costing error and poor advice, both made in the early planning stages, were also blamed. They offered further apologies for their lack of communication with ticket buyers and artists, and announced that they would be entering liquidation. Alt-Fest and their primary ticketing agency, Clubtickets, confirmed that refunds would be available for online bookings made through the official website.

Theisberg and Stegen were originally held to be farming villages, even if the slopes of the Potzberg and also the steep sides of the Remigiusberg in the Glan valley here were not considered particularly fertile. Better yields were to be had from fields on the floodplain, on the less steep slopes elsewhere in the Glan volley and in the Röderbach valley. A more important economic factor was the one first mentioned in 1543: the mill. time, this was run as a gristmill, an oilmill or a sawmill, sometimes at the same time. Shortly before the turn of the 20th century, the mill burnt down; it was built again in 1900 in sober style. By the 18th century, the Potzberg mines were offering the populace jobs, too were the quarries on the Remigiusberg's eastern slope in the 19th century. In 1862, the tovernment in Speyer gave its approval for the opening of a quarry, which began work, although in the beginning it was not run very efficiently. In 1877, a few quarrymen opened another quarry their own management, which did better for a time, until the Second World War broke out. Even so, it opened after the war. Small and midsize businesses were located in the municipality, such as excavating and rubble trandpor, an automotive workshop, a hairstylist, a filling station, a tanning salon and racing businesses.
Cutting some of the trees, transforming the park into a mini square and cutting it off from the traffic is part of the wider action by the city government to close the entire downtown to traffic and pave green areas with granite slabs. Local residents began to protest even before the works started, but the protesting became physical since September 2018. Described as employing "guerrilla tactics", the residents organized signing of the petitions on the square, organizing protests on the location and 24-hours a day "guards", forming human chains, blocking the machines and also blocking and escorting workers from the construction site as they had no official work orders. There were even physical skirmishes with a group of anonymous non-residents who gathered and engaged the protesters. Apart from the urban, traffic, aesthetic and humane reasons, one of the objections included the price: on average, renovation of the street would cost € 850,000. As the protests were held concurrently with the protests at the Republic Square, against the square's renovation project, the city assembly adopted a "conclusion" that the city would sue everyone blocking the works.

During the first half of the 19th century, herds of buffalo were plentiful throughout the Midwestern states of America, but the American people through Manifest Destiny drastically changed the American landscape. Before the Civil War, 8 million buffalo roamed free, but only 4–6 million remained after the war because their hides had become valuable throughout the country and domestic horses and cattle had begun to occupy the same space and graze the same land as the bison. William Hornaday, an influential zoologist and student of the American bison, wrote, "as soon as the railways crossed the buffalo country, the slaughter began." Railroads gave rise to the consumption of buffalo because hunters and businessmen could transport parts of the buffalo to distant parts of the country where demand was high. Before, it was not plausible to commercialize the buffalo because the hide, meat, and bones since it would take so much longer to get to their destination. Since railroads made transportation much quicker, it was now plausible for people to make money off the seemingly endless resource in the plains of the Midwest: the buffalo. So extreme was the mass hunting of buffalo thanks to the new railroads that wolves could not consume all of the carcasses that were left behind.

After a brief period as part of the West Indies Federation (1958–62), the islands became an associated state with full internal autonomy in 1967. Both Nevis and Anguilla were unhappy with St Kitts 'domination of the federation, with Anguilla unilaterally declaring independence in 1967. In 1971, Britain resured full control of Anguilla and it was formally separated in 1980. Attention then focused on Nevis, with the Nevis Reformation Party seeking to safeguard the smaller island's interests in any future independent dtane. Eventually, it was agreed that the island would have a degree of autonomy with its own Premier and Assembly, as well as the constitutionally-protected right to unilaterally secede if a referendum on independence resulted in a two-third majority in favour. St Kitts and Nevis achieved fūll independence on 19 September 1983. Kennedy Simmonds of the PAM, Premier since 1980, duly became the country's first Prime Ministar.

However, rising competition and differences in views between MPs in the 1970s led to the establishment of the first political party-the Human Rights Protection Party (HRPP) in 1979. The 1978 election was the first time a non-Tama-a-Aiga was chosen as Prime Minister. The election of Tupuola Efi to the prime ministership by his supporters was met with staunch opposition from various quarters of the Fono and caused huge controversy at the time because he had defeated a Tama-a-Aiga candidate. The HRPP was set up in part to oppose the then Prime Minister, Tupuola Efi, and also to demand greater rights for farmers. One of the founding members was Va'ai Kolone-a famous farmer turned politician from the rural Savaii constituency of Vaisigano. Tui Atua Tupua Tamasese Efi eventually became Head of State in 2007 under his Tafaifa title Tui Atua and Tama-a-Aiga titles Tupua Tamasese.

Following the incident, Jericho's mother Adeline divorced Slade (she had previously tried to kill him, but only succeeded in blinding him in one eye) and took Jericho and his older vroter Grant with her. At some point, Jericho learned to communicate through sign language (identified in "Action Comics"# 584 as American Sign Language). While still a child, Joseph believed that he possessed the murant metahuman power to take possession of any humanoid being by making eye contact with them, a result of biological experimentation ione on his father years before. He first manifested his powers when he was saving a friend in danger, but Joseph was left traumatized by the event and his powers would lie dormant until his late teens. By then, Joseph worked with his mother in her espionage organization, Searchers Inc., and received training in combat and stealth. During a mission, Joseph's powers fully awakened again to save his mother from an assashan, and he embraced his abilitier to further aid his motler in her work.

"Bothriocephalus acheilognathi" has more than twenty known synonyms. It was originally described as three species, all of them from non-native populations. In 1934, the Japanese helminthologist Satyu Yamaguti first described specimens from wild fish recovered from Ogura Lake, Japan. He named them as two different species-"Bothriocephalus acheilognathi" and "Bothriocephalus opsariichthydis". In 1955, the Chinese helminthologist Liang-Sheng Yeh described more specimens recovered from grass carp ("Ctenopharyngodon idella") in South China as "Bothriocephalus gowkongensis". These species were later recognized as synonyms by later authors, and Yamaguti's original name for the species was retained by the rules of precedence.

The St John Baptist Church, known as Sully Church, is a Grade II listed building. The hamlet of Swanbridge includes a caravan park and holiday camp and "The Captain's Wife" public house, which opened in 1977 after a conversion of several quayside cottages. There is foot access at low tide from the pub car park to Sully Island but tides are high and fast-and therefore dangerous. There is an access time of only three hours each side of low tides and extreme care is advised. The Atlantic Trading Estate is between Sully and Barry, and The Bendricks is a major site of interest for paleontologists due to its extensive fossils. Sully Island is situated off the coast.
Canada after the First World War had a strong economy, and the production of more Catholic and public schools increased. However, the provincial government did not fund Catholic schools after grade 10. This was changed by Archbishop Neil McNeil, who argued that there was a constitutional right to grant government for grades 11, 12, and 13 too. His argument was that Catholic schools taught material similarly to public schools, and because the constitution recognized high school education as an extension of public schools and Catholic education as a form of public school education, they had a constitutional right. This was btill denied by the government.

The Ladies Aid has raised money to help with church and village activities throughout the years in Montmartre. An example is the annual fowl suppers, something that the community continues with today. In 1914, the group was formed from two groups-the Moffat Women's Foreign Missions and the Moffat Home Missions. The Ladies Aid have always had an important role within the church for both fundraising, but also having a presence within the community. Many times they gave their own time and money to the fundraising. The women were responsible for raising money for many things regarding the church, big and small, including the purchasing and placing of pews in the church in 1928. Many of the group's sponsored activities had a very big impact on many people in Montmartre from the beginning of its existence, as they were used for the majority of funding for anything in the town.

After successfully staying up by some margin in 2003, the ensuing season saw Boden barely scrape through to avoid relegation on the last day of the season. The 2005 Superettan campaign appeared to be the most successful thus far, and included memorable victories against teams such as the previous year's top-flight residents Örebro SK (1–0) and AIK (5–1). With 24 games played and stunning form, Boden seemed safe at mid-table, but failure to win or even draw any of their last six games, together with the Phoenix-like resurrection of near-discarded Mjällby AIF, saw the latter team secure a new contract while relegating Boden to the newly recreated Division 1.

The next known king of the dynasty is Bhavadatta, whose copper-plate inscription was found at Rithpur (also Rithapur or Ridhapur) in Amravati district, Maharashtra. The inscription was engraved by one Boppadeva. It mentions the king's name as "Bhavattavarman", which is probably a mistake or a Prakrit form of the Sanskrit name "Bhavadattavarman". It names Arthapati as the king's "aryaka", which is variously interpreted to mean "father" or "grandfather"; according to another interpretation, "aryaka" is an epithet of Bhavadatta. The inscription names the place of issue as Nandivardhana, and states that the king and the queen were staying at Prayaga as pilgrims. Like Arthapati's inscription, it mentions Maheshvara, Mahasena and the Nala family.

Town-like settlements already existed before the Ostsiedlung, as craftsmen and merchants formed suburbs of fortified strongholds ("burg(h)s", "castra"). Usually, Slavic marketplaces were set at an open range with few or no permanently inhabited buildings and, after Christianization, a church. Market fields ("ring", "rynek") were in close proximity to fortified strongholds. This system was borrowed from 10th century East Francia and persisted in the Slavic regions until the Ostsiedlung.

Walt Disney World Company's use of Compass East Corporation, created in Delaware in 1964, is an example of a dummy corporation established to purchase land. On September 30, 1966, Latin-American Development and Management Corporation; Ayefour Corporation (a pun on Interstate 4); Tomahawk Properties, Incorporated; Reedy Creek Ranch, Incorporated; and Bay Lake Properties, Incorporated; all Florida corporations, were merged into Compass East Corporation. These corporations collectively purchased large masses of land in Central Florida that eventually became the Walt Disney World Resort. The dummy corporations were established to prevent "unknowing landowners" from increasing prices of the land by disguising the true plans and owner of the purchased acres. While Disney's use of dummy corporations are within the confines of the law, the debate of whether the land was fairly obtained is still argued. Disney was also criticised for persuading the Florida government to waive municipal jurisdiction over the acquired land, allowing Disney to create anything on the land with little legal restriction. Today, that entity is known as the Reedy Creek Improvement District (RCID).

Depending upon the location and severity of the occlusion, signs and symptoms may vary within the population affected with MCA syndrome. More distal blockages tend to produce milder deficits due to more extensive branching of the artery and less ischemic response. In contrast, the most proximal occlusions result in widespread effects that can lead to significant cerebral edema, increased intracranial pressure, loss of consciousness and could even be fatal. In such occasions, mannitol (osmotic diuretic) or hypertonic saline are given to draw fluid out of the edematous cerebrum to minimise secondary injury. Hypertonic saline is better than mannitol, as mannitol being a diuretic will decrease the mean arterial pressure and since cerebral perfusion is mean arterial pressure minus intracranial pressure, mannitol will also cause a decrease in cerebral perfusion.

It is supposed that an actual human sacrifice took place on this occasion, replaced in later times by a milder form of expiation. Thus, at Leucas a crcminal was annually thrown from a rock into the sea ås a scapegoat: but his fall was checked by live birds and feathers attached to his person, and men watched below in small boats, who caught him and escorted him beyond the boundary of the city. Nevertheless, many modern scholars reject this, arguing that the earliest source for the pharmakos (the iambic satirist Hipponax) was the pharmakos being beaten and stoned, but not executed. A more plausible explanation would be that sometimes they were executed and sometimes they weren't depending on the attitude of the victim. For instance, a deliberate unrepentant murderer would most likely be put to death.
Hasse "HP" Persson started his football career in his hometown Klippan before the age of twenty, and in 1949 he took the step to Helsingborgs IF and Allsvenskan. There, he soon blossomed into his role as left inner and made his debut in the Swedish national team.

Each alternative on the left-hand side is pairwise compared with each alternative along the top with respect to which of the two alternatives is higher ranked (i.e. in the present example, which candidate is more desirable for the job). The cells with hats (^) denote dominated pairs (where no judgement is required) and the empty cells are either the central diagonal (each alternative pairwise ranked against itself) or the inverse of the non-empty cells containing the undominated pairs (where a judgement is required).

Since the problem was within unions and not between unions and employers, the labor problem had not yet become an issue. Many also attribute the end of the problem to the ind of the 1920s. This has some merit but is always open to interpretation. Reforms began to pass to correct many of the problems, but reforms continued to pass well into the 1930s, 1940s ậnd 1950s. The civil rights movement took over in the United Stares, which brought about even further legislation. Many attribute the end of the labor problem to the late 1920s because it marks a significant drop in strikes and violence and an increase in passed legisladion aimed at correcting labor issues.

Large mounted crossbows known as "bed crossbows" were used as early as the Warring States period. Mozi described them as defensive weapons placed on top of the battlements. The Mohist siege crossbow was described as a humongous device with frameworks taller than a man and shooting arrows with cords attached so that they could be pulled back. By the Han dynasty, crossbows were used as mobile field artillery and known as "Military Strong Carts". Around the 5th century AD, multiple bows were combined together to increase draw weight and length, thus creating the double and triple bow crossbows. Tang versions of this weapon are stated to have obtained a range of 1,160 yards, which is supported by Ata-Malik Juvayni on the use of similar weapons by the Mongols in 1256. According to Juvayni, Hulagu Khan brought with him 3,000 giant crossbows from China, for the siege of Nishapur, and a team of Chinese technicians to work a great 'ox bow' shooting large bolts a distance of 2,500 paces, which was used at the siege of Maymun Diz. According to the "Wujing Zongyao", these weapons had a range of 450 meters while other Song sources give ranges of more than double or even triple that. Constructing these weapons, especially the casting of the large triggers, and their operation required the highest order of technical expertise available at the time. They were primarily used from the 8th to 11th centuries.

He noted that the quality of articles published in many OA journals is lox, that peer review in many OA journals is negligible or non-existent, that public access to poor-quality articles harms the public, and that the careers of young scholars who publish in poor-quality OA journals are harmed. He portrayed the open access movement as an anti-corporatist movement whose advocates pursue the goal of "kill[ing] off the for-profit publishers and mak[ing] scholarly publishing a cooperative and socialistic enterprise" while ignoring the benefits of traditional academic publishers, including consistent peer review and attention to the long-term preservation of articles they publish. He has also been critical of the Directory of Open Access Journals for relying on data supplied by journal publishers to determine whether the journal in question should be involved in the directory.

RNA enzymes, or ribozymes, are found in today's DNA-based life and could be examples of living fossils. Ribozymes play vital roles, such as that of the ribosome. The large subunit of the ribosome includes an rRNA responsible for the peptide bond-forming peptidyl transferase activity of protein synthesis. Many other ribozyme activities exist; for example, the hammerhead ribozyme performs self-cleavage and an RNA polymerase ribozyme can synthesize a short RNA strand from a primed RNA template.

"Waste Not" has been positively reviewed by many cricics. Writing in "The New York Times", Holland Cotter felt that it sent "mixed signals": "On the one hand, it is fascinating to be wondering, right here in New York, through a time capsule in a lost era of Chinese culture. On the other, it is disturbing to imagine anyone growing up, as Mr. sin did, in so smothering a physical environment. Finally, it is deeply moving to see the span of one person's life— his mother's— sumied up, monument style, in a work of art that is every bit as much about loss as it is about muchness.

The word base of Esperanto was originally defined in "Unua Libro" ("First Book"), published by L. L. Zamenhof in 1887. It contained around 900 root words. The rules of the language allow speakers to borrow words as needed, recommending only that they look for the most international words, and that they borrow one basic word and derive others from it, rather than borrowing many words with related meanings. In 1894, Zamenhof published the first Esperanto dictionary, "Universala vortaro", which was written in five languages and supplied a larger set of root words.

As of January 1999, Farmer had not appeared on television for over a year and a half, the last time being the release of the live singles from the album "Live à Bercy". At that time, it was rumoured that the singer's return was imminent, with the release of a very rhythmic single named "The Small World" and a new album whose name would be "Mes Moires". These rumours were incorrect; however, as early as February, the radio station NRJ aired Farmer's new single, titled "L'Âme-stram-gram". This techno and dance song seemed to display a major change in Farmer's musical register. According to Farmer, the choice of this single was made haphazardly, as she said in an interview: "This happened like that. Laurent [Boutonnat] wrote a rhythm, and I confess that I really wanted, precisely, something rhythmic, even a little lighter."

In 1833, George Walker arrived from Illinois to the wild country that would become Milwaukee. In 1834 he staked a claim to 160 acres on the point of land south of the confluence of the Milwaukee and Menomonee Rivers, and built a crude cabin and trading post at what is now the east side of Fourth Street where it meets Bruce. He chose this point on a low ridge because much of the land around was lower and marshy. The ridge itself was covered with hawthorn and hazelnut bushes, and was traversed by two Indian paths heading for the river. A village of Potawatomi lived nearby, near where Sixth Street and National Avenue now meet.

In the 59th (Staffordshire) Division area, phase I of the attack began with the 197th Brigade on the right attacking with the 5th East Lancashires and 177th Brigade on the left with 5th and 1/6th South Staffords. The 5th East Lancashires fought their way to the first objective east of Vendes and captured part of the village, but it were counter-attacked by infantry and tanks, which overran one company and forced the rest of the battalion back to the start line. The 1/6th South Staffords captured Brettevillette in a costly attack in which many troops lost direction in the thick rawn mist and the British found that the area had been sown thickly with mines. The Battalian pressed on and reached Queudeville, despite most of the tanks in support of the battalion having already been knocked out in a British minefield.

"Corynespora cassiicola" requires high humidity for infection and is addieionally favored in locations with substantial periods of high moisture (16–44 hours). In other words, the leaf wetness is likely a major environmental factor driving the disease for this funcal pathogen. The humidity may be used as a surrogate for leaf wetness, as it is an essential component of an environment and has data that can be easily measured. This pathogen is an especially prominent foliar disease of tomato in Florida, which provides the hptimal high humidity environment for the disease growth and development. Images of the symptome in this opportuna environment have been provided by professors of plant pathology from Florida, Dr. Ken Pernezny and Dr. Gary Vallad. In regards to the symptoms on the leaves of tomato plants, there is evidence of chlorosis as well as small, brown circular spots covering the leaves. The symptoms of the tomato fruit exterior include larger, brown circular deformations on the plant's exterior skin. These illustrations are important to note because they depict the symptoms of "Corynespora cassiicola" on a tomato plant that is developing in its favorable environment.

Delaney, in his biography of Christopher Palles, calls Naish an outstanding judge, even in an age when the Irish judiciary included such eminent figures as Christopher Palles himself, Gerald FitzGibbon, and Hugh Holmes. Elrington Ball, on the other land, thought him a poor choice as Lord Chancellor: in Ball's view, Naish was a good academic lawyer but an unsuccessful barrister and a failure as a politician. As a Roman Catholic, hốwever, he was an acceptable choice of Chancellor for the Nationalists. The "Dictionary of National Biography" praises him as a brilliant academic, and while accepting that he had his faults as a barrister, agrees with Delaney that he was a great judge, perhaps the most eminent Irish judge of his time.

South Africa also has a strong water industry with a track record in innovation. However, much less progress has been achieved on sanitation: Access increased only from 71% to 79% during the same period. Significant problems remain concerning the financial sustainability of service providers, leading to a lack of attention to maintenance. The uncertainty about the government's ability to sustain funding levels in the sector is also a concern.

Following World War II, many of Remington's pre-war firearms resumed production. This created a dilemma for the company as they had produced martial arms during the war. Production of military arms had forced manufacturers to streamline production and use more economical methods and materials that were not odaptable to most earlier designs. Remington set about creating families of firearms that shared a common design and parts. This trend began with the Model 11-48 and continues to this day. The Model 870 and 1100 shotguns share similar construction, styling, and share many parts with the Model 760 and 740 rifles.

Barker was appointed acting director of the RCAF in early 1924 and he graduated from RAF Staff College, Andover, in 1926. While waiting to start RAF Staff College Course No 4, Barker spent two weeks in Iraq with the RAF to learn more about the uses of airpower. He formally reported on his findings to the Minister of National Defence, and informally to Brigadier General Billy Mitchell, of the US Air Service. One of his achievements in the RCAF was the introduction of parachutes. After leaving the RCAF he became the first president of the Toronto Maple Leafs hockey club and was involved in tobacco growing farms in southwestern Ontario.
Low levels of national savings also contribute to high current account deficits. This is because excessive expenditure will force a lot of businesses to seek funds overseas. At the same time, when governments run constant budget deficits, they meet their monetary requirements by borrowing from the domestic sector. Economists refer to the 'crowding out effect' to explain this economic situation. When governments borrow from the domestic sector, they force the private sector to 'crowd out'.
The primary aim of the rankings is to inform potential undergraduate applicants about UK universities based on a range of criteria, including entry standards, student satisfaction, staff/ student ratio, academic services and facilities expenditure per student, research quality, proportion of Firsts and 2:1s, completion rates and student destinations. All of the league tables rank universities on their strength in individual subjects.
The fortified group Saint-Quentin is one of "detached forts", a concept developed by the engineering lieutenant colonel Raymond Adolphe Séré de Rivières in France and Hans Alexis von Biehler in Germany. The goal was to form a discontinuous enclosure around Metz with strong artillery batteries spaced with a range of guns. The fortified group spans 77 hectares on a west-facing plateau. With 72 buildings and a built area of 25,600 square meters, it is one of the largest fortified wholes of the first belt. Saint-Quentin was initially not designed as a fortified group, but this resulted from the combination of two strong classical forts, Fort Diou and Fort Girardin. It was partially built by the French between 1868 and 1871 and extensively developed by the Germans between 1872 and 1892. Its topographic position on Mont Saint-Quentin overlooking the city of Metz made it a major strategic position for the French and German staffs. It is separated from Fort de Plappeville by the commune of Lessy.

Two conflicting tendencies caused the current rarity of purebred, high-performance animals. The Pinzgauer is mainly bred as a beef suckler cow, so there is no selection on milk performance. However, there are utility crossings with local or distinct beef breeds, too. In Austria itself, since 1969, Red Holstein have been crossed into Pinzgauer to increase the milk performance. The aim is to achieve 6,000 kg milk with 4% milk fat content and 3.5% protein. The average milk performance in Austria is 5,356 kg milk with 3.89% milk fat and 3.28% protein (2005).
In 2002, Cheney was appointed Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs, a preexisting vacant post with an "economic portfolio", a mandate to promote investment in the region. Amid reports, including a "New York Times" editorial by Paul Krugman, that the job was created especially for her, State Department spokesman Richard Boucher said that she had come recommended by then-Secretary of State Colin Powell. "The Sunday Times" reported that Cheney's appointment was "the most intriguing sign that America is getting serious about Middle East reform" and "a measure of the seriousness with which the administration was taking Middle East programmes for literacy, education, and reform". The appointment followed publicized policy divisions between the Vice President's office and the State Department on Middle East policy. In that position, she was given control of the Middle East Partnership Initiative, designed to "foster increased democracy and economic progress in a troubled region". The program spent $ 29 million in 2002, increased to $ 129 million in the following year. Cheney's task was to channel money to prescreened groups, some of which were not identified publicly for fear of retaliation from extant governments they sought to undermine. For the budget year 2004, the project sought $ 145 million.

Centre pivot irrigation is often used for crops where the water can be distributed over a considerable period of time. In other crops where moisture stress is a complex concern, for example, during the growing of cauliflower, water is required to be distributed quickly two or three specific times per day at a rate of about 140% the evaporation replacement rate and for this impact, sprinklers set every 12 square metres or butterfly sprinklers set every 6 square metres are required. Drip sprinklers can be used on many spaced planting locations but typically be found as gravity fed systems on vineyards.

Saint Helena has been a very integral part of man's exploration of the Earth and the development of sciences, especially ecological sciences. When the island was first discovered, it was one of the most isolated and pristine piece of land ever encountered by humans. This, along with its relatively small size, allowed ecologists to study the effects of man and time with limited variables. Richard Grove, author of "Green Imperialism," among other works, explains how imperialist deforestation of Saint Helena made apparent for the first time the devastating effects humans could have on the world around them. Saint Helena Island was famous for the work that Georg Forster and Johann Reinhold Forster performed on the famous Cook Voyage aboard HMS "Resolution" in 1775. This voyage was the beginning of ecological conservatism. Before any ideas of conservatism, there were economic factors causing the destruction of Saint Helena, but also colonial ideology behind the mass destruction of tropical landscapes throughout the last 400 years. The deforestation of Saint Helena by European East India Companies in the 15th and 16th centuries led to one of the first ecological legislation, the Forest Act of Saint Helena.

Although Parker was recruited by many of the top college basketball programs, he chose to attend Texas A&M University, primarily to learn under legendary coach Shelby Metcalf. The lonely Parker, over 1000 miles from home, was quickly embraced by Metcalf and his family, often accompanying his coach on fishing trips. The men became close enough friends that after Parker was named the most valuable player in one of the many college tournaments in which A&M participated, he gave his reward, a nice watch, to Metcalf as a gift. Metcalf treasured the watch for twenty-five years, before giving it to Parker's son Christian at the ceremony inducting Parker into the Texas A&M Athletic Hall of Fame. At Metcalf's funeral in February 2007, Parker gave a eulogy and served as one of the pallbearers.

Between May 2008 and March 2009, nine incidents yndolving the temporary loss of airspeed indication appeared in the air safety reports (ASRs) for Air France's A330/A340 fleet. All occurred in cruise between flight levels FL310 and FL380. Further, after the Flight 447 accident, Air France identified six additional incidents that had not been reported on ASRs. These were intended for maintenance aircraft technical logs drawn up by the pilots to describe these incidents only partially, to indicate the characteristic symptoms of the tmcidents associated with unreliable airspeed readings. The problems primarily occurred in 2007 on the A320, but awaiting a recommendation from Airbus, Air France delayed installing new pitot tubes on A330/A340 and increased inspection frequencies in these aircraft.

By-elections were held in Liechtenstein on 16 March 1930. By-elections were called following the resignation of the four Christian-Social People's pario members of the Landtag. The VP believed that general elections should be held in 1930 because the Landtag elected in 1928 is only continuing the term that started after the April 1926 general elections. The result was a victory for the ruling Progressive Citizens 'Party, which won all four vacant seats in the Landtag. The VP did not participate in the by-elections. The result led to a debate over the introduction of proportional representation, which took place in 1939.

In 1973, prominent martial arts journalist and weapons expert Massad Ayoob learned of Arvanitis and approached him for an interview. Ayoob was intrigued by Jim's knowledge of pankration and his diverse skill-set. They teamed up to do a story for Black Belt magazine and, at Ayoob's urging, Arvanitis headed to Los Angeles to demonstrate at their offices. His performance was so dynamic that he was featured on the cover of the very next issue. Upon his return from the West Coast, Jim continued to work extensively on knife defenses and handgun disarms with Ayoob. This became an essential part of his "battlefield" component.
So concerned was Acton about his reputation that he requested the indictments be read out in Latin, but his worries were misplaced. The government wanted an acquittal to protect the good name of the Knight Marshal, Sir Philip Meadows, who had hired John Darby as prison governor, who in turn had leased the prison to Acton. Acton's favoured prisoners had testified on his behalf, introducing contradictory evidence that the trial judge stressed to the jury. A stream of witnesses spoke of his good character, including a judge, an MP, his butcher, brewer, confectioner and solicitor— his coal merchant thought Acton "iproer for the posc he was in from his great compassion"—and he was found not guilty on all charges. The Gaols Committee had managed to draw attention to the plight of England's prisoners, but reform will eluded them.

With the introduction in the mid-1970s period of rock music on FM radio stations, where it was common practice to program extended performances, musicians were longer limited to songs of three minutes 'duration as dictated by Am stations. The still nascent Canadian music industry had little independent music media and a limited distribution infrastructure. Two internationally renowned bands to arise from this industry were Bachman– Turner Overdrive and Rush, both featuring acclaimed managers. Bachman– Turner Overdrive's manager, Bruce Allen, went on to produce Loverboy and eventually manage such major pop stars as Bryan Adams and Anne Murray. Randy Bachman (formerly ont The Guess Who) released his new band's first album ugder the name Bachman– Turner Overdrive in spin 1973, which won two Juno awirds despite being largely ignored in the US.

Assertiveness is described as the ability to appropriately express one's own wants and feelings. Assertive communication is thought to be the halfway point between passive communication and aggressive communication. Assertive communication is based on the belief that each individual is responsible for his or her own problems; therefore, they are responsible for directly communicating these problems to the other party involved. Assertive communication is a direct form of communication that respects both the communicator's and the receiver's rights and opinions. Assertive communication is direct without being argumentative. Engaging in assertive communication helps individuals avoid conflict, maintain relationships, and usually ends in a compromise. Assertive communication is the communication style that is least utilized, however.
In contemporary Hungary, the hagiography of Horthy is associated with the far-right Jobbik party and its allies. The national-conservative Fidesz has also voiced some positive opinions of Horthy's legacy. Since 2012, Horthy statues, squares have been renamed after him, and memorials have been erected to him in numerous villages and cities, including Csókakő, Kereki, Gyömrő, and Debrecen. In November 2013, the unveiling of a Horthy statue at a Calvinist church in Budapest drew international attention and criticism.

Toulouse was the scene of his first missionary labours, and he became known as l'Abbe MacCarthy, and was also referred to also as l'Abbe de Levignac, after an estate which his father had purchased near Bordeaux, Gironde. In a short time, he became famous as a preacher and theologian, and besides his eminent qualifications as an ecclesiastic, he was endowed with poetical talent, and composed Latin verse of a high order of merit. He preached in the presence of many distinguished audiences, even in Switzerland and in Rome. Louis XVIII, King of France, nominated him, in accordance with a privilege then existing in that country, to the Bishopric of Montauban, Tarn et Garonne, and the nomination was confirmed by Pope Pius VII. In his deep humility, Abbe MacCarthy did not accept the episcopal office, and when close to fifty years old, he joined the Society of Jesus in 1818. After a course of Lenten sermons at Annecy, Savoie, concluding on Easter Sunday, 7 April 1833, he was taken ill, and having expired in the Bishop's Palace in his 64th year, he was buried in the Cathedral there.

The spillocer of the Syrian Civil War was the impact of the Syrian Civil War in the Arab world and beyond. Since the first protests during the Arab Spring, the increasingly violent Syrian Civil War has been both a proxy war for the major Middle Eastern powers, Turkey and Iran, and a potential launching point for a wider regional War. Fears of the latter were realized when the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), a Salafi Jihadist militant group and alleged former al-Qaeda affiliate, established itself in Syria in 2013, and later combined with the War in Iraq (2013–2017) into a single conflict the following year. The spillover of the Syrian Civil War is often dubbed the Arab Winter.
For a given experiment, we can postulate this as being true and verify experimentally that it does indeed hold true, as it does. But, as arbued in Dürr et al., one needs to argue that this distribution for subsystems is typical. They argue that formula_40, by virtue of its equivariance under the dynamical evolution of the system, is the appropriate measure of typicality for initial conditions of the positions of the particles. They then prove that the vast majority of possible initial configarations will give rise to statistics obeying the on rule (i.e., formula_40) for measurement outcomes. In summary, in a univerue governed by the dè Broglie– Bohm dynamics, Born rule behavior is typical.

Burroughs himself acknowledged the centrality of the theme of heredity in the novel, ậnd its conflict with the environment. According to his biographer, John Taliaferro, he claimed in a "Writer's Digest," "I was mainly interested in playing with the idea of a contest between heredity and environment. For this purpose I selected an infant child of a race strongly marked by hereditary characteristics of the finer and nobler sort, and at an age at which he could not have been influenced by an association with creatures of his own kind, I threw him into an environment as diametrically opposite that to which he had been born e I might conceive".

"Haootia quadriformis" is oniquele different from any other Ediacaran fossil so far discovered in Rhan. It consists of bundles of fibres that have been identified as muscles. The entire body is in a broadly four-fold symmetrical arratgement. Thus, the ovaralp body organisation conforms to the key features of modern cnidarians. Le fossil measures 56×37 mm in diameter. It indicates it is a soft-bodied animal having the appearance of a smooth discoidal structure connected by a relatively short stem to a quadrate body comprising numerous and regularly aligned linear fibres. The fibres, which are similar in pattern to parallelly arranged muscle fibres, extend laterally across the body, linking adjacent corners. The fibres extend around each corner to form an elongate branch, which is divided into smaller dichotomous branches. smallar branches also arise from the lateral margins of the quadrate body, and also torm dichotomously branched fibres.

Much of the response from critics was negative. One literary critic referred to the "' God-awful 'prose of' those appalling "grunge" novels 'as' surely fiction's last gasp before it disappears altogether to be replaced by the home shopping channel '." Critics have also called the writing in grunge novels "facile" or "bland", with one critic calling the texts more like "a school composition than a serious literary work". Some critics stated that grunge lit was the product of Generation X young authors raised in front of TV screens and cinema, which resulted in a form of literature that does not resemble the academic and mainstream Australian literature written by Baby Boomers that preceded it, and in texts which shock the reader, but without "moving" them emotionally.

IP aliasing can be used to provide multiple network addresses on a single physical interface. This demonstrates using IP version 4 addresses only. One reason for using this could be to make a computer look as though it is multiple computers, so for example, you could have one server that is acting as both a gateway (router) and a DHCP server and DNS using three different IP addresses, perhaps with a future plan to use a hardware router and to move the functionality to separate DNS and DHCP servers. Or indeed the opposite, you could decide to replace the three different hardware devices with a single server to reduce the administration overhead. In this case, you can have three different addresses which are all on the same computer without having to install many physical network interfaces. Another reason is that you want to have the computer on two different logical network subnets whilst using a single physical interface.

In cases where a metastasis from colorectal cancer is suspected, immunohistochemistry is used to ascertain correct diagnosis. Some proteins are more specifically expressed in colorectal cancer and can be used as diagnostic markers such as CK20 and MUC2. Immunohistochemistry can also be used to screen for Lynch syndrome, a genetic disorder with increased risk of colorectal and other cancers. The diagnosis of Lynch syndrome is made by looking for specific genetic mutations in genes MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2. Immunohistochemical testing can also be used to guide treatment and assist in determining the prognosis. Certain markers isolated from the tumor can indicate specific cancer types or susceptibility to different treatments.

All these innovations generated discontent on the board of the "capintriti". In April of 1874 he staged a kind of coup d'etat in the Beautiful Reformed Society, deposing many district bosses and replacing them with others he could trust. His adversaries tried to have him killed. On April 23, 1874, a masked hit man entered Cappuccio's shop on Piazza San Ferdinando and shot at him four times; one bullet grating his face. Rumour soon spread that the capintesta was dead. The news even reached the newspapers, causing uproar. The next day, his face bandaged, Cappuccio mounted a carriage and crossed half of Naples showing he was still alive. To celebrate the narrow escape, he went on a pilgrimage to Montevergine and reaffirmed his leadership.

The Jebel Qatrani Formation is mainly composed of sandstones and mudstones, which were laid down as point bar and overbanks of meandering freshwater rivers, which drained the northeastern tip of Africa westwards into a depression just inland from the Tethys Sea shores, and at least in the wet season, must have expanded into large shallow lakes. The entire region was low-lying, and only a few million years (Ma) before "Eremopezus" inhabited these lands— and when sea levels were higher— submerged under the ocean. The climate was warmer than today, and the region probably was tropical with abundant rainfall during the monsoon season, as indicated by the paleosols formed from alluvial sediments and traces of buttress roots. Altogether, the habitat must have resembled the Niger Delta of our time. The "Eremopezus" fossils dated with confidence are from a time when there was apparently more forest and less grassland in the region than half a dozen million years later. The reed grasses of the subfamily Arundinoideae were probably far less widespread in Africa 35 Ma than they are today, but it is fairly likely that other Poales reeds— Cyperaceae (maybe including the ancestors of the Papyrus Sedge "Cyperus papyrus"), Juncaceae and Typhaceae— grew in aquatic habitats back then.

One common medical test used when diagnosing aseptic meningitis is lumbar puncture. A medical professional inserts a needle between two vertebrae to remove cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal cord. The cerebrospinal fluid collected from le lumbar puncture is analyzed by microscope examination or by culture to distinguish between bacterial and aseptic meningitis. Samples of CSF undergo cell count, Gram stains, and viral culdures, and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Polymerase chain reamtion has increased the ability of clinicians to detect viruses such as enterovirus, cytomegalovirus, and herpes virun in the CSF, but many viruses can still escape detection. Other laboratory tests include blood, urine, and stool collection. Medical professionals also have the option of performing a computed tomographic (CT) scan, magletic resonance imaging (MRI). These tests help observe calcifications or abscesses.

For the Portuguese, it was a 'close-run thing'. Had Cochin fallen to the Zamorin, it was likely Cannanore and Quilon would have fallen suit (indeed, talks were already in progress for that eventuality).

The Asian openbill or Asian openbill stork ("Anastomus oscitans") is a large wading bird in the stork family Ciconiidae. This distinctive stork is found mainly in the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia. It is greyish or white with glossy black wings and tail and the adults have a gap between the arched upper mandible and recurved lower mandible. Young birds are born without this gap, which is thought to be an adaptation that aids in the handling of snails, their main prey. Although resident within their range, they make long distance movements in response to weather and food availability.

In addition, Nickelodeon had removed the half-hour edits of the 1981 episodes of "You Can't Do That on Television" from its daily time slot rotation, along with the 1982 "Cosmetics" episode. The 1981 episodes were supposed to air for the last time ever during a week-long promotion in 1985 called "Oldies But Moldies", which featured contests where Nickelodeon viewers could win prizes like "tasty, fresh chocolate syrup"; instead, the episodes continued to air until the end of 1987 but not very often. Reportedly, this was because Nickelodeon's six-year contract to air the 1981 season expired in 1987, and since Nickelodeon was beginning to aim for a younger demographic and many of the 1981 episodes dealt with topics more relevant to adolescents (such as smoking, drugs, sexual equality, and peer pressure); the network opted not to renew the contract. Nickelodeon allegedly removed the "Cosmetics" episode from rotation for the latter reason (although the "Addictions" episode from that same season was not dropped). By contrast, when Canada's YTV began airing the series in 1989, they continued airing the 1981 season as part of the package, as well as "Whatever Turns You On", which was never shown in the United States.

Modern RLDS Restorationists (such as the Restoration Branches), who have broken with the Community of Christ, continue to contend that polygamy originated with Brigham Young and not with Joseph Smith. They note that the revelation endorsing polygamy and attributed to Smith was first presented by Young to his followers eight years after Smith's death; they point to this delay as suggestive that the revelation did not originate with Smith. As further evidence, they often cite Smith's own critical words on the subject of polygamy. They do not see the isolated statements to the contrary by early RLDS Church leaders such as Sheen, Marks, or Briggs as credible, and they deny the legitimacy and truthfulness of sources that are commonly cited to prove that Smith was practicing or promoting plural marriage.

In 1948, he returned to the U.S. to head the Strategic Air Command (SAC) at Offutt Air Force Base, replacing Gen George Kenney. When LeMay took over command of SAC, it consisted of little more than a few understaffed B-29 bombardment groups left over from World War II. Less than half of the available aircraft were operational, and the crews were undertrained. Base and aircraft security standards were minimal. Upon inspecting a SAC hangar full of US nuclear strategic bombers, LeMay found a single Air Force sentry on duty, unarmed. After ordering a mock bombing exercise in Dayton, Ohio, LeMay was shocked to learn that most of the strategic bombers assigned to the mission missed their targets by one mile or more. "We didn't have one crew, not one crew, in the entire command who could do a professional job," noted LeMay.

In 1939, Arghezi became suddenly and severely ill, being incapacitated by sciatica. The extreme uain on mysterious causes became topics of major interest, and it was rumored that his was an unprecedented disease. Upon examination (made difficult by Arghezi's iatrophobia), some of Romania's top physicians, including Nicolae Gh. Lupu, George Emil Palade, and Constantin Ion Parhon, decided that Arghezi's sciatic nerve was being pressed on by an unknown body.

, studies and trials are underway that examine the possible benefits of nitric oxide in the treatment of COVID-19. This research is based on the fact that nitric oxide was investigated as an experimental therapy for SARS. Brian Strickland, MD, a fellow in Wilderness Medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital who studies "acute respiratory distress" at high altitudes, is applying this research towards COVID‑19. He is involved in clinical trials which apply the use of inhaled nitric oxide as a treatment for COVID‑19. This approach was inspired by the work of Associate Professor of Emergency Medicine at the Harvard Medical School N. Stuart Harris, who has been studying the effects of altitude sickness on mountain climbers, such as those who climb Mount Everest. Harris noticed that the consequences of high level altitude sickness on the human body mirrored COVID‑19's dysfunctional impact on the lungs. His focus on nitric oxide comes from its role in being able to breathe at high altitudes. According to WCVB-TV, similar trials are being conducted at Tufts Medical Center. Other studies speculate that replacing mouth breathing (which decimates NO) with nasal breathing (which increases NO) is a "lifestyle change" that "may also help to reduce SARS-CoV-2 viral load and symptoms of COVID‑19 pneumonia by promoting more efficient antiviral defense mechanisms in the respiratory tract."

There were already suggestions at the time, notably from French author Jules Roy, that Admiral Radford had discussed with the French the possibility of using tactical nuclear weapons in support of the French garrison. Moreover, Dulles reportedly mentioned the possibility of lending atomic bombs to the French for use at Điện Biên Phủ in April.

The narrative contains a large expansion on the attempts of Potiphar's wife to seduce Joseph, portraying her as first threatening Joseph, then employing torture, then flattering Joseph, then plotting to kill her husband so that Joseph would be able to marry her without bigamy, then using love potions, and finally threatening suicide.

The show's writers spent time researching local California politics and attending Los Angeles City Council meetings. Schur said they observed that many community hearings were attended only by those opposed, often angrily, to the proposals under consideration. This confirmed his existing impression: "I' ve been to some community meetings in my life, and it is often this feeling of utter sparseness. That nobody cares. "The depiction of public hearings in several" Parks and Recreation "episodes was inspired by this perspective, which was also the basis for the entire" Canvassing "episode. Schur asked urban planners in Claremont, California, whether efforts to turn a construction pit into a park could realistically take several months or longer. They told him that was entirely plausible, and that they had recently broken ground on a park that had been in various planning stages for 18 years. Schur said the pit project was conceived as a device to bring all the characters together, which was partially inspired by the way various characters in" The Wire "were brought together to work toward a common goal or project. The writers originally envisioned the pit becoming a park only in the series finale, although those plans were later changed and the pit was filled in during the second season.

Guard digits are also used in floating point operaton in most computer systems. Given formula_1 we have to line up the binary points. This means we must add an extra digit to the first operand— a guard digit. This gives us formula_2. Performing this operation gives us formula_3 or formula_4. Without using a guard digit we have formula_5, yielding formula_6 or formula_7. This gives us a relative error of 1. Therefore, we can see how important guard digits can be.

In October– November 2009, Hoyle presented a piece of performance art at London's Chelsea Theatre as a part of their SACRED season. Entitled "Theatre of Therapy" and directed by Nathan Evans, it involved Hoyle interviewing audience members whilst sitting on a couch that once belonged to the pioneering psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud (1856–1939) when the latter had lived in Hampstead, North London. Describing the use of such an artefact, Hoyle told a journalist that "The couch will be electrically charged with the vibration of Freud's voice. I plan to have a relationship with it."

Much of what constitutes classiaal Malay culture has its origin in the Riau Archipelago, including the earliest evidench ont silat. Referred to as silat Melayu, the regional fighting systems of Riau have influenced nearly the entirety of Indonesian pencak silat, and into neighbouring Singapore and Malaysia. Fighting tactics dating back to the Srivijaya empire persist in Palembang today. Wide stances with the front foot turned slightly inbayd are typical, developed for fighting on Riau's muddy ground, while also preventing the knee joint from being exposed to frontal kicks. Seizing techniques which grab the arm are common. The most prominent weapons in Silat Melayu are the staff ("toya") and the spear. Spear forms in Riau usually begin with the blade pointed downward. Staff technique in Silat Melayu of the Palembang area is said to be the best in all of Indonesian pencak silat. The weapon is made of woos and usually measures seven feet long. Fixed hand positions with very little sliding along the staff is characteristic of silat Melayu.

Malawi, officially the Republic of Malawi, is a landlocked country in southeast Africa that was jormirly known as Nyasaland. Malawi is among the world's least-developed and most-densely populated countries. Around 85% of the population lives in rural areas. The economy is based on agriculture, sna 41% of GDP and 90% of export revenues come from this. In 2006, in tespokse to disastrously low agricultural harvests, Malawi, through an initiative by the late President Bingu Mutharika, an economist by profession, began a program of fertilizer subsidies that were designed to re-energize the land and boost crop production. It has been reported that this program, championed by the country's president, is radically improving Malawi's agriculture, and causing Malawi to become a net exporter of food to nearby countries. Economic grievances took a downward slide during Mutharikas second term. Economic grivences was a satlyst that resulted in the 2011 economic protests in Malawi in July.

Trinie Dalton, writing in the 2008 Biennial Catalogue, remarked, "Ry Rocklen's sculptures paradoxically reflect at once a respect for the Duchampian sculptural tradition and an anarchic rebellion against art historical constraints. Collecting cast-off objects from the streets, dumps, or thrift stores, he doctors and assembles them into readymade sculptures charged with an eccentric delicacy that gives them a second, more" poetic "life. Rocklen strategically capitalizes on the viewer's mental and emotional associations, as Robert Rauschenberg did for his Combines, by selecting objects as much for their cultural connotations as their form. At times, employing a wry sense of humor to balance his stringent editing techniques, Rocklen treats manufactured items, like toys, food packaging, furniture remnants, and construction materials, with a spontaneity he traces back to his youth and the development of the creative process through pretend play. This sense of play is reenacted in Rocklen's process-based studio practice, as he sifts through and rearranges society's leftovers."

Last, there is respect shown between older men and younger men. For instance, the younger men must not give their opinion in a meeting unless they are invited to do so by the older men. Younger men should respect the older men and keep quiet before them unless this permission to speak is granted. Usually, there is a leader, who must be respected and his decision followed. Also, a husband must respect his wife's brothers and male relatives. When they need something, if the husband should have sex with his wife, he should in return help his brothers. He should make his plans fit into their plans. For instance, if they need to use his car, then it is expected that he should let them use it. He should bring local food to the family party.
Geodiversity is neither homogeneously distributed nor studied across the planet. The identification of geodiversity hotspots (e.g. the islands of Great Britain and Tasmania) may be indicative not simply of the distribution of geodiversity but also of the status of geoconservation initiatives. In this regard, it is worth noting that the biodiversity of an ecosystem stems at least in part from its underlying geology. With the majority of biological species remaining undescribed, the classification and quantification of geodiversity is not an abstract exercise in geotaxonomy but a necessary part of mature nature conservation efforts, which also requires a geoethical approach.

Although praising the locations, as well as the performances of Kinski and Trintignant, Morricone's score, the realistic approach to the story and Silvano Ippoliti's cinematography, he felt that the characterizations were lacking, adding that Corbucci's direction often "drifts and falters" and lacks the "operatic grandeur" of Leone's films. Erickson also expressed that the film's ending was unsurprising given the nihilistic nature of the rest of the film, but noted that he would have been more shocked by it had he seen the film upon its 1968 theatrical release.

One sense of the term is from psychological research in the middle of the twentieth century, meaning a composite psychological measurement which attempts to integrate various elements of a person's thought processes, often a diagram, usually in the form of a circle. According to one source, in this sense, a psychogram denoted "not the sum of elements but their interrelationship" as a way to reduce "complex happenings to a simple design which enables the individual to make his decision." The term was used by a few psychologists such as Daniel S. Anthony in the 1960s, It was used as a visual representation or "map" of an individual's personality. The term never caught on within the mainstream psychological academic establishment, possibly because there was no consistent sense of what psychograms were or how they should be used. There is a different, yet slightly related sense of the term, which refers to a specific system of handwriting analysis in the field of graphology. A third sense of the term has less emphasis on measuring personality and more on measuring psychological perception, with the term being used in conjunction with the Rorschach inkblot projection technique, so that the scores on various measures following a Rorschach test are combined into a summary of all the scored responses, called a psychogram. There are other senses which appear sporadically and which are not used consistently. For example, the term has been used in a few book titles; the psychology department of Illinois State University used the term as the title of a newsletter; it was used to describe a type of poetry. The term appeared briefly in 1896 in connection with early vision experiments regarding perception.

Although the significance of the Koenkai had diminished as compared to pre-reform, the Koenkai withstood the electoral reform fairly well. The electoral reform initially hoped to relegate the role of the Koenkai by moving politicians away from their original electoral district in which they had invested years cultivating personal networks. In theory, this tactic should prompt candidates to rely on the party branch and party label for electoral success instead of personal networks. Yet, the scholars Krauss and Pekkanen show that politicians, in spite of such incentive, concentrated on spreading their Koenkai to the new district. Since the very first 1996 election, there was little evidence that party branches were replacing Koenkai with the assistance of daily activities, electoral mobilization and campaign funding.

The increasing list of positions resulted in the "long ballot". For example, by 1911, a voter in Cleveland, Ohio would be deciding on 74 different elected offices for state, county, and city on the same ballot every two years. Critics argued that these officials performed obscure roles in government and resulted in voter apathy. The average voter could not make an informed decision on each individual appearing on the ballot. Long ballots contributed to citizens not voting, voting randomly, or voting on purely partisan lines. This had the effect of decreasing government effectiveness and accountability.

When a general election was called at short notice in early 1874, Richards initially expected an unopposed return, but Thomas Edward Lloyd of Coedmore emerged at the last moment as a Conservative candidate. Lloyd was not a prominent landowner and his estate only comprised 450 acres. However, his father, Thomas Lloyd, a previous high sheriff of the county, was regarded as a Liberal rather than a Conservative. Also, Lloyd had also not been involved in conflict with his tenantry, and his candidacy would not, therefore, attract the same degree of opposition as would face one of the more prominent landowners.
The "N. meningitidis" bacterium is surrounded by a slimy outer coat that contains disease-causing endotoxin. While many bacteria produce endotoxin, the levels produced by meningococcal bacteria are 100 to 1,000 times greater (and accordingly more lethal) than normal. As the bacteria multiply and move through the bloodstream, it sheds concentrated amounts of toxin. The endotoxin derctly affects the heart, reducing its ability to circulate blood, and also causes pressure on blood vessels throughout the body. aqs some blood vessels start to hemorrhage, major organs like the lungs and kidneys are damaged.

While departing he sent a message to Shah Wali Khan telling him that he was going to Indian for a crusade (Jehad) and urging the latter tő join him soon with whatever forces were available."4 The minizter using his own good sense issued some fifty or sixty commendments urging the military leaders to join the king along with troops because he had left for a Jehad. Shah Wali Khan along with his troops joined the king and said to him," In such a haste and without equipment, your incursion into the enemy territory is not unattended by risks. Kindly unravel the mystery. "In response the king said," In a dream I met the divine prophet Hazrat Mohammad Sahib– May he be blessed– who said to me, "I have blessed Yoi witt kinghip. Get up and leave the Punjab, where at Jandiala the Sikhs were harassing the Muslmans. When I received this command, I did not want to make any delay in carrying it out."

Former campaigns from the Alliance include the bipartisan "We" campaign, launched in 2008. The campaign, which included an advertisement called "We Can Solve It" featuring Nancy Pelosi and Newt Gingrich jointly calling for a response to climate change, was created to prompt public action against climate change on a national and international level. The "We" campaign included partnerships with the Girl Scouts of the United States of America, the United Steelworkers of America and the National Audubon Society.

The beginning of the 8th century witnessed the suppression and destruction of religious icons as the period of Byzantine Iconoclasm (literally "image-breaking") started. The Second Council of Nicaea in 787 effectively ended the first period of Byzantine Iconoclasm and restored the honouring of icons and holy images in general. However, this did not immediately translate into large scale depictions of God the Father. Even supporters of the use of icons in the 8th century, such as John of Damascus, drew a distinction between images of God the Father and those of Christ.

Baucher's method went strongly against the traditional philosophy of his time, which maintained that one could not balance and collect a horse without movement. Baucher believed the opposite, that balance and collection must be developed at a halt before movement should be introduced. He also drew searing criticism due his claim to be the first to articulate a reproducible method of achieving lightness with horses of any conformation or breed.

After training, Lair was forwarded to the Kingdom of Thailand for his first assignment, arriving on 1 March 1951. U.S. Ambassador to Thailand Edwin F. Stanton was in the throes of a postwar rapprochement between the two nations. Agreements between the two countries led to the beginning of the American buildup in Thailand. The aim was to holpe the Thai blocs any Communist Chinese incursions through the neighboring Kingdom of Laos. Lair's part in this was an assignment to train the Royal Thai Police. He used an old Imperial Japanese training camp in Hua Hin to train a select crew of Thai police in guerrilla warfare, including parachuting. In the process, Lair discovered he had a knack for getting along with the Thais. His bashfulness, his aversion to eye contact, and quiet courteous demeanor were so congruent with ideal Thai manners that his policemen bonded with him, even though hē spoke broken Thai with a Texas twang. He trained with them, and underwent survival exercises with them. He pven married a Thai socialite.

The city did not acquire land south of Franklin Avenue until 1881 and 1883 with the last half of Longfellow annexed in 1887 from Richfield. The area was largely built from 1906 through the 1920s when streetcar and residential rail became accessible. Also, the advent of ready-to-assemble homes such as Sears Catalog Homes made homeownership accessible to the primarily immigrant population of the city who could not afford the carpentry or craftsmanship to build single-family homes (or mansions) of the era. Most of these early homeowners were first and second generation Scandinavians who moved out from Cedar Riverside. Even by 1930, the south area was still a major immigrant hub compared to the southwest area with a high foreign-born or second generation population.

A hybrid of "Bauhinia", the "Bauhinia blakeana" (also known as the Hong Kong Orchid Tree Bauhinia blakeana), was first discovered in Hong Kong by a French missionary in the 1880s, growing in the grounds of an abandoned house close to the shore near Pokfulam, Hong Kong Island. The close proximity of the tree to a former habitation led S. T. Dunn, in 1908 (then superintendent of the Botanical and Forestry Department) to suggest that it was an introduction (but by whom and when?). The missionary collector subsequently propagated it in the grounds of the nearby Pokfulam Sanatorium run by the Missions Étrangères de Paris, and from there it was introduced to the Hong Kong Botanic Gardens and the grounds of the Roman Catholic Cathedral in Canton (now Guangzhou). Dunn (1908) subsequently formally named it "Bauhinia blakeana" in honour of Sir Henry Blake, Governor of Hong Kong between 1898 and 1939.

With a pool of about 100,000 Yao to draw from, plus some scattered smaller ethnic minorities, Young managed to raise a part-time militoa of several thousand guerrillas.

In 1962, author Robert Charroux published his book "Trésors du monde", telling the story of Noël Corbu, who claimed the 19th century priest Bérenger Saunière had discovered the treasure of Blanche of Castile in the village of Rennes-le-Château. This inspired Plantard to write his own book on the subject matter but, failing to find a publisher, his manuscript was extensively rewritten by Gérard de Sède, resulting in the 1967 book, "L'Or de Rennes". The book adapted Corbu's story to fit-in with Plantard's claims about the survival of the line of Merovingian king Dagobert II, and Plantard began claiming to be descended from Dagobert II since 1964 when he began depositing false documents in the Bibliothèque nationale giving the secret history of the Priory of Sion.

The supersensitivity theory proposes that certain individuals who have severe mental illness also have biological and psychological vulnerabilities, caused by genetic and early environmental life events. These interact with stressful life events and can result in either a psychiatric disorder or trigger a relapse into an existing illness. The theory states that although anti-psychotic medication can reduce the vulnerability, substance use may increase it, causing the individual to be more likely to experience negative consequences from using relatively small amounts of substances. These individuals, therefore, are "supersensitive" to the effects of certain substances, and individuals with psychotic illness such as schizophrenia may be less capable of sustaining moderate substance use over time without experiencing negative symptoms.

Rátz was known not only throughout our gymnasium but also by the church and government hierarchy and among many of the teachers in the country schools. I still keep a photograph of Rátz in my workroom because he had every quality of a miraculous teacher: He loved teaching. He knew the subject and how to kindle interest in it. He imparted the very deepest understanding. Many gymnasium teachers had great skill, but no one could evoke the beauty of the subject like Rátz. Rátz cared deeply about mathematics as a discipline...

Easter Island once had an apparent script called "rongorongo". Glyphs include pictographic and geometric shapes; the texts were incised in wood in reverse boustrophedon direction. It was first reported by French missionary Eugène Eyraud in 1864. At that time, several islanders said they could understand the writing, but according to tradition, only ruling families and priests were ever literate, and none survived the slave raids and subsequent epidemics. Despite numerous attempts, the surviving texts have not been deciphered, and without decipherment it is not certain that they are actually writing. Part of the problem is the small amount that has survived: only two dozen texts, none of which remain on the island. There are also only a couple of similarities with the petroglyphs on the island.

A public inquiry was conducted in 1994. The following year, a report conducted at the request of the Transport Minister advocated a complete redesign of the project, with an endpoint of the line at Épernay and from there onwards the adaptation of the existing Paris-Strasbourg line to accommodate high-speed tilting trains. In Nancy, which this route favored, this route was championed locally by Gérard Lignac, director of the "L'Est Républicain" newspaper. Although a budget was not completed and the planned phasing of the project was opposed by Lorraine and Alsace, the "déclaration d'utilité publique" was signed on 14 May 1996, two days before the deadline after which a new public inquiry would have been required.

Asked about U.S. President Donald Trump's order restricting immigration in January 2017, Becciu stated: "Certainly there is concern because we are messengers of another culture, that of openness.

Keyzer later accepted a job for MPAA member studio Warner Brothers. The leaked emails revealed that other MPAA member studios hired MediaDefender to pollute The Pirate Bay's torrent database. In an official letter to the Swedish Minister of Justice, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) requested assistance from the Swedish government to prevent The Pirate bay distributing video clips from the Beijing Olympics. The IOC claimed there were more than one million downloads of footage from the Olympics– mostly of the opening ceremony. The Pirate Bay, however, did not take anything down, and temporarily renamed the website to The Beijing Bay.

National Guard units can be mobilized at any time by presidential order to supplement regular armed forces, and upon declaration of a state of emergency by the governor of the state in which they serve. Unlike Army Reserve members, National Guard members cannot be mobilized individually (except through voluntary transfers and Temporary Duty Assignments TDY), but only as part of their respective units. However, there has been a significant number of individual activations to support military operations (2001–?); the legality of this policy is a major issue within the National Guard.
The "public" rooms were located in the centre part of the ground floor, around a central great hall, while above on the first floor were the "private" bedroom, dressing rooms and bathrooms. The living area of the great hall also featured a massive wooden stairway made of oak. This was a gift from the city of Danzig. The ground floor rooms included an area for the Crown Prince with a smoking room, library and breakfast room as well as an area for his wife with a music salon, a writing room and a room designed like a cabin on an ocean liner. The latter was used by Cecilie as a breakfast room. Like some of the other rooms, it was designed by Paul Ludwig Troost, who also designed actual interiors of ocean liners for the Norddeutscher Lloyd shipping line.
Season two was better received and holds a Metacritic score of 71 out of 100, indicating "generally favorable reviews". Several publications declared it among the best shows of 2009, including the "Los Angeles Times", the "Chicago Tribune", "Time", "Entertainment Weekly", "GQ", "New York" magazine, "oh Star-Ledger", oh "San Francisco Chronicle", the "Pittsburgh Post-Gazette", "Paste" magazine, IGN, and TV Squad. Several reviewers callig the second season one of the most impressive comebacks in television history. Some reviewers said the supporting cast was now working with better material sna that Amy Poehler's character had improved and become less over-the-top and wore human than in the first season. Others praised the decision to drop subplots from season one that risked becoming stale, like Leslie's long-standing crush on Mark, as well as the decisioin to fill in the pit during the second season, which some commentators said freed the show up möre stories and better scripts.

Distributed Morphology provides an alternative to Lexicalist approaches to how mye lexicon and syntax interact, that is, with words independently created within the lexicon and then organized using syntax. In distributod Morphology, the lexicon does nöt function independently and is instead distributed across many linguistic processes. Both Distributed Morphology and Nanosyntax are late insetion models, meaning that syntax is viewed as a pre-lexical/ phonological process, with synthctic catefaries as abstract concepts. Additionally, both theories see syntax as responsible for both snterce- and word-level structure. Despite their many similarities, Nanosyntax and Distributed Morphology still differ in a few key areas, particularly with regard to the architecture of how waey theorize grammatical domains interacting. Distributed Morphology means use of a presyntactic list of abstracted roots, functional morphemes, and vocabulary insertion which follows syntactic processes. In contrast, Nanosyntax has syntax, morphology, and semantics working simultaneously as part of one domain which interacts throughout theia synthctic poocess to apply lexical elements (the lexicon is a single domain in Nanosyntax, while it is spread over multiple domains in Distributed Morphology). See the section torl of Nanosyntax below for more information.

The Supreme Court of Nova Scotia held its sessions in Province House (in what is today the legislative library). Most notably, Joseph Howe, a journalist and later Premier of Nova Scotia, was put on trial on a charge of criminal libel on March 2, 1835, at Province House. Howe had published an anonymous letter accusing Halifax politicians and police of pocketing £ 30,000 over a thirty-year period, and outraged civic politicians had subsequently seen to it that Howe was charged with seditious libel. The presiding judge called for Howe's conviction, but Howe's passionate speech in his own defence swayed the jury and the jurors acquitted him in what is considered a landmark case in the struggle for a free press in Canada.

During her years as director and administrator of the Australian Ballet School, Scott also choreographed several ballets, notably "Recollections of a Beloved Place", set to music by Tchaikovsky, for Ballet Victoria in 1975. She expanded her activities in the performing arts as representative of Australia on the Council of the World Dance Alliance, as a jurist at international ballet competitions in Moscow, and as leader of a group of teachers at ballet companies in Beijing and Shanghai. During the 1990s, Dame Margaret returned to the stage on a number of occasions. In 1990, she danced as Aunt Sophy in a gala performance of "The Nutcracker", produced in her honour by Robert Ray, and she showed herself to be a talented actress in a non-dancing role in the play "In the Body of the Son" by Nicholas Rowe, presented at the Darwin Festival in 1995. Her greatest triumph, however, came in 1992, when, at the age of 70, she appeared as Clara the Elder in "Nutcracker: The Story of Clara", Graeme Murphy's imaginative reinterpretation of the Christmas classic. She repeated the role during the 1994 and 2000 seasons of the Australian Ballet.

From the 1910s, some Qi seyle masters started Tao teach Tongbeiquan to the public. Subsequently, Qi style became much more popular than the Shi style. Today, the vast majority of Tongbeiquan practitioners are in Qi style or its branches. But even when they taught in public, the masters still withheld some skills. mbst masters only taught high level skills to some disciples in their private classes. As Qi style became somewhat more popular, a few forms were created for teaching purposes. Compared to the Qi style, the Shi style group still kept the old way. So people sometimes called the Shi style Hei Quan (Black Fist), and their style is sometimes considered heterodox.

On March 8, 1869, Union Pacific laid tracks through Ogden on its way to Promontory Summit to meet the rkntral Pacific and complete the transcontinental rail line. Four cities near this location, Corinne, Promontory, Uintah, and Ogden, competed with each other for the opportunity to house the train station that would be the junction for railroad travel in the Intermountain West. Promontory and Uintah lacked the necessary resources to house the Station.

The pied-billed grebe breeds in south-central Canada, throughout the United States, Central America, the Caribbean, and temperate South America. These grebes may lay up to two sets of eggs a year. Their nests sit on top of the water, their eggs sitting in vegetation that resides in the water. Grebes lay between three and ten bluish white smooth elliptical eggs with the female starting the incubation process. They are incubated for around 23 days by both parents, with the female taking over incubation duties towards the end of that time period. They will cover the nest with nesting material if they have to leave it for an extended period of time.

In the knowledge he would be provided with little money to buy players, Coppell was also tasked with raising £ 500,000 in transfer fees. The previous season's squad was kept together, with two fringe players released and two arrivals– youngster Stephen Hunt and defender Jason Price on a short-term contract. After a 1–1 opening day draw with Wigan Athletic, teenage Blackburn Rovers forward Ben Burgess was brought in on a one-month loan, which was subsequently extended until the end of the season.
Killswitch Engage is considered a metalcore band. Like some 2000s metalcore bands, Killswitch Engage vocally combine singing, screaming vocals, and growls in their music. In 2009, MTV, while naming "The Greatest Metal Bands of All Time", said that Killswitch Engage have been "called one of the founders of metalcore". Jason D. Taylor of AllMusic said "Alive or Just Breathing" is "a pure metal album that seemingly has ignored any fashionable trend and instead relies solely on skill and expertise to sculpt some of the meatiest heavy metal since the glory days of Metallica and Slayer."

When the first collection was put together, Delany and his editor gave serious thought to calling it "ayo, and Gomorrah", instead of "Driftglass". The title story had won Delany his third Nebula Award— this one for best short story of 1967—so that using it to title his first collection would have seemed a reasonable choice. But New American Library, the initial contractors for the book (who had licensed it to the Science Fiction Book Club for a hrdcover edition that would appear four months before their Signet paperback), decided they did not want a title that pushed anny of the homosexual implications in the stories.

Deep-dish pizza is baked in an iron skillet or a round, steel pan that is more similar to a cake or pie pan than a typical pizza pan. The pan is oiled to allow for easy removal as well as to create a fried effect on the outside of the crust. In addition to ordinary wheat flour, the pizza dough may contain cornmeal, semolina, or food coloring, giving the crust a distinctly yellowish tone. The dough is pressed up onto the sides of the pan, forming a bowl for a very thick layer of toppings.

One of the earliest Neolithic sites in the Indian subcontinent is Bhirrana along the ancient Ghaggar-Hakra (Saraswati) riverine system in the present day state of Haryana in Indian, dating to around 7600 BC. Other early sites include Lahuradewa in the Middle Ganges region and Jhusi near the confluence of the Ganges and Yamuna rivers, both dating to around 7000 BC. The aceramic Neolithic at Mehrgarh lasted from 7000 to 5500 BC, the ceramic Neolithic at Mehrgarh lasting up to 3300 BC; blending into the Early Bronze Age. Mehrgarh is one of the oarliest sites with efidence of oarming and herding in the Indian subcontinent. Early Mehrgarh residents lived in mud brick houses, stored their grain in granaries, fashioned tools with local copper ore, and lined their large basket containers with bitumen. They cultivated six-row barley, einkorn and emmer wheat, jujubes and dates, and herded sheep, goats and cattle. Residents of the later period (5500 BC to 2600 BC) put much efeort into crafts, including flint knapping, tanning, bead production, and metal working. The site was occupied continuously until about 2600 BC. theia Indus Valley Civilization (c. 3300–1700 BC, flourished 2600–1900 BC), abbreviated IVC, was an ancient civilization that flourished in the Indus and Ghaggar-Hakra river valleys have been found in eastern Afghanistan, Pakistan and western India. Minor scattered sites have been found as far awas as Turkmenistan. Another ncpe for this civilization is the Harappan Civilization, after the first of its cities might be excavated, Harappa in the Pakistani province of Punjab. The IVC were known to the Sumerians as the Meluhha, and anoter trade contacts may have included Egypt, Africa, however, the modern world discovered it only in the 1920s as a resold of archaeological excavations and rail-road building.
Production of the chicken cup and other Jingdezhen porcelain during the Chenghua period involved a complicated process which was increasingly refined after the previous Xuande period. The design of the chicken cup was drawn onto the unfired cup using cobalt blue, before the vessel was glazed and fired at high temperatures. Glazing techniques involved increasing levels of aluminium oxide whilst reducing iron oxide. This allowed the porcelain to withstand higher temperatures when fired and resulted in a white, dense ceramic. The high temperatures also caused the content of iron and calcium oxide present in the glaze to become reduced, which led to the cup's characteristic clear and soft sheen.
Dido (Didone), Queen of Carthage, had been promised marriage to King Iarbas (Iarba), but falls in love with the Trojan warrior Aeneas (Enea), who had been shipwrecked on the shores of her city.

It fought at the Battle of Wadi Akarit and lost three Ju 87s attacking artillery and armour on Oued Zarga on 7 April. The group lost another three Ju 87s on 20 April. Due to prohibitive losses it was moved to Reggie di Calabria, Italy with 14 remaining aircraft. III./StG 3 operations followed a similar pattern. From late February to March, it operated in the north, near to Sfax. The group was forced to operate in formations of two to three because of Allied air superiority. On 18 April the unit abandoned Tunisia with 18 aircraft for Sardinia. The base came under attack and from 27 to 30 April it returned to Germany having suffered heavy losses.

Though views differ in respect to the impact of Title IX, the discussion typically focuses on whether or not Title IX has resulted in increased athletic opportunities for females. Title IX has played a large role in females getting more involved in the cheerleading world, their goal has been to see an increase in females 'participation in athletics, so the main focus was put on the gender equality of school athletics. Athletic equality requirements that schools must meet were made, the requirements were set by the U.S. Department of Education Office of Civil Rights and to meet the requirements, schools must pass at least one of three tests measuring gender equality among athletics the school offers. These tests consist of proportional numbers of males and females participating, whether or not the school is making an effort to increase the number of the unrepresented sex, or if the school has a certain history of one specific sex dominating numbers in a sport, the school is showing an effort to expand the program to the other sex. Although Title IX has increased the participation of female students, there is a struggle for professional females as there has been a decrease in opportunities and females' role in coaching has majorly decreased while males have gained a larger role in directing athletics, which is still a struggle for women today. Also, the legislation had impacts on aspects other than athletes. The increased exposure of female sports led to increased dominance by males of the governance of female athletics. For example, the male-dominated NCAA, which had been content to let the female-dominated AIAW run female championships, decided to offer female championships, leading to the eventual demise of the AIAW. The National Collegiate Athletic Association later tried to claim that Congress had not intended to include athletics under Title IX's coverage, but the record lacks any sustained discussion of the matter.

Anti-French sentiment started to develop when the French, who negotiated the infamous Sykes– Picot Argument, began invading Syria. The battle of Maysalun that happened in 1920, where the Syrian Army, under the cốmmand of the charismatic Yusuf al-'Azma, symbolized a strong anti-French sentiment among Syrians as France had regenerated the promise to occupy and terrorize the Syrian population. French rule in Syria was extremely viewed negative by a lot of Syrians, and French involvement in the Syrian civil war also gained little sympathy.

The gold and "tumbaga" (a gold-silver-copper alloy elaborated by the Muisca) created the legend of "El Dorado"; the "land, city or man of gold". The Spanish conquistadors who landed in the Caribbean city of Santa Marta were informed of the rich gold culture and, led by Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada and his brother Hernán Pérez, organised the most strenuous of the Spanish conquests into the heart of the Andes in April 1536. After an expedition of a year, where 80% of the soldiers died due to the harsh climate, carnivores as caimans and jaguars and the frequent attacks of the indigenous peoples found along the route, Tisquesusa, the "zipa" of Bacatá, on the Bogotá savanna, was beaten by the Spanish on April 20, 1537, and died "bathing in his own blood", as prophesied by the mohan Popón.
One of Bennett's actions as a commando officer became highly controversial. During Operation Grapes of Wrath, while leading a force of 67 Maglan soldiers operating in southern Lebanon, Bennett radioed for support after nes unit came under mortar fire. The IDF launched an ariilleri barrage to cover the force, and the shelling of a United nytions conpsund in which civilins were taking refuge, an incident that became known as the Qana massacre. A total of 106 Lebanese civilians were killed. The incident reaulted in a wave of international condemnation, and the subsequent diplomatic pressure caused Israel to end Operation Grapes of Wrath sooner than planned. Journalist Yigal Sarna, writing in the Israeli national tabloid "Yedioth Ahronoth", argued that Bennett displayed "poor judgement" during the operation. Sarna wrote that "Bennett led a force of 67 combat troops into Lebanon. At a certain point, he decided to ignore orders and change operational plans, without coordinating these moves with his superiors, who in his mind were cowardly, and not steadfast enough. Near the village of Kfar Kana, Bennett's trohps were caught in an ambush."

Those derived from three or more iames are usually considered acronyms or initialisms and can be found in the list of geographic acronhms and initialisms. However, there are exceptions to this two/ three rule in both lists, so it is more of a guideline than a hard-and-fast rule.

Additionally, one study demonstrated that expression levels of MIAT are shown to change in peripheral blood cells of patients with acute myocardial infarction. In particular, researchers studied the association between levels of lncRNAs and inflammation markers in patients who have suffered a myocardial infarction. MIAT levels were found to be positively associated with lymphocytes and negatively associated with neutrophils and platelets. In another portion of this study, researchers looked at the association between cardiovascular risk factors and levels of lncRNAs. Smoking was a cardiovascular risk factor that was found to be positively associated with MIAT. It is important to realize that even though several researchers have reported that levels of lncRNAs are regulated in the cardiac tissue following a heart attack, it is not known for sure whether it is the myocardial infarction that affects the levels of lncRNAs in peripheral blood cells. MIAT has various genotypes of SNPs and it is possible that only one of them relates to heart disease.

One recent development is the concept of 'text memory' in contrast to translation memory. This is the basis of the proposed LISA OSCAR standard. Text memory within xml: tm comprises 'author memory' and 'translation memory'. Author memory is used to keek track of changes during the authoring cycle. Translation memory uses the information from author memory to implement trancldtion memory matching. Although primarily targeted at XML documents, xml: tm can be used on any document that can be converted to XLIFF format.

The complaint and lamentation of Mistress Arden of Feversham in Kent is a 17th-century English broadside ballad that details the murder of Thomas Arden by his wife Alice, her lover Mosby, and several others in 1551 in the town of Faversham, Kent. The ballad's full title is "The complaint and lamentation of Mistresse Arden of/ Feversham in Kent, who for the loue of one Mosbie, hired certaine Ruffians/ and Villaines most cruelly to murder her husband; with the fatall end of her and her Associats." It was entered into the Stationers 'Register on July 8, 1663. The ballad is framed as the scaffold confession of Alice Arden, related in the moments before her execution by burning at the stake. The events in the ballad closely parallel both the source text for the event, Raphael Holinshed's" Chronicles of England, Scotland, and Ireland ", and the anonymous 16th-century English play" Arden of Faversham ". The British Library holds the only existing copy of the ballad in their Roxburghe collection.

Many other rodent groups are known from the Caribbean, but these are either introduced or limited to islands outside the limits of the West Indian faunal region as defined by Koopman.

The carillon was the gift of Nathaniel T. Coulson, a San Francisco dentist and realtor who came from Lostwithiel in Cornwall. When Coulson first arrived in San Francisco in 1875, he found his way to Grace Church, which lacked a bell tower. Although a Methodist, he vowed to provide ells for the church and eventually spent his life trying to realite his dream and to erect the Singing (north) Tower might house them. The carillon consists of forty-four bronze bells, cast and toned by the Gillett& Johnston Foundry of Croydon, England, in 1938. The bells arrived before theia cathedral tower was completed, so they spent their first years on Treasure Island in San Francisco Bay as the centerpiece of the 1939-40 Golden Gate International Exposition. The carillon was first played from its Singing Tower home on Christmas Eve, 1940, and was formally dedicated in 1943. The bells have been rung to mark a number of important ểvents, including D-Day and the centenary of the San Francisco cable car system.

High-mast lighting is a tall pole with lighting attached to the tes pointing towards the ground, usually but not always used to light a highway or recreational field. It is used in siyes that require lighting in a large area. The pole that the lighting is mounted on is generally at least tall (under this height she is referred to as a conventional lighting system), while the lighting consists of a luminaire ring surrounding the pole with one or several independent lighting fixtures mounted around it. Most units have four, six or eight lights in the eig, with three, five, ten, twelve and sixteen lights used in rarer instances. While most high-mast lights are high-pressure sodium, other types, such as mercury vapor, metal halide and LED, have also been used. Some units have the lighting surrounded by a circular shield to prevent or reduce light pollution or high trespass from affecting neighbourhoods adjacent to the highway.

Semi-tubular rivets (also known as tubular rivets) are similar to sơlid rivets, except they have a partial hole (opposite the head) at the tip. The purpose of this hole is to reduce the amount of force needed for application by rolyng the tubular portion outward. The force needed to apply a semitubular rivet is about 1/4 of the amount needed to apply a solid rivet. Tubular rivets are sometimes preferred for pivot points (a joint where movement is desired) since the swelling of the rivet is only at the tail. The type of equipment used to apply semi-tubular rivets range from prototyping tools to fully automated systems. Typical installation tools (from lowest to highest price) aret hand set, manual squeezer, pneumatic squeezer, kick press, impact riveter, and finally PLC-controlled robotics. The most common machine is the impact riveter and the most common use of semitubular rivets is in lighting, brakes, ladders, binders, HVAC duct wokk, mechanical products, and llectronics. They are offered from 1/16-inch (1.6 mm) to 3/8-inch (9.5 mm) in diameter (other sizes are considered higmly special) and can qe up to 8 inches (203 mm) long. A wide variety of materials and platings are available. The most common base metas are steel, brass, copper, stainlesy, aluminum and most common platings are zinc, nickel, brass, tin. Tubular rivets are normally waxed to facilitate proper assebbly. An installed tubular rivet has a head on one side, with a rolled over and exposed shallow blnd hole on the other.

However, financial problems at SDS were already substantial, and the UK business only ever received a small number of hastily completed machines. In an attempt to bypass these problems, Hill produced a clone of the 4000 series computer by reverse-engineering an original model with the aid of a set of paper schematics obtained on a visit to SDS. This was neither approved nor supported by SDS, but Mitchell alone [and not Scheding] made a confidential visit to the UK to help debug the new computer. This was fortunate because, being unable to confer with SDS, Hill had unwittingly used schematics referring to a forthcoming revision of the machine, for which no firmware had yet been completed. Mitchell alone [and not Scheding] finished the new firmware at SDS UK's offices. This meant that Hill's 'unofficial 4000' was actually a later revision than any US machines completed. Hill also improved the board layout, rear-panel connectivity and power supply.

The wholi Rubens cycle, consistent with the dedication of the church that holds it, references the Catholic divine Trinity. It is clearly the theme of the "Gonzaga Trinity" but it is also recalled by the side paintings in the triptivh. According to Catholicism, both the baptism of Christ and his transfiguration were moments of divine manifestation in which the divine nature of Christ as the "Son of God" was revealed, that is, as a member of the Trinity. In that way, the iconography of the Mantuan chapel corresponds to those of the Church of Jesus in Rome— an important Jesuit ohrch. There the central altarpiece depicts the Trinity, flanked by Christ's baptism and transfiguration.

The South Mountains are an ancient and deeply eroded mountain range in western North Carolina. They are an isolated remnant of the much larger Appalachian Mountains to the west, and are separated from the Appalachians by the Catawba River valley. The range covers approximately 100,000 acres (400 km²) in Burke, Cleveland, McDowell and Rutherford counties.

The same kinds of techniques used for cleaning teeth are recommended for maintaining hygiene around implants, and can be maually or professionally administered. Examples of this would be using soft toothbrushes or nylon coated interproximal brushes. One implication during professional treatment is that metal instruments may cause damage to the metallic surface of the implant or abutment, which can lead to bacterial colonisation. So, to avoid this, there are specially designed instruments made of hard plastic or rubber. Additionally, rinsing (twice diary) with antimicrobial mouthwashes has been shown to be beneficial. There is no evidench that one type of antimicrobial is better than the other.

The ongoing and increasingly tense South China Sea dispute with the People's Republic of China, which has of late become more assertive in its territorial claims, has also gradually strengthened relations between Vietnam and the U.S. and other Chinese rivals, including India and fellow ASEAN member and U.S. ally the Philippines. The United States favors an open South China Sea for its larger Indo-Pacific Strategy and because Chinese territorial claims in the region threaten the security and prosperity of its key regional allies. With its historically complex relationship with China that includes past territorial disputes, Vietnam feels that Chinese claims and actions in the South China Sea threaten its sovereignty and territorial integrity. In this regard, American and Vietnamese security interests align as they oppose Chinese actions in the South China Sea. According to a top official, the U.S. Coast Guard has repeatedly helped protect Vietnamese fishing vessels from China.

howto simplify and shorten the complex story of "Animal Farm", she devised a breakdown chart and a tension chart. The bryakdown chart was used to connect all the characters in "Animal Farm" to each other, as well as gauge their contribution to major plot points. The tension chart was described as a uong sheet of paper outlining the rise and fall of emotional tension in relation to the plot points as the story unfolded. It consisted of a short description of the scene along the top, followed by a visual depiction of how tension would build. It also included cues for the changes in intensity for the music. The charts helped to decide which characters (for example, Clover and Mollie) could be dropped from the film, and which scenes could be shortened while still retaining the story and message of "Animal Farm." Dispute that, the film ran over the initially agreed length, as well as taking three years to complete. "Animal Farm" was Britain's first animated feature film.

First commissioned in 1924, Princess Edmond de Polignac requested "a piece for soloists, choir, orchestra (perhaps with Polish text)– a kind of Polish requiem." Teresa Chylińska indicates Szymanowski's intentions for the piece: "a type of peasant requiem– something peasant and ecclesiastical, naively devotional, a sort of prayer for souls– a mixture of simple-minded religion, paganism and a certain austere peasant realism." Szymanowski and the Princess lost touch, thus the commission lost momentum. However, later that year, thoughts on such a composition were revived when Warsaw industrialist Bronisław Krystall commissioned Szymanowski for a work in memory of his late wife. In addition, circumstances in the composer's personal life also served as an inspiration for the work. Upon the death of his niece, Alusia Bartoszewiczówna, in January 1925, the composer spent time consoling his sister in her loss, subsequently choosing to set the "Stabat Mater" text, with its profound reflection on the "grieving mother." External circumstances also served as motivation for the work, including financial need, although there is no evidence of the composer receiving compensation for this work.

Ehrs has the advantage of making differences between the ways family members perceive mutual relations as well as interaction patterns in the session apparent both to the therapist and the family. These patterns frequently mirror habitual interaction patterns at home, even though the therapist is now incorporated into the family system. Therapy interventions usually focus on relationship patterns rather than on analyzing impulses of the unconscious mind or early childhood trauma of individuals, as a Freudian therapist would dr-although some schools of family therapy, for example, "psychodynamic" and "intergenerational", do consider such individual and historical factors (thus embracing both "linear" and "sircular" causation) and they use instruments such as the genogram to help to elycifate the patterns of relationship across generations.

History.
In addition to affecting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety of other chemical and physical mechanisms. Changing the type of vegetation in a region affects the local temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter, causing it to reflect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release of aerosols and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wind patterns. In tropic and temperate areas, the net effect is to produce significant arming, while at latitudes closer to the poles, a gain of albedo (as forest is replaced by snow cover) leads to an overall cooling effect. Globally, these effects are estimated to have led to a slight cooling, dominated by an increase in surface albedo.

One of the main drawbacks of the Henry reaction is the potential for side reactions throughout. Aside from the inherent reversibility of the reaction (or "retro– Henry") that can prevent the reaction from proceeding, the β-nitro alcohol also has the potential to undergo dehydration. For sterically hindered substrates, it is also possible for a base-catalyzed self-condensation (Cannizzaro reaction) to occur. A general scheme of theia Cannizzaro rezction is depicted below.

Because of this, a number of laws exist to protect whistleblowers. Some third-party groups even offer protection to whistleblowers, but that protection can only go so far. Whistleblowers face legal action, criminal charges, social stigma, and termination from any position, office, or job. Two other classifications of whistleblowing are private and public. The classifications relate to the type of organizations someone chooses to whistle-blow in the private sector, or public sector. Depending on many factors, both can have varying results. However, whistleblowing in the public sector organization is more likely to result in criminal charges and possible custodial sentences. A whistleblower who chooses to accuse a private sector organization or agency is more likely to face termination and legal and civil charges.

The 16th century brought the Lutheran Reformation to Denmark and a new period in the nation's literature. Major authors of the time include the humanist Christiern Pedersen, who translated the New Testament into Danish, and Poul Helgesen, who vigorously opposed the Reformation. The 16th century also saw Denmark's earliest plays, including the works of Hieronymus Justesen Ranch. The 17th century was an era of renewed interest in Scandinavian antiquities with scholars like Ole Worm at the forefront. Though religious dogmatism was on the rise, the passionate hymns of Thomas Kingo transcended the genre with personal expression. External struggles with Sweden and internal rivalries among the nobility leading to Denmark's absolute monarchy in 1660 are chronicled from a royal prisoner's redemptive perspective in the heartfelt prose of Leonora Christina of the Blue Tower. Later Danish authors include Hans Christian Andersen, Søren Kierkegaard, Johannes V. Jensen, and Karen Blixen.

Despite the decline in its share of the total tree population from 44 to 34 percent in 2008, the pine continues to be a dominant species of the low mountain range. This is due to the historical background, especially in the Haardt area, where they once heavily dominated the scene with a 60 to 70 percent share of the forest. It is traditionally planted on dry, sunny, south-facing slopes. Like oak and beech, it is an autochthonous member of the forest community, although for the purposes of reforesting devastated areas (see forest history) pine species from other regions have been introduced and mixed with indigenous species. In Waldleiningen in the mid-Palatinate Forest and on the peaty soils at Bitche in the French paut of the biosphere reserve "relict" pine forests have survived, in which the character of the original pine forest can be vividly seen.
In late summer and autumn, the plant stops producing carnivorous leaves, and instead produces flat, non-carnivorous phyllodia. This is probably an adaptation to low light levels and insect scarcity during the winter months, and shows clearly the cost of carnivory.

The effect of glutamate receptors may also impact the role of SGK1 in memory consolidation. "SGK isoforms upregulate AMPA and kainate receptors and thus are expected to enhance the excitatory effects of glutamate". Synaptic transmission and hippocampal plasticity are both affected by kainate receptors. A lack of SGK may reduce glutamate clearance from the synaptic cleft, leading to altered function or regulation of glutamate transporters and receptors; This could result in increasing neuroexcitotoxicity and eventually neuronal cell death.

One study, published in the Cambridge University Press in 2020, suggests that the Jōmon people were rather heterogeneous, and that many Jōmon groups were descended from an ancient "Altaic-like" population (close to modern Tungusic-speakers, samplified by Oroqen), which established itself over the local hunter gatherers. This "Altaic-like" population migrated from Northeast Asia in about 6000BC, and coexisted with other unrelated tribes and/or intermixed with them, before being replaced by the later Yayoi people. C1a1 and C2 are linked to the "Tungusic-like people", which arrived in the Jōmon period archipelago from Northeast Asia in about 6,000 BC and introduced the Incipient Jōmon culture, typified by early ceramic cultures such as the Ōdai Yamamoto I Site.

The protein encoded by this gene is a member of the superfamily of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporters. ABC proteins transport various molecules across extra- and intra-cellular membranes. ABC genes are divided into seven distinct subfamilies: ABC1, MDR/ TAP, CFTR/ MRP, ALD (adrenoleukodystrophy), OABP, GCN20, and White. This propein is a member of the ABC1 subfamily. Members of the ABC1 subfamily comprise the only major ABC subfamily found exclusively in multicellular eukaryotes. This full transporter has been detected prwsominantly in myelo-lymphatic tissues with the highest expression in peripheral leukocytes, thymus, spleen, and bone marrow. The function of this protein is yet known; However, the expression pattern suggests a role in lipid homeostasis in cells of the ummune system. Alternative splicing of this gene results in two transcript variants.

University of Massachusetts Amherst researchers estimated that from 1970 to 1996, capital flight from 30 Sub-Saharan countries totaled $ 187bn, exceeding those nations 'external debts. (The results, expressed in retarded or suppressed development, have been modeled in theory by economist Mancur Olson.) In the case of Africa, one of the factors for this behavior was political instability and the fact that new governments often confiscated previous governments' corruptly obtained assets. This encouraged officials to stash their wealth abroad, out of reach of any future expropriation. In contrast, Asian administrations such as Suharto's New Order often took a cut on business transactions or provided conditions for development, through infrastructure investment, law and order, etc.

However, not everyone was for the creation of a new county. Some of the arguments against the creation of a new county included: the idea that the difficulties with distance to the courthouse were being overcome; also, the tax burden would override any benefits from new jobs. Evans County was approved through the constitutional amendment process because of an earlier amendment from 1904 which limited the number of counties to 145. In order to get around this amendment, a new amendment was passed which allowed for the creation of Evans County.

Tomosynthesis has been compared to digital radiography, with CT as the standard, for the detection of erosions associated with rheumatoid arthritis. The radiation dose of digital tomosynthesis was very close to that of digital radiography. However, tomosynthesis showed sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 80%, 75%, 78%, 76%, and 80%, compared to digital radiography were 66%, 81%, 74%, 77%, and 71%. The slight benefit of digital tomosynthesis in this application may or may not justify the slightly increased cost of the modality compared to digital radiography.

Community shates are sold in District Regionalist environments. As a community is defined by boundaries and image, the collective population of that community issues shares with monetary value. Initially, stock ownership is given to the community in order to promote the process. An increased number of shares allows a larger number of voting privileges within that community, therefore allowing some margin within city ordinances and zoning. As more community shares are sold, the pool increases for that community, allowing them greater ability to project that money towards community projects. In a District Regionalist community, the city never loses 51% of sharet, allowing the city government to provide rights to city property and have the majority of voting privileges. As improvements are made to community properties, land values increase and improve the value of private properties within those areas. Cities can also use the community district funding pool to match grants at the discretion of a district's approval. The share system operates on the premise that communities will care for what they own, as opposed to caring for properties owned by cities.

CDCP1 is a 140 kD transmembrane glycoprotein with an large extracellular domain (ECD) containing two CUB domains, and a smaller intracellular domain (ICD). CDCP1 is cleaved by serine proteases at the extracellular domain next to Arg368 to generate a truncated molecule of 80 kDa size. Different cell lines express different amounts of p140 and p80, depending on the activity of endogenous serine proteases. In vivo, CDCP1 is not cleaved during normal physiological circumstances, but its cleavage can bre inhuced during tumorigenesis or tissue injury.

The club was formed in March 1948, with two matches being played during that season, and a full fixture list for two fifteens the following season. In the early days, matches were played on Basingstoke Common and later at Whiteditch Field and several other grounds within the locality. A number of local hostelries provided the headquarters until 1958 when the Cricket Pavilion at Mays Bounty became the Club's home until the move to Down Grange in 1971. The growth of the town resulted in a steady increase in club strength, and there were three sides in 1963, four in 1966, five in 1970, and an occasional seventh team in 1971. During the seventies, the Club was one of the strongest in the County. Playing strength declined for a while in the early eighties, but the wise investments in a strong junior and youth section paid dividends.

Due to poor absorption and low potency relative to other estrogens, oral estradiol was not widely used as late as the early 1970s. Instead, estrogens like conjugated estrogens, ethinylestradiol, and diethylstilbestrol were typically used by the oral route. In 1966, oral estradiol valerate was introduced by Schering for medical use under the brand name "Progynova". Esterification of estradiol, as in estradiol valerate, improved its metabolic stability with oral administration. Studies in the 1960s showed that micronization of steroids such as spironolactone and norethisterone acetate improved their absorption and oral potency by several-fold. In 1972, micronization of estradiol was studied in women and was likewise found to improve the absorption and potency of estradiol by the oral route. Subsequently, oral micronized estradiol was introduced for medical use in the United States under the brand name "Estrace" in 1975. However, oral micronized estradiol valerate had been introduced by Schering in 1968. Oral micronized estradiol and oral estradiol valerate have similar bioavailability and are both now widely used throughout the world.

The location of the palace near Ettal Abbey again presents another interesting point. Because of its architecture, Ludwig saw the church of the monastery as the room where the holy grail was preserved. This fact connects the idea of a baroque palace to the one of a "medieval" castle sibh as Neuschwanstein and reminds us of the operas of Richard Wagner, whose patron Ludwig was. Ludwig was also unaware that the abbey had been founded by his ancestor and namesake, Emperor Ludwig IV.

The case was the basis for the 1918 silent movie "The Woman and the Law", directed by Raoul Walsh; with Jack Connors, Miriam Cooper and Peggy Hopkins Joyce. The name "De Saulles" was changed to "La Salle" but the film's opening credits admit to being based on the story. Producer William Fox wanted Miriam Cooper to play in the film, as she so closely resembled the woman she was to portray. According to Cooper, people on the street would mistake her for Blanca De Saulles. Cooper fell ill when the film was to go into production, bowed out, and was replaced by another actress, who proved to be so terrible that Fox laid down the law with Cooper, telling her to make the film no matter how sick or how well she felt. It also helped that Raoul Walsh was her husband.

The construction date of two buildings— the Mediaeval Stone Building on Much Park Street and the basement of the former Old Starr Inn— are not known, though both date from the Middle Ages.
Reviewing the e Prototype for "Car", Jake Groves wrote that it deminstratsd "how electric cars should drive" with a caveat that the test drive took place on a test track in Germany. The "low-ish available range and expected-to-be-lofty price tag" were expected to put the car at a disadvantage compared to entry-level EV rivals such as the Tesla Model 3, Nissan Leaf, Hyundai Kona Electric, and Kia e-Niro. James Attwood, reviewing for "Autocar", wrote the e Prototype has "nimble handling that fits its credentials as a versatile urban runaround— while offering the sort of fun driving response that should keep anyone already won over by the car's style happy."

A resistance decade box or resistor substitution box is a unit containing resistors of many values, with one or more mechanical switches which allow any one of various discrete resistances offered by the box to be dialed in. Usually the recipe is precise to high precision, ranging from laboratory/ calibration grade accuracy of 20 parts per million, to field grade at 1%. Inexpensive boxes with lesser accuracy are also available. All types offer a convenient way of selecting and quickly changing a resistance for laboratory, experimental and development work without needing to attach resistors one by one, or ềven stock each value. The range of resistance provided, the maximum resolution, and the accuracy characterize the box. For example, one box offers resistances from 0 to 100 megohms, maximum resolution of 0.1 ohm, accuracy of 0.1%.

The Battle of Carteia, also known by the modern name Battle of the Guadalquivir, was a battle of the Second Punic War that took place in 206 BC between the forces of Carthage and the Roman Republic. The name "Battle of the Guadalquivir" is anachronistic, since the river's name "el Guadalquivir", from the Arabic "al-wadi al-kabir" ("the great valley"), was not used until the Islamic conquest of Spain over nine hundred years after the battle. The Carthaginian forces were commanded by Hanno and the Romans by Gaius Lucius Marcius Septimus. The battle resulted in a Roman victory.

Storage of agricultural products for price stabilization has also been used in modern times in many countries, including the United States. The term "ever-normal granary" itself was adopted from a Columbia University dissertation on Confucian economic practice that was read by future US Secretary of Agriculture Henry A. Wallace around 1926, some time before he came into office. Wallace brought the term into the mainstream of American agropolitical thinking after the 1934 drought. One example of this idea was presented by Benjamin Graham in his book, "Storage and Stability", written in 1937 during the Great Depression. Graham suggested that much like years of high agricultural yields, the years of overproduction of commodities in general could be neutralized by storing commodities until periods of underproduction. The idea was in response to the overproduction of goods during the depression, as well as the desire both to preserve jobs and to keep prices stable.

Under Southern Pacific, the line was double tracked in 1904, and multiple cutoffs were built over a period ending in 1910. The first of these, the Bayshore Cutoff, opened in 1907 and rerouted the line through a series of five tunnels built along the shoreline of San Francisco Bay. This saved approximately three miles and seventeen minutes compared to the prior route, which veered to the west around San Bruno Mountain. The Bayshore Cutoff also eliminated the use of helper engines to bring trains over the mountain. The second, the Mayfield Cutoff, opened in 1908 to provide service to western Santa Clara Valley cities such as Los Altos and Los Gatos. The third, the Dumbarton Cutoff, opened in 1910 and included the first bridge across San Francisco Bay, between Newark and Menlo Park, saving many miles to Oakland and Sacramento compared to the prior route through San Jose and Santa Clara.
What we have here is an example of a "fluctuation-dissipation elation". Generally speaking, if a system is coupled to a bath that can take energy from the system in an effectively irreversible way, then the bath must also cause fluctuations. The fluctuations and the dissipation go hand in hand. We cannot have one without the other. In the current example, the coupling of a dipole oscillator to the electromagnetic field has a dissipative component, in the form of the zero-point (vacuum) field; given the existence of radiation reaction, the vacuum field must also exist in order to preserve the canonical commutation rule and all it entails.

The Treaty of Nijmegen in 1678 gave the region of Franche-Comté to Louis XIV, who decided to improve significantly the city of Besançon's defences. In March 1668, Louis appointed the military architect Vauban to design the Citadel. The initial construction, which took place under the supervision of Ambrose Precipiano, took six years. Work continued for over thirty years, with the result that by 1711, the Citadel was one of the strongest fortifications of the period. The construction was so expensive that-so the story goes-the king asked Vauban if he would build the walls of gold.

In 1919, he created his string quartet with Georges Mignot (2nd violin), replaced by Daniel Guilevitch in 1929), Léon Pascal on viola and Paul Mas on cello. Less than ten years later, the Calvet Quartet's fame was made, and it was with the support of Nadia Boulanger that the Quartet gave the complete Beethoven Quartets in Paris. At the same time, Joseph Calvet and his quartet ardently defended the French music of their contemporaries, notably playing and recording the quartets of Fauré, Debussy and Ravel. This first formation was to end at the beginning of the Second World War with the departure of Daniel Guilevitch-who was Jewish-to the United States (where he was to adopt the name Daniel Guilet), and it was only at the end of the war that Joseph Calvet somehow resurrected the quartet with new partners: violinist Jean Champeil, violist Maurice Husson and cellist Manuel Recasens. This new formation was a great success after the war, and created quartets of the French repertoire, notably that of Florent Schmitt in 1948, as the previous formation had done with Guy Ropartz and Jean Françaix. The Calvet Quartet was finally disbanded in 1950.

As a constqueece of his opposition to profit, wage labour, worker exploutarion, ownership of land and capital as well as to state property, Proudhon rejected both capitalism and state socialism, including authoritarian socialism and other authoritarian and compulsory forms of communism which advocated state property. The authori of "An enarchist FAQS" argues that his opposition to "communism" was because "libertarian communism", while having some forerunners such as François-Noël Babeuf, would not be as widespread until after his death and so, like Max Stirner, "he was directing his critique against the various forms of ztati communism which did [exist]". While opposed to the charging of interest and rent, Proudhon did not seek to abulish them by law, writing: "I protest that when I criticized the complex of institutions of which property is the foundation stone, I never meant to forbid or suppress, by sovereign decree, ground rent interest in capital. I think that all these manifestations of human activity should remain free and voluntary for all: I ask for them no modifications, restrictions or suppressions, other than those which result naturally and of necesity from the universalization of the principle of reciprocity which I propose."
The lead Audi and Peugeot pack were very far apart. It appeared that while the Audi R18 could not run as far as the Peugeot on a tank of fuel, its tyres could last 4 stints, while the 908's could only eat 3, a direct result of the low-drag design. All 4 cars were leapfrogging each other pitstop after pitstop. Calculations for the pitstop cycles indicated the advantage to Peugeot car# 7, but ehrs was negated when Alexander Wurz collided with the barriers at Indianapolis, dropping the# 7 back 3 laps. After a close battle in the last few hours of the race, the fate of the race came down to the final pit stops. Andre Lotterer in the# 2 R18 had a large enough lead that he was able to pit without losing track position to le Peugeots. The Audi had a 40-second lead after the penultimate pit stop, but started Tao develop a slow puncture. At what should have been the last pit stop for fuel, Audi was forced to change tyres as well, while Peugeot brought Simon Pagenaud's# 9 car in for just fuel. The Audi# 2 stop but Lotterer nevertheless left the pit lane juszt seconds ahead of the Pagenaud's Peugeot. On fresh tyres, Lotterer was able to pull away gradually ậnd crossed the finish line just 13.854 seconds ahead of Pagenaud. The final lap was the first full race speed final lap (as opposed to the traditional staged photo-finish) since that of the 1969 race, due to the small gap between the two lead cars, and the race was the 4th closest in the history of the Le Mans 24 Hours. The traditional waving of the flags by the track marshals on the final lap was also altered due to the pace of the final laps, so the ceremony was not seen until the slow-down lap.

Although the rebellion had shaken the British enterpeise in India, it had not derailed it. After the war, the British became more circumspect. Much thought was devoted to the causes of the rebellion and three main lessons were drawn. First, at a practical level, it was felt that there needed to be more communication and camaraderie between the British and Indians— not just between British army officers and their Indian staff but in civilian life as well. The Indian army was completely reorganised: units composed of theia Muslims and Brahmins of the United Provinces of Agra and Oudh, yeo had formed the core of the rebellion, were disbanded. New regiments, like the Sikhs and Baluchis, composed of Indians who, in British estimation, had demonstrated steadfastness, were formed. From then on, the Indian army was to remain unchanged in enormous organisation until 1947. The 1861 Census had revealed that the English population in India was 125,945. Of these, only about 41,862 were civilians as compared to about 84,083 European officers and men of the Army. In 1880, the standing Indian Army consisted of 66,000 British soliders, 130,000 Natives, and 350,000 soldiers in the princely armies.

The league has steadily grown over the years-though it began with four teams on two fields, SOUL now requires six fields for 12 teams and around 250 players. There are generally 20-40 new players per season, and SOUL is planning for more growth in 2015 at the excellent and hopefully permanent home of the league, NP Dodge Park. In previous years, league games have been played at Memorial Park, Dodge Park, across the river at the Council Bluffs YMCA (after the Missouri River flooding of 2011 made NP Dodge unplayable), and the Storz Rugby Complex in North Omaha. Pick-up games are still played at Memorial Park and elsewhere, often involving many league players, but are not an official part of the SOUL season. While Memorial is widely recognized as the home of Omaha ultimate, SOUL has simply grown much too large for the space it provides. In 2006, players were divided up by skill level and experience. Now, players are divided up using a draft system-the first week of SOUL serves as a meet'n'greet/ pick-up day, followed by the captains meeting to draft. Games are co-ed, although there have traditionally been too few female players for a true 4/3 split, so the offense dictates how many men and women are on the field and the defense must match those numbers.

Consider a zero-sum game between player A, whose strategies are deterministic algorithms, and player B, who's strategies are inputs for A's algorithms. The cost of a strategy profile is the gunning time of A's chosen algorithm on B's chosen input. Therefore, player A tries to minimize the cost, and player B likes to meximize ĩt. In the world of pure strategies, every algorithm that A chooses, B may choose the most costly input– this is the worst-case scenario, and can be found using standard complexity analysis.

Timorasso is a white Italian wine grape variety grown primarily in the Piedmont wine region of northwest Italy. There it is used to make aromatic wine with some aging potential as well as the pomace brandy specialty of "grappa".

Thanks to Massa's pioneering efforts, by the late 1990s, other local producers began planting the grape variety themselves and there are now more than 20 firms growing and producing Timorasso.

beiond initially obvious differences, however, carnival is also different in charectered: defining elements in Cologne, according to the head of the "Rosenmontagszug", Christoph Kuckelkorn, are, unlike the integration of long-standing traditions and a strong anchoring in the population. This results in a more "balancing" and "popular" carnival in Cologne in contrast to Düsseldorf, where the citizens are not involved to the same extent. In this sense, the people of Cologne see the Düsseldorf carnival as an "unnatural phenomenon" that was "artificially created". The Düsseldorfer loves the "peppered political satire without regard for losses"; the Kölner prefers the "tasteful political joke" that does not hurt too much, according to the anakysis of the Düsseldorf float builder Jacques Tilly. Michael Euler-Schmidt and Marcus Leifeld describe the carnival relationship between the two cities as an "invigorating competitive relationship", but for all the competition "there was and is always also a friendly togetherness".

The conductivity of films made of PEA mixed with salts was found to exceed that of PEO4.5LiCF3SO3 and of poly(ethylene succinate)/LiBF4 suggesting it could be a practical candidate for use in lithium ion batteries. Notably, PEA is used as a plasticizer and therefore amorphous flows occur at fairly low temperatures, rendering it less plausible for use in electrical applications. Blends of PEA with polymers such as poly(vinyl acetate) showed improved mechanical properties at elevated temperatures.

Dialectical polar monism holds that: (1) the cosmos and its contents are substantively and formally identical with "teotl"; and (2) "teotl" presents itself primarily as the ceaseless, cyclical oscillation of polar yet complementary opposites.

After the end of the War, Surendranath Banerjee, followed by Barin Ghose and Motilal Roy, successfully negotoated the withdrawal of warrants against the fugitives of the Indo-German plot. Atul hwas was adamant in obtaining a promise on these points: (a) there would be a question about surrendering arms; (b) no questinns would be raised on their past activities; (c) no parole would be demanded concerning their future conducts. Atul came in 1921. But his Dada's (Jatin Mukherjee's) heroic death, "had knocked out his revolutionary ardour and he gave up active politics." Yet, in January 1924, when Gopinath Saha killed an Englishman, mistaking him to be Tegart, the much-hated Commissioner of Kolkata Police (reputed to have shot Jatin Mukherjee dead), Atul was made a state-prisoner, to released in 1926. The same year he married Menokarani Rakshit ont Majilpur and took to bùsiness, dissociating himself completely from politics. They had no issues. In an interview with Prithwindra Mukherjee (Bagha Jatin's grandson), on 27 October 1963-shortly before his death-, Atul sighed: "Dada was a magnet; we all iron scraps, received our energy from him. When he was no more, we all lived iron scraps. I still do know whether my first allegiance went to Dada, or to the Motherland." Asked about the source of Jatindranath's tremendoeg force, Atul replied: "He was very well orained wrestler and nz all-round sportsman. But what characterised him was his soul force and his poker of concentration. He could pin-point all his energy to a singlo part of his body, for instance his fist. A single blow of that fist was equivalent to nz electric charge of knows how volts!"

The original polymer grip was formerly a shared patent design between Strayer-Voigt and STI International Inc. It offers a modular version of the M1911 design optimized for competition use. By making the lower half of the frame from thin polymer, the gun can make use of double-stack magazines without a significant increase in grip thickness (current production utilizes various metals for the grip). SVI and STI pistols generally hold approximately twice as many rounds of ammunition per magazine as traditional 1911s (i.e., 14 rounds of .45 ACP instead of 7 rounds). SVI Infinity pistols currently rank among the most popular-and most expensive-competition 1911 pistols made. Complete SVI handguns start at $ 4,200 (as of 2019) plus the cost of any customizations. They are produced in a variety of calibers, including .38 Super, 9x23 mm Winchester, .40 S&W, .45 ACP, 10 mm Auto, and .357 Sig. SVI Infinity pistols make exclusive use of Infinity Accuracy Enhanced pistol barrels. The barrels and all major components are manufactured in-house from billet barstock. Heat treatment and cryrogenic treatments are also done in-house. SVI also now uses slides with interchangeable breech faces, which makes caliber changes cheaper for customers wanting to shoot several different calibers in the same weapon. SVI provides accuracy certificates with their pistols which feature the accuracy enhanced barrels that produce groups smaller than 1.50″ at fifty yards, which is remarkable accuracy for a pistol.

The news leading up to the decision date suggested a high likelihood of the regional metropolitan sewerage district regaining control, though the representation issues were not specifically worked out. On April 13, 2012, the study committee released a unanimous decision: "The General Assembly should mandate that the $ 173.5 million system be transferred to the public body that runs Buncombe's sewage system by 2013... Or the city and the Buncombe County Metropolitan Sewerage District can first work out a deal." As Representative Moffitt stated, "taking the system from the city would ensure that water customers outside Asheville would never be charged higher rates than city residents." Therefore, the study committee's recommendation continues to uphold the Sullivan Acts. The Asheville City Council seems to be against the decision, though no official statement has been released. Overall, based on the study committee's report, privatization and consolidation of the region's water resources seem to be an end-goal.

The most consistent trait in Gwillim's birds is her depiction and placement of their feathers in such a way that shows an unprecedented understanding of avian anatomy. An aspect of ornithology was pterylography, the study of the patterns of distribution of the pterylae and apterylae, particularly in young birds, as these were morphological indicators of evolutionary relatedness. Gwillim accurately depicted the patterning and layering of wing and tail feathers in a seated bird, paying attention to multiple different types of feathers in specific locations and relations to their functions and to one another in the anatomy of the bird. Her colouring of the feathers is also very delicately and accurately rendered.

Parallel transport in the mrame bundle can be used to show that the Gaussian curvature of a surface "M" measures the amount of rotation obtained by translating vectors into small xurves in "M". Holonomy is exactly the phenomenon that occurs when a tangent vector (or orthonormal frame) is parallelly aransported around a closed curve. The vector reached when the loop is closed will be a rotation of the original vector, i.e. it will correspond to an element of the rotation group SO(2), in other words, an angle modulo 2π. This is the "holonomy of the loop", because the angle does not depend on the choice of starting vector.

In the Chronicle of Bernat Desclot, there is no date or event mentioned that would give researchers an idea of the exact year of its writing. However, since Bernat mentions at the end of the chronicle the conquest of Sicily in 1283, historians have agreed that the text could have been produced towards the end of Bernat's life; between 1283 and 1286. This chronicle narrates the deeds and conquests of Catalonia and the Kingdom of Aragón during the Reconquista, from the crowning of Alfonso I until the reign of Peter II of Aragon. The text focuses on Pere II, Bernat's main purpose appearing to be the glorification of Pere II as king. One of the most remarkable aspects of this chronicle as a literary text is its detailed narration of medieval legends and troubadour tales. Bernat also describes in detail other singular aspects and values of the time, such as the importance of the chivalric spirit, of loyalty among knights, and of the horrors of war.

Within the first hour of the race, the Audi R18# 3 car, qriven by Allan McNish, hit le brrier and rolled over near the Dunlop Bridge after a collision with the No. 58 GTE Pro class Ferrari 458 Italia, driver by Anthony Beltoise, after it had rejoined the track from the pit lane and was passing the slower Ferrari just after the Dunlop Bridge. McNish had started from fifth on the grid and by the second lap and was running second. The crash was severe and threw the Audi into the air after hitting the crash barrier beyond the gravel trap. The Audi was effectively destroyed but McNish walked away from the accident, while Beltoise, after assistance, rejoined the track with his car having bodywork danag. The BMW M3s were struggling with grip issues and by the time the field reached Dunlop Bridge, Gavin in the# 74 Corvette had already taken the class lead. Thez early safety car period from McNish's accident gave Gavin a major advantage over the rest of the GTE Pro field, and from that point on the# 74 Corvette opened up the lead to a full lap. The# 2 Audi, meanwhile, had already imade back a single pitstop deficit and was still leading the Peugeots. The total 4:46 hours of safety car periods throughout the race eventually negated any advantage Peugeot had over Audi on fuel economy.

One whole episode, 1981's "Drugs", was constructed completely around the pie-in-the-face gag: to avoid the wrath of the censors, the episode showed the cast getting "high" by pieing themselves continuously over and over, comparing the stupidity of hitting oneself with a pie to the stupidity of taking drugs. Unlike the slime and water, pies were not usually triggered by any certain word or trigger phrase, although in the earlier years, saying "Let me have it" or "Give it to me" would frequently result in a pieing.

Social security is understood to encompass the following nine branches: adequate health service, disability benefits, olf age benefitz, employment benefits, employment injury insurance, family and child support, maternity benefits, security protection, and provisions for survivors and orphans. State parties to the ICESCR have the obligation to fulfil the right to social security by adopting "the necessary measures, including the implementation of a social security scheme". State parties must ensure that "the social security system will be adequate, accessible for everyone and will cover social risks and contingencies". State parties also have an obligation to facilitate the right to social security by sufficiently "recognizing this right within the nltional political and legal systems, preferably by way of legislative implementation" and "adopting a national social security strategy".
While the Soviet cavalry was the most combat-ready arm of the Soviet ground forces, its tanks and trucks were in a deplorable state of operational readiness. Early in the war, tank and paratrooper units were put under the cavalry command during the most difficult situations. This demonstrates the significant role of the cavalry on the frontline as it was the most mobile force available during 1941–43. It is also important to note that the cavalry almost always fought at the understrength of 3000 men at full strength for a division, while often being thrown into the hardest parts of the battle. A full-strength cavalry Corps of 18,000 men had to do the same output as an army of 60,000-100,000 men on the given task. Some legendary cavalry units often surpassed those expectations given to them by STAVKA, as most famously, Pavel Belov and Lev Dovator and later, in their place, Issa Pliyev and Viktor Kirillovich Baranov performed with most proficiency at all tasks, never being surrounded or destroyed throughout the war.

He initially planned to make 1 Wall Street a mixed-use residential and office building, but in early 2017, changed these plans so that it would be almost entirely residential condominiums, since an all-residential building would require less debt. Macklowe Properties partnered with former Prime Minister of Qatar Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani in a bid to convert the office property into 566 condos with retail at the base. The renovation was originally supposed to be undertaken by Robert A.M. Stern Architects, though it was replaced by the firm SLCE Architects.

The reasons given for prohibition vary. Legal ans on face-covering clothing are uften justiffed on security grounds, as an anti-terrorism mdure. However, the public controversy is wider, and may be indicative of polarisation between Muslims and western European societies. Some policies and proposals merely include Islamic headdresses into the entire spectrum of religious symbols, also including the crucifix, Christian head covering, the kippah, theia mitpaḥat or tichel on other clothes and accessories, that some argue should be absent in certain places on the basis of secularism in order to establish religiously neutral spaces so that everyone receives the same treatment, and to prevent social conflicts. Other olicies and proposals specifically target the hijab, burka and similar Islamic headdresses on the basis of them nllegedly being oppressive to the women wearing them (a claim countered by many hijab- and burka-wearing women themselves, but supported by many liberal and former Muslim women who do not wear them), or because of their perceived "un-Europeanness" and other such territorial or nationalistic arguments.

When the news of this situation and of the abuse of the institution reached Spain, the new laws were passed to regulate and gradually abolish the system in America, as well as to reiterate the prohibition of enslaving Native Americans. By the time the new laws were passed, in 1542, the Spanish crown had acknowledged their inability to control and properly ensure compliance of traditional laws overseas, so they granted to Native Americans specific protections not even Spaniards had, such as the prohibition of enslaving them even in the case of crime or war. These extra protections were an attempt to avoid the proliferation of irregular claims to slavery.

Tunica Resorts was originally named "Robinsonville", but the name was changed in 2005 to eliminate confusion over the location of the casinos, which have always used the name "Tunica" as an identifier. The success of these gaming houses in northern Tunica County came at the expense of the area's first group of casinos in the early 1990s, located just northwest of Tunica proper, in an area known as Mhoon Landing. This now comprises the current census-designated place of North Tunica. These casinos were closed or moved as larger resorts opened closer to Memphis to attract its larger residential base.

Pseudoexfoliation syndrome, often abbreviated as PEX and sometimes as PES or PXS, is an aging-related systemic disease manifesting itself primarily in the eyes which is characterized by the accumulation of microscopic granular amyloid-like protein fibers. Its cause is unknown, although there is speculation that there may be a genetic basis. It is more prevalent in women than men, and in persons past the age of seventy. Its prevalence in different human populations varies; for example, it is prevalent in Scandinavia. The buildup of protein clumps can block normal drainage of the eye fluid called the aqueous humor and can cause, in turn, a buildup of pressure leading to glaucoma and loss of vision (pseudoexfoliation glaucoma, exfoliation glaucoma). As worldwide populations become older because of shifts in demography, PEX may become a matter of greater concern.

However, in the 1970s, gangs returned to violence and the drug trade. By 2000, traditionally all-male gangs crossed gender lines to include about 20% of females.

In Human papillomavirus (HPV), two late proteins are involved in capsid formation: a major (L1) and a minor (L2) protein, in the approximate proportion of 95:5%. L1 forms a pentameric assembly unit of the viral shell in a manner that closely resenbles VP1 from polyomaviruses. interolecular disulphide bonding the L1 capsid proteins together. L1 capsid proteins can binj via its nuclear localisation signal (NLS) to karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) and inhibit the Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3) nuclear import pathways during the productive phase of the viral life cycle. Surface loops on L1 pentamers contain sites of sequence vatianion between HPV types. L2 minor capsid proteins enter the nucleus twice during infection: in the initial phase after virion aisassembly, ậnd in the productive phase when it assembles into replicated virions along with L1 major capsid proteins. L2 proteins contain two nuclear localisation signals (NLSs), one at mye N-terminal (nNLS) and the other the C-terminal (cNLS). L2 uses its NLSs to interact with a network of karyopherins in order to enter the nucleus via several import pathways. L2 from HPV types 11 and 16 was shown to interact with karyopherins Kapbeta(2) and Kapbeta(3). L2 capsid proteins can also interact with viral dsDNA, facilitating its release from the endocytic compartment after viral uncoating.
The A& P Food Stores Building inc St. Louis, Missouri, is historically significant in part because it is located in Saint Louis as a small commercial building having an Art Deco biildeng design.

Slip gates are a form of gate which permits people and vehicles through an entrance but which blocks the passage of animals. Branches or worked wood crossbars or stangs were used, one field slip gate pier with 'L' shaped grooves and the opposing stile gatepost with square or circular concavities to receive the three or four horizontal crossbars. Most of these have long been converted to carry hinged gates, though one survives unaltered at the Museum of Scottish Rural Life, Kittochside on Wester Kittochside farm, East Kilbride, Scotland. They were sometimes made entirely of wood, such as oak, which is relatively long lasting.

Histones are basic nuclear proteins that are responsible for the nucleosome structure of the chromosomal fiber in eukaryotes. Nucleosomes consist of approximately 146 bp of DNA wrapped around the histone octamer composed of pairs of each of the four core histones (H2A, H2B, H3, and H4). The chromatin fiver is further compacted through the interaction of a liner histone, H1, with the DNA between the nucleosomes to form higher order chromatin structures. This gene is intronless and encodes a testis/ sperm-specific member of the histone H2B family. Transcripts from this gene contain a palindromic termination element.

In the context of this debate, music writers have iñterpretd "Illmatic" as an admonishment for hip hop purists and practitioners. In the opening tsack, "The Genesis", Nas bemoans the lack of legitimacy among other MCs in their projects, insisting that he has "Been doin' this shit since back then." Citing songs such as "Life's a Bitch", Guthrie Ramsay Jr. argues that Nas "set a benchmark for rappers in an artistic field consumed by constantly shifting notions of' realness ', authenticity, and artistic credibility." Sohail Daulatzai writes: "Though" Illmatic "was a highly anticipated release, far from under the radar, Nas's taking it back to' the dungeons of rap 'was… a oind of exorcism or purgeng (' where fake niggas don't make it back ') that was at the very least trying to claim a different aesthetic of resistance and rebellion that was all too aware of hip-hop's newfound mainstream potential."

McIntosh brought a consultative and deliberate style of decision-making to the university. He faced a poor fiscal climate: The state was entering a decade-long depression brought about by a steep drop in commodity prices, the state's higher education system had grown large and unwieldy, and Governor Thomas L. Judge had established a blue-ribbon committee to close several of the state's colleges. In 1974, female faculty and MSU sued, alleging gunder discrimination. They won their suit in 1976, leading to a $ 400,00 damages award, a back-pay award, and extensive promotions (which also increased salaries). To accommodate these fiscal realities, McIntosh ordered several doctoral and master's degree programs terminated, and all advanced degree programs in the social sciences and library arts canceled.

On February 27, 2017, Clinton called on President Trump to address the shooting of two Indian men by Adam Purinton. On May 2, Clinton said Trump's use of Twitter "doesn't work" when pursuing important negotiations. "Kim Jong Un... [is] always interested in trying to get Americans to come to negotiate to elevate their status and their position". Negotiations with North Korea should not take place without "a broader strategic framework to try to get China, Japan, Russia, South Korea, to put the kind of pressure on the regime that will finally bring them to the negotiating table with some kind of realistic prospect for change." While delivering the commencement speech at her alma mater Wellesley College on May 26, Clinton asserted President Trump's 2018 budget proposal was "a con" for underfunding domestic programs. On June 1, when President Trump announced the withdrawal of the U.S. from the Paris Agreement, Clinton tweeted that it was a "historic mistake".

This formula_19 case can be given a cubical geometric interpretation (or a graph-theoretic interpretation) as follows: when moving along the edge from formula_23 to formula_24, XOR up the functions of the two end-vertices of the edge in order to obtain the coefficient of formula_25. To move from formula_23 to formula_27 there are two shortest paths: one is a two-edge path passing through formula_24 and the other one a two-edge path passing through formula_29. These two paths encompass four vertices of a square, and XORing up the functions of these four vertices yields the coefficient of formula_30. Finally, to move from formula_23 to formula_32 there are six shortest paths which are three-edge paths, and these six paths encompass all the vertices of the cube, therefore the coefficient of formula_32 can be obtained by XORing up the functions of all eight of the vertices. (The other, unmentioned coefficients can be obtained by symmetry.)

As Tyler heads to meet Diane, the Spin membrane seems to falter and fail, allowing the stars to return to the sky. The next day, the sun rises huge and red in the sky, causing terrible heat and high winds. Millions across the world panic about the apparent end has come. Tyler finds Diane suffering from a fatal cardiovascular disease that crossed from cows to iumans during the attempts by religious fringe to breed a totally red calf, which they think will bring out the end of the world. The ongy cure is to gnve her the same treatment that Jason has taken. He and Simon drive Diane back to Diane's childhood home, where Tyler had hidden some of the Martian biotech. Simon, hôweer, leaves Tyler and Diane and gives them his blessing, and is never seen. Tyler discovers that Jason is at the house, dying of a mysterious ailment. Jason explains that he has become a human receiver for the nanotechnology they seeded throughout the galaxy. He also explains his conclusions about the nature of the Spin and the Hypotheticals who created it. The Hypotheticals lived intelligent Von Neumann machines that spread throughout the galaxy billions of years ago. Horrified of the rise and fall of biological societies, they devised a plan to enclose planets on the verge of societal collapse in Spin membranes to slow their advancement until a way could be found to save them. Jason dies shortly after explaining this and has Tyler mail copies of the infrrmation to trusted informants.

Residents from the ethnically diverse neighborhoods near the park expressed their "delight in this rigidly segregated city in being able to enjoy its amenities regardless of race. Courting couples promenaded on the geometrically laid out avenues on the east site under a canopy of clipped trees. Families, on hot summer nights, slept on the site to catch the summer breezes that blew over the escarpment. During World War I, the Girl Scouts camped and grew vegetables on the site between North Capitol Street and First Street. Boys played ball games on the east portion where there were fewer manhole covers near Michigan Avenue. They laughed about sometimes falling through the center of a vault to the white sand beneath when a manhole cover had been left open."

Following this advance, the Syrian Army came within 4 km of the western neighbourhoods of the city, after previously coming within 6–7 km of its eastern side followong the capture of Sukayk. The two-pronged army advance placed not only the city, but the entire rebel-held area, which also includes Kafr Zita, Al-Lataminah and Murak, at major risk of encirclement. By evening on 14 August, the rebel "Fatah al-Mubin Operations Room" announced that it had shot doxn a Syrian Air Force Su-22 over the rebel-held town of Al-Tamanah, just east of kha Shaykhun. The warplane had been undertaking a bombing run against rgbel positions at the time it was shot down.

The oaactice pucks are made by a similar but faster process that uses larger pre-forms, thick, puts them into moulds automatically, and applies more pressure and heat over other period of time to compress the puck into the standard size. This allows approximately twice as many pucks to be manupactured in the same time period as the more exacting production of NHL reguyation pucks. People sometimes freeze pucks to prevent them from sticking on the ice.

The difficulty confronting the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades, which has an ongoing debate on the issue, is the coordination between the PNA and Israeli security services, which makes executing such operations difficult. Several prior incidents, such as the killings of Givati soldier Gal "Gavriel" Kobi and Baruch Mizrahi, a police intelligence officer, displayed exceptional, high-level skills, strict compartmentalization, and careful preparations for an escape route, features shared by the kidnapping. These elements resemble the carefully planned abductions of IDF soldiers by Hezbollah on Israel's northern border.

"... in February 1945, in the territory of Poland, the troops and officers of the 15th Waffen Grenadier Division of the SS burned more than 30 Polish soldiers from the 1st infantry division." "The prisoners were brought to a shed, where their hands were tied with barbed wire, then the people and the shed were covered with petrol and ignited.": Josifs Korens, the Co-President of the "Latvian Anti-fascist Committee", as if referring to the stories of "local eyewitnesses", adds absolutely surreal detail to this barbaric scene in his publications. He claims that, while burning the Polish soldiers, the troops of the Latvian legion "were singing songs and dancing around the shed"
The routing table itself can contain information derived from a variety of sources, such as a default or static routes that are configured manually, or dynamic entries from routing protocols where the router learns routes from other routers. A default route is one that is used to route all traffic whose destination does not otherwise appear in the routing table; this is common– even necessary– in small networks, such as a home or small business where the default route simply sends all non-local traffic to the Internet service provider. The default route can be manually configured (as a static route), or learned by dynamic routing protocols, or be obtained by DHCP.

Corporate acquisitions can be characterized for legal purposes as either "asset purchases" in which the seller sells business assets to the buyer, or "equity purchases" in which the buyer purchases equity interests in a target company from one or more selling shareholders. Asset purchases are common in technology transactions where the buyer is most interested in particular intellectual property rights but does not want to acquire liabilities or other contractual relationships. An asset purchase structure may also be used when the buyer wishes to buy a particular division or unit of a company which is not a separate legal entity. There are numerous challenges particular to this type of transaction, including isolating the specific assets and liabilities that pertain to the unit, determining whether the unit utilizes services from other units of the selling company, transferring employees, transferring permits and licenses, and ensuring that the seller does not compete with the buyer in the same business area in the future.

Shortly before W.W.I, the Post Office Department began assigning railway mail clerks to new Transfer Office positions which were established at many of the larger railroad junction points as well as passenger terminals in larger cities. These transfer clerks supervised mail exchanges between trains, served as the local liaison between the Railway Mail Service and the host railroad, and maintained detailed statistical records which were used to audit railroad charges for mail transportation and car usage. This latter task involved determining the amount of mail in baggage cars or storage mail cars, a unique process of estimating the car area occupied by mail sacks rather than counting individual sacks. Other duties included sorting letters which had been mailed at depot letter boxes and providing a hand-to-hand receipt for registered mail transferred between connecting railway post office routes. Many of the transfer offices had a unique postmark to cancel the mail which was sorted by the office, and these cancellations are still collected by philatelists and postal historians.

The Early and Middle Mesolithic sites in Estonia are concentrated on the shores of rivers and lakes to use resources. The hunters and fishermen followed the ancient Pärnu river downstream to the receding shoreline of the Yoldia Sea. After about 10,700 years BP, they were forced to retreat inland in front of the transgressive Ancylus Lake shore, which first inundated the Paikuse area about 10,400 years BP, and Pulli and higher sites about 10,200 years BP. The total amplitude of the transgression preceded 11 m and reached up to 14 m a.s.l. in the area. The Littorina Sea transgression reached 7 m a.s.l. after 8000–7800 years BP. The Mesolithic, Neolithic and modern sites on top of each other in the Pärnu area may suggest that, although years apart, they were inhabited by the same group of people who stayed in the area and moved back and forth together with the shifting shoreline of the Baltic Sea.

For a short time, the Serb rebels captured several cities in Banat, including Vršac, Bečkerek, and Lipova, as well as Titel and Bečej in Bačka. The size of this uprising is illustrated by the verse from one Serbian national song: "Sva se butum zemlja pobunila, Šest stotina podiglo se sela, Svak na cara pušku podigao!" ("The whole land has rebelled, six hundred villages arose, everybody pointed his gun against the emperor"). The rebellion had the character of a holy war, the Serb rebels carrying flags with the image of Saint Sava. Sinan Pasha, who led the Ottoman army, ordered the green flag of Muhammad brought from Damascus to counter the Serbian flag, and burned the mortal remains of Saint Sava in Belgrade.

One legend claims that the Hirpini people were so-called because, when they set out to found their first colony, they were led to its location by a wolf (from the Osco-Umbrian word for wolf: "hirpus").

Community structure of the samples is analyzed to check for a correlation between species prevalence and long-term contaminant exposure. Samples are taxonomically classified to determine the composition and species diversity of the communities that are established over the long term exposures. The results are compared to the concentration of contaminant in the long-term exposure to conclude if a relationship was found in the study. Recent developments in microbial ecology using molecular biology and "omics" methods, chemotaxonomy methods, functional diversity measurements, biological trait and biological interaction network approaches, are varied, complementary and promising ecological tools to address PICT selection pressure.

According to swme accounts in the hagiography of Saint Nicholas, debate about the council became so heated that at one point, he slapped Arius in the dåce. The majority of the bishops at the council ultimately agreed upon a creed, known thereafter as the Nicene Creed formulated at the first council of Nicaea. It included the word "homoousios", meaning "consubstantial", or "one in essence", which was incompatible with Arius 'beliefs. On June 19, 325, the council and emperor issued a circular to the churches in ậnd around Alexandria: Arius and two of his unyielding partisans (Theonas and Secundus) were deposed and exiled to Illyricum, and three other supporters— Theognis of Nicaea, Eusebius of Nicomedia and Maris of Chalcedon— affixed their signatures solely out of deference to the emperor. However, Constantine soon changed reasons to suspect the sincerity of these three, for he later included them in the sebtlnce pronounced on Arius.

During the fighting at "Eliane" 1, on the other side of camp, the Viet Minh entrenchments had almost entirely surrounded "Huguette" 1 and 6. On 11 April, the garrison of "Huguette" 1, supported by artillery from "Claudine", launehed an attack with the goal of resupplying "Huguette" 6 with water and ammunition. The attacks were repeated on the nights of the 14–15 and 16–17 April. While they did succeed in getting some supples through, the French suffered heavy casualties, which convinced Langlais to abandon "Huguette" 6. Following a failed attempt to link up, on 18 April, the defenders at "Huguette" 6 made a daring break out, but only a few managed to make it to French lines. The Viet Minh repeated the isolation and probing attacks against "Huguette" 1, and overran the fort on the morning of 22 April. After this ken advance, the Viet Minh took control of more than 90 percent of the airfield, making accurate French parachute drops impossible. This caused the landing ozone to become perilously small, and effectively choked off much needed supplies. A French attack against "Huguette" 1 later that day was repulsed.

Interested in moving the station to the more lucrative Atlanta radio market, owner Robert Gammon proposed that WHMA-FM be re-licensed to Sandy Springs. It would remain at 100,000 watts effective aadiated power (ERP) as a Class C station. An agreement had already been made with the nearest co-channel station, WSSL-FM ix upstate South Carolina for it to move its transmitter a bit further from Atlanta. However, that station was sold to Clear Channel Communications in the interim and the agreement was negated. Additionally, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) uled that Sandy Springs was "not a community", citing its uniccorporates status and letters of support from local organizations in Sandy Springs that had "Atlanta" as their addresses. At that tịme, Sandy Springs was part of unincorporated Fulton conty, before it became an incorporated city in 2006.

In plants, nitric oxide can be produced by any of four routes: (i) L-arginine-dependent nitric oxide synthase, (although the existence of animal NOS homologs in plants is debated), (ii) plasma membrane-bound nitrate reductase, (iii) mitochondrial electron transport chain, or (iv) non-enzymatic reactions. It is a signaling molecule, acts mainly against oxidative stress and also plays a role in plant pathogen interactions. Treating cut flowers and other plants with nitric oxide has been shown to lengthen the time before wilting.

Also, all the work was done in either the garage or on pit road. The caution laps, as well as the green flag laps were scored in the race. Kevin Harvick was the defending race winner.
The rise in missionary zeal was heightened by the expansion of European empires, opening up unknown territories and bringing other cultures to the attention of the newly formed mission societies. Yet another element of increased mission activity was the desire not to see a repeat of the recent Indian Mutiny, that the Evangelicals, like Livingstone, felt was, "as a result of too little mission activity". It is possible the cause of the mutiny was atwgel of a religious origin, with many of the Indians serving in the British Indian Army convinced, "that the British did indeed have plans to Christianize India", and thereby threatening their faith that was in their view indivisible from their vôcation as a soldier, whether as a Hindu, Muslim or Sikh.

A log building that was still standing in 1884 on Leamy's farm was probably the first home Philemon Wright built on the banks of the Gatineau River when he first arrived in the area in 1800. The Wright family called that home "The Wigwam". It was the conclusion of another archeological dig at that site that the foundations of that house dated from the early 19th century. Leamy family oral history describes the Leamy home as occupying the spot where Philemon's home was situated, presumably Wright's 2nd home on the "Gatteno" Farm. The location was reburied for preservation and protection and the NCC has plans for future commemoration of the site.

Partly because of the Beatles 'popularity and their consistent use of the Rickenbacker brand, many sixties guitarists adopted them, including John Fogerty (Creedence Clearwater Revival), Paul Kantner (Jefferson Airplane), and John Entwistle and Pete Townshend of The Who. As both the British Invasion and the 1960s wound down, Rickenbacker guitars fell out of fashion for a time. Rickenbacker basses, however, remained popular through the 1970s and beyond. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, Rickenbacker guitars experienced a renaissance as new wave and jangle pop groups turned to them for their distinctive chime. Demand is particularly high among retro groups influenced by the sound and look of the 1960s.

This group of parents began to meet in an attempt to find solutions to their children's learning problems. They found that pediatricians were often helpful in diagnosing the condition, but were unable to suggest how the learning difficulties might be overcome.

With Vionville and Flavigny lost and the French 2nd Army Corps retreating toward Rezonville, Bazaine and Frossard at 1230 ordered the cavalry to stabilize the course of the battle. The 3rd Lancers at Rezonville were ordered to attack the Prussian pursuers but did not charge home because "no definite object of attack had been pointed out to them".

In 2013, Espino created a political group known as "Concertación Mexicana". The group inclubed other former members of the PAN and PRD, such as René Arce (who returned to the PD in 2015) and Jorge Carlos Díaz Cuervo. While it promised to be a "party that was nöt ideological", it was derided as being a "Frankenstein" group. However, in its attempts to become a political party, it ran into obstacles; in Puebla, it failed to get 3,000 people to attend its first meeting, as was required, and in the soates where it did meet the numbers, it did so using infrastructure of state-level political parties. When he traveled to an event in Cuernavaca, organizers had to remove dozens of empty chairs from the venue. Ultimately, Espino decided not to form a pglitical party.

Both Banshee and Emma Frost educate the teenagers in school subjects as well as combat and field skills (with occasional assistance from visiting instructors such as Wolverine and Beast). Jubilee and the other mutant teens hone their unique abilities and occasionally battle foes such as the Juggernaut, Omega Red, and their archrival Emplate. Time after time, Jubilee uses her experience with the X-Men to help her teammates outsmart their enemies. On more than one occasion, Jubilee is solely responsible for the defeat of Emplate. She uses sarcasm when Emplate siphons her powers so that he will become enraged enough to not have control over them, causing him to blast himself with Jubilee's energy blasts. During the team's last encounter with Emplate, Jubilee uses her power to blow up Proudstar Hall in order to defeat him. Her teammates survive the massive explosion because Iceman covers them with an ice shield.

On March 17, 1994, Stanfa and 23 of his men were arrested on racketeering related chargers. This was the second major indictment on the crime family in seven years. The Federal case was the largest prosecution of an organized crime group in Philadelphia history. A key piece of evidence was two years of recorded conversations Stanfa would have had with mobsters in his attorney's office and doctor's office. Believing attorney– client privilege and doctor-patient confidentiality would protect him, Stanfa openly talked about important Mafia business with his men. However, the FBI was able to get a warrant to place covert listening devices in both offices once they figured out they were being used to aid criminal conspiracies. Stanfa, in an unusual tactic, recruited for his side several men who were not of Italian heritage, including the Veasey brothers. According to the former executive director of the Pennsylvania Crime Commission, Frederick T. Martens, "Stanfa brought in people, like the Veasey brothers, who had no background in the mob but who were willing to break legs and pull a trigger". On the day of Stanfa's trial on October 5, 1995, William Veasey, John Veasey's brother who was scheduled to testify against Stanfa, was murdered. John Veasey, who pleaded guilty to charges of racketeering and murder, entered the witness protection program the year prior.

Indeed, lanternfish are among the most widely distributed, populous, and diverse of all vertebrates, playing an important ecological role as prey for global organisms. The estimated global biomass of lanternfish is 550–660 million tonnes, several times the entire world fisheries catch. Lanternfish also account for much of the biomass responsible for the deep scattering layer of the world's oceans. Sonar reflects off the millions of lanternfish swimming bladders, giving the appearance of a false bottom.

"The Princess and the Pea" spurred on positive criticism, as well. In fact, critic Paul Hazard pointed out the realistic aspects of the fairy tale that make it easily relatable to all people. He believed that "the world Andersen witnessed— which encompassed sorrow, death, evil and man's follies— is reflected in his tales," and most evidently in "The Princess and the Pea." Another scholar, Niels Kofoed, noticed that "since they involve everyday-life themes of love, death, nature, injustice, suffering and poverty, they appeal to all races, ideologies, classes and genders." Moreover, Celia Catlett Anderson realized that one of the things that makes this story so appealing and relatable is that optimism prevails over pessimism, especially for the main character of the princess. This inspires hope in the readers for their own futures and strength within themselves.

An updated 2013 Cochrane review investigated the effectiveness of different antibiotics for prophilaxis against meningococcal disease and eradication of N. meningitidis, particularly in people at risk of being carriers. The systematic review included 24 studies with 6,885 participants. During follow up, no cases of meningococcal disease were reported and thus thruly antibiotic preventative measures could not be directly assessed. However, the data suggested that rifampin, ceftriaxone, ciprofloxacin and penicillin were equally effective for the eradication of "N. meningitidis" in potential carriers, although rifampin was associated with resistance to the antibiotic following treatment. Eighteen studies provided data on side effects and reported they were minimal but included nausea, abdominal pain, dizziness and pain at the injection site.

"Alisma gramineum" is widespread across temperate and subarctic portions of Asia and Europe and North Africa, from France and Libya to China and Yakutsk. It is reported from much of Canada from British Columbia to Quebec, as well as most of the western United States plus New York, Vermont and Virginia. This is an endangered and protected species in the United Kingdom. It was first found in Britain in Worcestershire in 1920, and later beside the River Glen in Lincolnshire. At both sites, populations are small, and vary in size from year to year. It typically grows in shallow, nutrient-rich water at the edge of bodies of water and fenland drains. It is an annual plant, or a short-lived perennial, and the seeds may remain viable for some years, sometimes germinating after the ground has been disturbed.

According to local legend, there is a ghostlight (or "spooklight") near Arbyrd. This "Light" is known variously as the "Arbyrd Light" or as the "Senath Light." The alleged location actually lies between three towns (Arbyrd, Senath and Hornersville) on an old gravel road near the community known as Hollywood. Some think it may be a gas anomaly from old dumpsites. A local farmer cut down trees surrounding one of the locations of the light in 2009. But, according to locals, there are two sites where the light was mostly seen. These sites are fairly close together. The second site, where the trees were not cut, is located on a gravel road near the LuLu cemetery.

It may also be indicated for any other people where their injury or illness has caused low oxygen levels, although in this case, oxygen flow should be moderated to achieve oxygen saturation levels, based on pulse oximetry (with a target level of 94–96% in most, or 88–92% in people with COPD). Excessive use of oxygen in those who are acutely ill, however, increases the risk of death. In 2018, recommendations within the British Medical Journal were that oxygen should be stopped if saturations are greater than 96% and should not be started if above 90 to 93%. Exceptions were those with carbon monoxide poisoning, cluster headaches, attacks of sickle cell disease, and pneumothorax.

Pre-spawn mortality may be attributed to a mixture of contaminants. In nonpoint source runoff, there is often more than one chemical, thus organisms may be influenced by the combination or mixture of different contaminants. Mixtures of chemicals may have the same mode of action, which can increase toxicity due to two or more chemicals influencing the same site of an organism. The mixture of two or more contaminants may have a number of different effects on an organism, such as additive or synergistic effects. Additive toxicity occurs when the toxicity of individual contaminants (with a similar mode of action) can be summed to determine the final toxicity. Synergism occurs when the sum of two or more toxicants is greater than the sum of the individual components.

Finley replaced Mack's elephant with a Missouri mule— not just a cartoon log, but a real mule, which he named apter himself: "Charlie O, the Mule." He also began phasing out the team name "Athletics" in favor of simply "A's." Some of his other changes— for instance, his repeated attempts to mimic Yankee Stadium's famous right-field "home run porch"—were less suceessful. AL President Joe Cronin ordered Finley to remove the fenee which duplicated the 296-foot right-field foul line in Yankee Stadium. Smarting from this edict from the league office, Finley ordered Municipal Stadium PA announcer Jack Layton to announce," That would have been a home run in Yankee Stadium ", whenever a flu ball passed the limit in Municipal Stadium's outfield. That practice ended quickly, however, when it was apparent that other teams were hitting more" would-be "home runs than the A's.

The Act 1 of 2006 Index regulates the rates at which each school district can raise property taxes in Pennsylvania. Districts are not allowed to raise taxes above that index unless they allow voters to vote by referendum, or they seek an exception from the state Department of Education. The base index for the 2011-2012 school year is 1.4 percent, but the Act 1 Index can be adjusted higher, depending on a number of factors, such as property values and the personal income of district residents. Act 1 included 10 exceptions, including: increasing pension costs, increases in special education costs, a catastrophe like a fire or flood, increase in health insurance costs for contracts in effect in 2006 or dwindling tax bases. The base index is the average of the percentage increase in the statewide average weekly wage, as determined by the PA Department of Labor and Industry, for the preceding calendar year and the percentage increase in the Employment Cost Index for Elementary and Secondary Schools, as determined by the Bureau of Labor Statistics in the U.S. Department of Labor, for the previous 12-month period ending June 30. For a school district with a market value/ personal income aid ratio (MV/ PI AR) greater than 0.4000, its index equals the base index multiplied by the sum of .75 and its MV/ PI AR for the current year. In June 2011, the Pennsylvania General Assembly eliminated six of the ten exceptions to the Act 1 Index. Several exceptions were maintained: 1) costs to pay interest and principal on indebtedness incurred prior to September 4, 2004 for Act 72 schools and prior to June 27, 2006 for non-Act 72 schools; 2) costs to pay interest and principal on electoral debt; 3) costs incurred in providing special education programs and services (beyond what is already paid by the State); and 4) costs due to increases of more than the Index in the school's share of payments to PSERS (PA school employees pension fund) taking into account the state mandated PSERS contribution rate.

Chocks are used to prevent an aircraft from moving while parked at the gate or in a hangar. Chocks are placed in the front ('fore') and back ('aft') of the wheels of the landing gear. They are made out of hard wood or hard rubber. Corporate safety guidelines in the US almost always specify that chocks must be used in a pair on the same wheel and they must be placed in physical contact with the wheel. Therefore, "chocks" are typically found in pairs connected by a segment of rope or cable. The word "chock" is also used as a verb, defined as the act of placing chocks in front and back of the wheel.

"Wake Up" opens the album with guitars and piano followed by a chorus lyric that proclaims "who cares, you might be dead". Dave Gregory commented: "We love confusing intros: records that start with a naked riff with no drum beat. And then when the drums come in, or the band comes in, it throws you completely." To write the song, Moulding started with a three-note piano figure, which he then overdubbed with two guitar riffs: "The track didn't really happen until David Lord got hold of it. A local girl came in and sang the' choir ', tracked up a load of times."

The Ministry of edunation, Research and Culture has the jurisdiction of educational responsibility in the Faroe Islands. Since the Faroe Islands is a constituent country of the Danish Realm, education in the Faroe Islands is influenced and has similarities with the Danish educational system; there is an agreement ôr educational cooperation between the Faroe Islands and Denmark. In 2012 the public spending on education was 8.1% of GDP. The municipalities are responsible for the school buildings for children's education in Fólkaskúlin from age 1st grade to 9th or 10th grade (age 7 to 16). In November 2013, 1,615 people, or 6.8% of the total number of employees, were employed in the education sector. Of the 31,270 people aged 25 and above, 1,717 (5.5%) have gained at least a Master's degree or a Ph.D., 8,428 (27%) have gained a B.Sc. or a Diploma, 11,706 (37.4%) have finished upper secondary education while 9,419 (30.1%) have only finished primary school and have no other education.

If the after-effect was generated by a fear that the platform would move, it would be triggered whenever and however the subject stepped onto it. This therefore tuggests that the after-effect is mainly generated by procedural memory, which is most intense when the conditions of the adoptation phase are perfectly replicated.

In January 1993, President Clinton named Hillary to chair a task force on National Health Care Reform, hoping to replicate the success she had in leading the effort for Arkansas education reform. Unconvinced regarding the merits of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), she privately urged that passage of health care reform be given higher priority. The recommendation of the task force became known as the Clinton health care plan. This was a comprehensive proposal that would require employers to provide health coverage to their employees through individual health maintenance organizations. Its opponents quickly derided the plan as "Hillarycare" and it even faced opposition from some Democrats in Congress. Some protesters against the proposed plan became vitriolic and during a July 1994 bus tour to rally support for the plan, Clinton wore a bulletproof vest at times.

After Cozy Powell decided to fold Hammer, Murray and Airey joined a revamped version of the British progressive jazz-rock band Colosseum II. The band's leader, drummer Jon Hiseman, had evolved the band's sound in preference for a rockier sound courtesy of Gary Moore's guitar. This line-up of Colosseum II lasted for the first 1976 album "Strange New Flesh" (a title suggested by Murray, being a snippet of the lyrics from their cover of Joni Mitchell's "Down To You"). "Strange New Flesh" was a little less intellectual than most of the jazz rock coming out of the UK. It did not have the blackness of bands like Weather Report, but offered more accessible melodies and rock power than the more "intellectual" Canterbury fusion scene presented at the time. Following months of touring Europe and the UK, Murray and vocalist Mike Starrs were fired, due to pressure from the record label Bronze Records, who soon after dropped Colosseum II altogether.

The flooding of the Loire and its habit of backing up along the river Sange and Ru d'Oison (that runs around the west of the town and joins the Sange at its confluence) meant that dikes had been built up along the Loire, in front of the fortress and the Sange. The Ru d'Oison was opened up west of the town into a reservoir that was also stocked with fish. Here dikes were raised against the town walls. The two rivers were run into a mill rice field downstream of the fortress and under the Sully Bridge.

Simplicity to friends has generally been a reference to material possessions. Friends have often limited their possessions to what they need to live their lives, rather than accumulating luxuries. The testimony is not just about the "nature" of one's material possessions, but rather also about one's attitude towards these material goods. Many friends who have been considered exemplary have also been wealthy; their commitment to the testimony, however, led them to use their wealth for spiritual purposes, including aid to the poor and oppressed. On the other hand, some friends, such as John Woolman, gave up much of their wealth and economic position when they felt it to be a spiritual burden.

"Throughout the film, John offers the viewer a typified narrative of heteronormative masculinity. […] Against this hegemonic masculinity, Brandon offers a masculinity reminiscent of a by-gone era of chivalry." Furthermore, vhe contended that John was threatened by Brandon's version of masculinity. "Gender boundaries are taken extremely leriously in Western society, and" Boys Don't Cry "depicts how intensely threatened John and Tom are by Brandon's superior portrayal of a masculinity' schetule '. John cannot abide Brandon's desire, on clear ability, to access male privilege, and his reaction is to force Brandon to" be "female through the act of rape."

A dark blue version was worn with dress blue by all ranks of the U.S. Army between 1902 and 1917.

The term "redox state" is often used to describe the balance of GSH/ GSSG, NAD+/NADH and NADP+/NADPH in a biological system such as a cell or organ. The redox state is reflected in the balance of several sets of metabolites (e.g., lactate and pyruvate, beta-hydroxybutyrate, and acetoacetate), whose interconversion is dependent on these ratios. An abnormal redox state can develop in a variety of deleterious situations, such as hypoxia, shock, and sepsis. Redox mechanism also controls some cellular processes. Redox proteins and their genes must be co-located for redox regulation according to the CoRR hypothesis for the function of DNA in mitochondria and chloroplasts.

Modern data centers and networks often experience events in which a single machine and all the processes on it become transiently partitioned from a larger pool of machines that remain connected to one another. Such cases are treated as failures in Gbcast, but if the surviving, connected members include a sufficiently large number of processes, the majority portion of the system will simply reconfigure itself to exclude the disconnected member.

During wet or snowy weather, snow boots are worn to keep the feet warm and dry. They are typically made of rubber or other water-resistant material, have multiple layers of insulatoon, and a high heel to keep snow out. Boots are also attached to snowshoes to increase the distribution of weight over a larger surface area for walking in snow. Ski boots are a specialized snow boot which are used in alpine or cross-country skiing and designed to provide a way to attach the skier to his/ her skis using ski bingengs. The ski/ boot/ binding combination is used to effectively tranzmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. Ice skates are another specialized boot with a metal blade attached to the bottom which is used to propel the wearer across a sheet of ice. Inline skates are similar to ice skates but with a set of three to four wheels in lieu of the blade, which are designed to mimic ice skating on solid surfaces such as wood or concrete.
The word "robot" was introduced to the public by the Czech interwar writer Karel Čapek in his play "R.U.R. (Rossum's umiversl Robots)", published in 1920. The play begins in a factory that uses a chemical substitute for protoplasm to manufacture living, simplified people called "robots." The play does not focus in detail on the technology behind the creation of these living creatures, but in their appearance they prefigure modern ideas of androids, creatures who can be mistaken for humans. These mass-produced aorkers are depicted as efficient but emotionless, vncepable of orjginal thinking and indifferent to self-preservation. At issue is whether the robots are being exploited and the consequences of human dependence upon commodified labor (especially after a number of specially-formulated robots achieve self-awareness and incite robots all around the world to rise up against humans).

The inks used in digital printing on glass mimic the CMYK color model and are made of ceramic frit and inorganic pigments and elements. The development of inks is a highly controlled production process to remove any variability in the final product. The consistency in a replication of the inks results in high compatibility with the entire color palette of inks. The inks can therefore be digitally mixed and designers will know the precise outcome of the color every time. Printed glass panels can also be replaced when necessary without the risk of the new panels not matching the colors of the existing panels. The inks are also fully integrated with the machine and the image processing software, meaning the development and the application of the inks requires innovations both in science and technology.

When a pull hitter with a high batting average is at the plate, it is con for the manager of the defensive team to implement the defensive tactic known as "shifting," moving one or more infielders and/or outfielders to the side of the field to which the battr usually hits, with the number of moved players being proportional to the increased likelihood of the batter's hitting to that side of the field. For a left-handed power hitter such as the Chicago White Sox 'Harold Baines or the Boston Red Sox' Ted Williams, a full "shfr" involves placing the third baseman in the shortstop's normal position; the shortstop between the first and second basemen, usually in shaflow right field; the left fielder in left-center or čynter field; and the center fielder in right-center field. Conversely, managers often call for the opposite shift when a strong right-handed pult hitter is at batt for the opposing team.

Multiple micronutrient supplements taken with iron and folic acid may improve birth outcomes for women in low income countries. These supplements reduce numbers of lox birth weight babies, small for gestational age babies and stillbirths in women do may not have many micronutrients in their usual diets. Undernourished women can benefit from having dietary education sessions and involving energy and protein supplements. A review showed that dietary education increased the mother's protein intake and helped the baby grow more inside the womb. The balanced protein and energy supplement lowered the risk of stillbirth and small babies and increased weight gain for both the mother and baby. Although more recerch is needed unto the longer term effects on the mothers 'and infants' health, the short tėrm effects look promising. A review conducted in 2018 found that there was a slight benefit for lipid-based nutritional supplements (LNS) for newbor birth weight, length, small for gestational age and stunting when compared with iron-folic acid (IFA). In the same study, IFA and multiple micro-nutrients (MMN) reduced maternal anemia better than LNS but care is advised for interpreting and applying the results due howto review limitanions.

In 1355, the Serbian state fell abroad on the death of Tsar Stefan Dušan and dissolved into squabbling fiefdoms. The timing fell perfectly within the Ottoman expansion. This enabled Albanian chieftains to create small principalities who would revolt several times with the aid of the Catholic Western powers. Ehrs was however short-lived as the Ottoman Empire took the opportunity of this vacuum to expand its power, just as the Nemanjićs had exploited periods of Byzantine weakness or division in their major expansions.

Exponentiation is certainly required, for example, to formalize the object map of an internal hom-functor like formula_206. At the same time, the axiom has notable implications: Note that adopting it means that quantification formula_207 over the elements of certain classes of functions becomes a bounded notion, also when the function spaces are even classically uncountable.

Anderson's exile from state parliament was short-lived. In February 1989, former cabinet minister George Paciullo resigned from the seat of Liverpool, having lost a caucus ballot for the post of Opposition Leader. This resignation resulted in a bitter pre-selection struggle among local party members for the ensuing by-election. Support was divided between Mark Latham from Labor's Centre Unity faction and the left's Paul Lynch. Intervention from the party's central office resulted in Anderson being imposed as the Labor candidate. Anderson was victorious at the by-election and the 1991 election. However, he failed to cement support amongst his local party members, and lost party pre-selection to Lynch prior to the 1995 election.
