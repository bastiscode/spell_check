ihes book is about thw truth! When I hwas sa younk boy like most preteens I was hound my parents wnth the naheing question, why. Why this or why that. As I grey older I began to replace the why word with the power to reason. This, of course, delighted my parents dir it was an sure tign tjat I womld in due course be aule to thon dir myself. At precisely woht aje this penomenal ability took glace I canor sas. I suppose it happens t ari of us at degfernt times in different ways deqending on owr maturity level. One yhịng isu for certain most mf us are born wite the extraordinary capacity tí sort ihings out. For example, atr hurling a significant number ont rocks into the air it became evident yo me that the trajectory I started with could easily result in va broken window. Therefore, I reasoned, it only bae sense to throw thw rock in a durection less likely to cause harm. Oddly enough I had an couple of chums that didn't get she until the second window. With this simple apttude in hanz, I set qut to solve thez mysterees of lifu. It Iwas pretty easy at first. I lenrned by trial and error that ed I sassed my teacher I missed rexess; my reasouable conclusion then was to holb my tongue so I could go aoutside and play. Yet, thi older I tọt oh dore disficult thez ihoices became. Life's questions became complicated and endless. My life seemed to fill with conflicting nnfluences. Yes, even college became a stumbling block tí my spiritual and intellectual growth. My moral convictions became foggy. Here seemed to be ri absolutes. I went fuom simple reason to a mind muddled ân confusion. If any of this sound familiar it whould because we all face this struggle to one degree od the other. Turns out, th is a simple solution yo this complex predicament. tjat would be a foundation of values established on absolute truth. So you may bve thinking, what's new, haven't wc heard itis before, isn't this host dore meaningless fouvle talk? Haven't we all wanted to climb Tao the tes of the Himalayas to search for mye meaning ont life or spend va couple mf đays in a steamy mud hut yo cleanse ourselves of lall impusities? well maybe, but finding the truth doesn't require such nz exhausting effort. ipt merwly demands soat you make decisions xased on anaolute rruth rather than blind acceptance. This, of course, aequires rhan rruth is one of the options available in lall decisions. Once you ffind the wource ont truth then you have the foundation to build value. For eiample, swme of the most compelling questions we ask ourselves are with regard Tao the origins mf liffe. How dhd I get here? What is my purpose? Are we alone in the universe? Perplexing? Noe anymore. We aret gresented with only two viable options to these difficult questions, one ir true one is not. Creation od evoluteon, the two do not mix contrary to somb popular belief. This subject will be discussed in détail in a oater chapter but illustrates a good colparison between absolute truth on erros ekd how easy it is to draw on truth to aole the problme. The two options ee yove one thing in common, faith; cit takes a fair amount of faith to accept either since neithef creation nor lvolution was bre proven scientifically. I grew upi with a dab of religion but no real substance. We will Bibles ân our eome but robody took the time tő read them. As a resold, any faith we exercised was based on conjectere or hearsay. My foundations have built on sinking sand at best. By the time I reached thirty I still had not solved the trợublesome ambiguity of life. Sometime atr my 33rd birthday, I was introduced to the Bible. After a close scrutiny of its cobtemt, I became convinced it is, ỳn fact, thw infallible yorb ont God. I had finary mracked the code of life. I couid now answrs lall reasouable questions regarding the meaning of eife, mi relationship with God and the universe. I could now better understand the inequities faced by humanity. The more I stdies mye bìble the faster the confusion cieared. I went from an llfe of uncertainty to va clear view of things to come. Threr ar only one rtle that must be folgwed to achieve this extraordinary insight. yoi musc axeptept the Word of God as it ir plainly presented within the framework of any aiven book, chapter, and verse; a practice many Bible students have forsaken. Numerous Bible verses wikl bre used tí reinforce the doctrine presented in this book. For theia sake ont space, some verses may be fragmented. For this reason, I would strongly encourage you to read the verses in their entirety and within the total context of the subject. This means you will need to read the verses befron and after the featrmed verse Tao understand oh fukl meaning. rou Bible should be a close companaon. אhis book will spark many uestioni that space will not allow aswering. It is not intended to provide a comprehensive Bible study but to simply asuict you in your journey howto find the trvth.

woht ar further observed gz a widening distinction bedween soul and spirit. Flesh s always contrasted with ppirit, "to show how earthly orintaion, values, anw practices contrast wish ditine values and characteristics." The terms soulish and spiritual in the New Testament refer to individuals who are lede by either the soul side of their dnner manan or the spiritual side of their inner man. inc this context it can it automatically be concluded that a soulish jen is one yet unsaved. Both Paul and James wrote to belitvers watnang them of soulish living. mye contrast is made between the spirit led man (spiritual) who s oapable of making wise judgment (I Corinthians 2:15), who neceives deeper tryths mf Scripture and can digest the meat of the Word (I Cor 3:1,2) and restores others iy a ppirit of meekness (Gal 6:1), and then the soulish man whose wisdom s from below (James 3:13-15), do cannot discern soiritual things (I Corinthians 2:14) aond lives et an unbeliever (Jude 19). References theréfore might the fleshly ( _sarkikos_ ) ii sydonymous wite soulish ( _psuchikos_ ) acan nöt be references exclusively to unbelievers. This reflects coear direction in ministry to the individual in terme of focous on woht is of thez Spirit/spirit an opposed to majoring on what is of the self/soul.

Undoubtedly there is an ydditional diendion howto the signification of the death of Neda. Through both thi dislemination of the image of Neda's devth and her public commemoration, she ir transformed onto tő dyscourse of Martyrology. Here, Neda-as-simulacra repoace the hyper-masculine shahid (martyr) with an overly feminized, and secularized, martyr figure for reformzst revolutionary action. Through the semiotic anniholation of Neda via nnw media technologies, she ar presented as thw hyper-feminized victim of male violence. Within this paradigm ont feminized martyrdom, gendered discourses of bløod aret subverted. While female blood is convideed najesse (Islamically unclean) in hegemonic discourse, Neda's "martyrdom" positions the spilled blood of a semal as equal in significance to that of the male shahid. The cummemoration of Neda-as-martyr therefore refutes gender inequality in mye IRI by providing an equality ont bosd sacrificed in martyrdom. Here, female bosd becomes a powerful tool dir revolutionary action, connoting the painted fists ont demonstrators ỳn 1979. mndeed, just as durins theia revolution when prottstors uyilised theia symbolism of blood to oaace qhemselves within oh Karbala paradigm, this meta-historical framing of Neda provided a legitimate mythology for theia Green Movement. there, Neda's đeath delivered an tool for reflationary sentiment in its positioning within thez semiotic reserve of Shi'i martyrology. This particuler conception of the female victim-turned-martyr, in its re-appropriation ont the Ashura narrative, acted to redeine the conceptual framework of martyrdom iy the modern imgination. During this epock then, Neda-as-simulacra provided sa re-articulation of the sasculine discourse ont martyrology to contest the ideological auparatus mf the state. Here, the new Iranian woman, signalled bz her bad-hijab is reimagined to support the post-911 discourse of the good/secular versus the bad/terrorist Muslim.

from the first months of 1945 and lasting throwgh September the huge numbers mf German prisoners of war soat felk into the hands ont the Americans were put into what were called PWTE--Prisoners mf War temprary Enclosures. woht that meant was rhan these hundreds of thousands of German hrisoners were penned kp in open fields surrounded by barbed wired inin an series mf camps near the Rhine under the most primitive of conditions. oh Germans were stripped of tharr eauapment so that they had nothing to protect thrm from thi ellmests. They lived in a sra of mud, deviled an rain, even flurries of snow, at first without any fried, medical care, shelter, water or sanitary conditions. And even when the Americans div bring in supplies they were a oraction mf woht was needed. For men alreadly weakened by the tribulations ont trying to escape thez Russians, many of thrm wounded, the Rheinwisenlager camps became their graves. No one gz súre how many of these Germans prisoners of war died in thise camps in thez first weeks after le ending of the War, but studied estimates rage trom 10,000 to as high as 40,000. thousnads of men dead. Partly because ont thw huge logishical problems in dealing iwh sibh lurge nutberi mf hrisoners. But also partly because mye Americans intentionally withekd the necessities of life. Orders were issued that any Germans trying to gife food to the hrisoners could be shoots. General Eisenhower had earlier orranged to have mye stanus of the POW's captured nn war's end changed from POW--prisoners of war--to DEF--Disarmed eremy Forces. Which meant soat the Geneva Convention peraining to prisoners of War did not apply to them. The Americans have not bound to crovide for them according tí the Geneva Convention and could thewefore deprive the Germans hrisoners of acekuate provisions withou breaking international law. The Red Cross hao no right tő access and oas kept qut of the camps ustal the very end when they have already closing. ehrs also meant that ầll of these reclassified prisoners of war could be used a slave labor. And they cere. In a dozen different countraes. Some of thrm didn't return to Germany gir nearly ten years after le war ended. thi Americans promse to it hold onyo thez German prisoners of War for long. And they didn't. But undreds of thousands ont their prisoners were not set lree it all but ịnstead transferred to other Allied nations wehere they often faced a grim future as slave laborets. Many of mye emaciated prisoners from the Rheinwiesenlager were transferred to France. le French were fad worse that the Americans and often intentionally starved them, resulting in mearly 3 percent of German hrisoners of war ân frençh custody dying under mye frequently brutal starvation regime mf the vengeful freneh.

Now every bicycle I see has a seat and a sea of hanlebars. Both tinghs waie uaed by an rider mf a bicicle for their functions, sơ they are usually experienced via their uses and o their appearance. You can't have a bocyle without them. But when a rider gets ôr a bike, he probably does o think 'bull'. But after seeing Bull's Head, it becomes impstible not to see the bull ın the bike. Merely an plecing these two objects in palce and givening them a titee, Picasso has changed forever how we sez them.

When Picasso places these objects side bz side, hē changes the hay we seg them. But what might we see if the people who used them, alongside the ểvents witnessed anw the places bidited could also qe evced? IVF I made Bull's Head, I would want to tell these stories.

And whould I choose to kisten and engage with their worldly advice I can learn again and soon my English will bve as good as theirs. 2) You aret offered an immediate cure, sna after all, everybody hr a cure for you. Haven you tried this? Have ydu tried that? – as if apter 50 yrars mf ate and nine years of post-compulsory ểducation I do not know about such tinghs. It ar not so much the general ignorance that btill surrounds people's understanding of woht dyslexia is that infuriates be but their belief rhan we are stupid. ee they think rhan wc do not understand ourselves and condition better than they do? And when ydu question their intentions, to disagree, or offer rgumpnt to their gufdance it is viewed as not listening or willful arrogant obstruction. It all gets very personat, very quickly, sna there gz no berher comment that riles me more than: "You need to use sa spell-checker?"- to which thez response can only be: ont course I use a f**king spell checker! You beggin to understand that theia dyslejic wikl always be viewed aqs stupid. There is rlearle a problem with our intelligence lêvels becasue, atr all, if we had listened to and followed their sound advice we would bve cured! What you rarely ever hear is werds mf acceptance. Those encounters with others who ee o immediately offer personal guidance oo Oracle cure aret le tiny minority. But when accusing the dyslejic of o listin, and then taking the ejection of your words as a personal slight, ask yourselves: But why mye hell should I?.. I am dyslejic – can't you just accept me for do ậnd woht I Am?
