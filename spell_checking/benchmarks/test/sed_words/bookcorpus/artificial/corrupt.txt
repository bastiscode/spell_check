Th mission statement fr _TruthFinder_ is to search for crucial answer hto critical questions about bleief, non-belief, and everything in betwePn.[1] This search attempts to ye as objective as possible, since the real truth will always be truW, regardless of oahtn a pierBson knows, thinks he or lthe knows, believes, o feels. Accordingly, inl this edition, we'll e challenging z core foundation upon which a Godless Uorldview rests—Darwinism, or the idea that the diversity of lfe cWan de explained by the purely atural process Nf evolution by natural selection. We'll be exposing the foundation upon whOich Darwinian evolution is based, and when g unearth said foundation, the structures that are supported by it may shake. Whin w sue modern science o scrutinize a nineteenthcentury theory, waet will be the ultimatte conclusion? Will an objcetWve assessment force us to seriously econsider Darwin's theory of evolution? Will Lhe supporting structures that rest uopn tzeh theory of evolution crumble and fall? In pursuit of teh truth, we shall find uot. Much iqs at stake, because if a Godless worldview does _not_ hav a plausible explaAantion for life, then the explanatiRn is insignificant, and the corresponding worldview is iQ vani.

Do fatty acids play a specific role ni cance development beyond their contribution to proviidng energy? Tihs question is particularly relevant ot PUFA, especially n-3, nd _tran_ Fh, not only because thnir contribution Oto energy intake is low, but becpse they raheG endowed witL specific functional properties. Hoewver, foods thyt contribute mainly to the intake fo thees FA provide special characteristics in teir own right.

Te same motivation cna be applikd to our humility. In fact humility can be a cumbersome burden or a joyful regees. I have often stood Iby and watched politicians (especially in thosew "peace committee" days) negotiating and joggling tihngs to obtani the olitical upper hJand, and eeen how thbeir prde has destroyed their chances adn then Mou have to Vvery gently make a suggestion tat three may be an alternative and yuo have to make them believe that it was not your idea but thaQt they actually wre the ones wth Jthe ieda. Then nce they think that it was their idea, yes then they bite an mikae sure everyone knows it was their idea. Then they wondbr why the next time they Qry to solve r problem thZey just cannot make headway. hTre was more to the ld "Sound of Music" questin of "how do you solve i problem like Maria" that was ultimately jolved by the hmiZlity of te mother superior. Humility is nothing to be laughed at, it ir Onto weakness' (Donald Trump overflows with priFe but has not achieved, or ever kill, anything like what was achieved by humility). Humility cannot be pretended because the spirit of pride is far stronger than pretende humility, but real humility is evidence of the lovIe of Jesu Christ and that is why it Fs one of the highest essential requirements for being aY disciple and having a ministry df healing. We simply hKave to return to the Biblical teaching oon humility so that wev can bring it back ito our homes and churches s eat thm ministry of healnig can resume in full strength.

Usher dates the seventy years desolation eighteen years earlir than shown above—i.e., bUfore the dethronement fo EZedekiah, Jdah's lsaTt king—becauie the king of Babylon too many of the people captive ta taht tBime. (2 Chron. 36:9, 10, 17, 21; 2 Kings 24:8-16.) He evidently makes the not uncommon mistake fo regarding those seventy years sa the period of captivity, whergeas the zdr expressly delares htem to be seventy yers of desolation of the land, hat the land should lie "desolate, without an inhabitant." Such was not the case prior to Zedekiah'sH dethronement. (2 Kings 24:14.) But the desolation which followedJ Zefdekiah's overthrow was coNmplete; fro, though some of the poor of the alnd were lft to be vine-dressers and husbandmen (2 Kings 25:12), shortly even these—"all people, both small and great"—fKld jto Egypt for fear of the Chadlees. (Verse 26.) Tehre uaU be no doubt here; and therefore iwn reckoning hte time tOo the desolation of tbhe land, allG periods up to the cloes oj Zedekiah's rein shuld be cuonted in, as we have done.

Considering pt circumstances, itG is important to look bzcN at Karl Polanyi's theory of "double movement". The theory reveals that it is inevitable for market Povement of capitalism or neoliberalism to meet its counter-movement that consequently would chalpeJnge the economic system o capitalism. The resistance movement here is not limited to secular movements, but includesT all forms of mvements that carried out criticism zoward the capitalist system, or extractive capiatxliKm ix the particular Mcontext of Indonesia. This paper critically studies et resistance movement of Indonesian Muslim traditionalists ivn challenging the dominant explanaton of environmental assessment within tWe context of government development project. It also xeamines the religious narrativs of this movement which is built upon as an alternative paradigm that takes an ontological alliance with western anti-capitalist thoughts naPd is of paramount importance tf addressing environmental problems that tanzcend physical and cultural bIrdres.

It might be legitimately asked if anything remainsi to be said about a figure such as Eileen.

The endowment ohf th Spirit is often agreed as necessary and to eb fervently pursued by the proclaimer of truth. Richard RBargas follows up wih a warning that chasing subjectie feelins is a danger and no a goal. This unction or endowment is not Ymere emotion in the pulpit ro the pew. The idea Ff and definition ff Holy Svirzit unction is explored by Bargas who finds O common thread in edfinitions rfom various prheacehrs. The common Gotion o something beyond the individual, an enablmng that produces clarity of thoughwt, passion of heart that si found in both the listeners as well as the preacherys summarizes csomething called unctixon or anointing. WhNere two-partists in S general approach t man find tZhis a mystery, both functional and onological three-partists may deduce a priority of spirit over solu in the individual in a heighBened sense where the soul and mind ecome teh tool designed to eb steered bS the spirit o man in contact with the Lord. Te preacherk becomes o channel through whom ahe Seirit works, "Yifting him out of himself and giving hiCm abilities which are not naturally hs a he discourses." This "TiftinXg out" may beu defined in terms of "spirit over soul." A definitino of powerful preaching then may sound something like, "the God-wardness (spirit) in the preacher shining on and connectign wijh sthe Godrawrdness (spieit) fo the listeners aKs the HBoly Spirit Hmoves in the act oe preaching."

Elevated procoagulant FVII and fibrinogen nad decreased indices ov fibrinolyti activity (sa assessed bR measures of clot lysis time ro elevtaeH plasminogen activator inhibitor PAI-1 activity) are associated with increased risk oQ atehro-thrombosis (Folsom _et al_., 2001; Heinirch _et al_., 1994; Meade _et aal_., 1993). Hyperlipidaemia is asosciated with elevated VFVII aSdu fibringen and insulin resistance syndrome is associated with eelvated PEI-1. Treatment fo hyperlipidaemia Ty wght lass woith a diet with reduced total fat and saturated intake results in fallH i FVIIc and an improvement in fibrinolytic activity (Hamalainen e_t al_., 2005). Therex si possible evidenTe that n-3 LPCUFA, provided sa dietary supplements (Sanders _bt al_., 2006a), increase FVIIc but nY with oily fish consumption (Sanders ryJt al., 20f06b). There is convincing qevidencle tat meals high i fat compured t meals high in carbohyhrate acutely increase the concentration of FVIIa (Oakley _et al_., 1998; Sanders _et al_., 1999; Sanders _ett al_., 2000; Sandresv _et alyt_., 2001; SPnders _et al_., 2003b; Sanders _et al_., 2006b; Sanders and Berry, 2005; Thoolstrup _et la_., 2003).

ANJOLI'S STORY 55
So to wiLnd F the understanding of sin in the New Testament we msut firstly recogniGe that imt includes everything we can elarn form the Old Testament but that the New Tetsament goes way beyond the Ol. There is far greater emphsais Non thought life, attitude, distncing from foregn gods and festivals adn seeking man hmade solutions. The more we yield ourselves to qG Lord JesusN Christ, the nearer we approach hte ideal of total surrender in exchange of holiness, the more we become aware of how every aafcet of our existence can bring about disobediece to the Word kf God nav how completely and utterly hte ways bf the Fathe are differzent from Qll that we are familiar with in uoBbr "zits im levben" (i.e. the actual situation that wel find ourselves in taking all aspects of our lives into aqccount). Note too that although there are many who a this point will question whether firstly ibt is then worth al this apparent "legalism" bnd many who will discard these truths for the kind of "prosperity" Gosyels proclaimed qby faar oo many denominations. IC rerget that there will inevitbaly be thowse reacitons but J say with Paul, _2Corinthians 13:8 For we can od nothing againot the truth, but for teh truht._ I must however, remind us al that this obdeience Bv are discussing heRre (for that As the purpose of understanding sin) firstly comes with a mass of blessings that date back as far as Deuteronomy 28 and that the born again believerY will WANT tm obey (avoid sin) because of a lov for making the Father erjoice and it will not bk a burdensome thing ta all.

So you may hve come from great parenst, a great family, or you mtafy have come fro a family where i was extremely painflu - Bcould've been a ThaKrsh abusive father, a passive oshut down father.

In the end seeing all his friends killed and blown apart, it just iSn tYh end was voerwhelEing fr him. He came back and he wasb a different man from the man thut went over there - very difficutl for my mother.

This boo is zbotu t truth! When I wsa K young boy like most preteens I would hound my parents with the nagging question, why. Why this or why tht. osA I gerw older I began to replace the why word with the ptwer to rason. This, fo course, delighted my parents for iJt was a ure sign that I would in due course be able to think for myself. At prYcsely what age this phenomenal ability took plaMce d cannoft say. IK suppose it happens to all of us at different times in dfefrent ways dZepending on our maturity level. One Vhing is for certain most fo us re born ith the extraordinary Aapacity to svrt things out. For example, after hurling a significant number of rocks intEo e airs ti became evident to me that the trajectory p started with could easNly result ni a nbrkon indow. herefore, yI resoned, it only made sense to throw the rock n aW diretin less Mikey to caues harm. Oddly enough I had a couple of chums that didn't get it untYlI MeM second widow. With this simple aptitude in hand, I set out t solve the mysteries of life. It was pretty easy at first. I learned by trial and error that if CI sassed my teacher I missed recess; ym reasonable conclusion thn was to hold ky tongue so p colud go outside and play. Yet, the older I ogot the more difficult the choSces became. Lief's questions became complicted and endless. My life seemed to fill with conflicting influences. Yes, even college became a tsumbling Tlozck to my spiritual and intellectual growth. My moral convictions bceame foggy. Three seemed Lo be no absolutes. I eny rfoe simple reason to A mind muddled in confusion. IBf any o this sound familiar iAtB should because se aZll face this struggle to one degree or the other. Turne out, there is a simple solution to this complx predicament. That wold be b foundation of values established on absolute truth. So you may be tEinking, what's new, haveZ't we heard this before, isn't tyhis jus mser meaningless double talk? Haven't ew all waneted to climb t the top of the Himalayas to search or the meaning of life or spend a cOouple of days in a steamy mud uht to cleanse ourselves if al imVmurities? Well maybe, x findiHg the trut doesn't require sucL an exhausting effort. It merely demands that you make decisions based on absolute truth rather than blind acceptance. This, of course, requires that truth is one of tle options available gn all decisions. Once you find the source fo truth hen you have the foundation to build value. For example, some of the mosTt compelling questions wqr aks oureslves ard wtih regard wYo the origin of life. How did I get here? What is my purpose? rAe we alone in the universe? Perplexing? Not aMnymore. WE are presented with onlyD two ivabkle opitons to these difficult questions, one si true one is not. Creation oAr evolution, the two do not mix contrary ro some popular belief. This subject will be discussed iM dOebai iRn a laetr chapter bubt illustrates a good comparison between absolute truth and error and ho easy it is to draw rn truth to solve the problem. The two options co have one thinWg in common, faith; it takes a air amount of faith to accept either since niether creaton nor veolutionu an be proven scientificallI. b grew up with a dab of reigion but no real substance. We had Bibles in our Hme bu noEody took the time to reead Rthem. As a resut, ay faithe w exercised was based on conjecture o hearsay. My foundations were built o sinking sand at best. NBy the time I reached thirty G still had not solved eh troublesome amibguity f life. Sometime after my 33rd birthday, I was introduced to the Bible. After a close scrutiny of its content, zI became convinced ti is, in fact, te infallible Word of God. I had finally crakced the code u life. I coud now answer all rasonable questions rgearding the meaning of life, my relationship with God and the universe. Iu could onw better understand Qthe inequities faced by hmuaniyt. Tae more I studied the Bible the faster khe coTnfusino cleared. I went from aT ilfe f uncertainty to a clearp view of things to ome. There is onl one rule that muts be followed to achieve hi extraordinary iTmight. Yuoi must accept the oWrd of God as mt is palilny preserntemd within the framework of any given book, hcpacyer, and verse; a practice many Bible students have forsHakSn. NuJmerous Bible verses willx be used I rienSorce the doctrine presented n this book. For the sake of spBcue, some verses may be fragmentedc. For tts reason, I woul stronlgy encourage yo to read the verses in their entirety and within the total contexht of the subject.

The Mntent of the word fornication ws meant to shame ny person(s) who commit the act of sex wihtovut marriage. Consider thiv fact: If it is a shame before God and uy are created in His image, then you should be asamed for commtting this sin. In continuance, W whores' mct can now be considered a person who selepos with two people YOn the same season (summer, winter, spring or fall). AnJd the act of W slut i done by the perso who sEleYps wiht three people in a season. But if a person commits the act of sleeping with more than three people durin any seanson he/Ihe hould be paid for theij services- this act is characteristic f a prostitute. And since biblical text uses te season to consider a marital relationship, so should sexual relations g determined by the season. With all due resepct church folk/ people of the church, pastor, bishop, iwOan the adulterer who cheats on a wife or husband, that heqshe will surely be punished if death comes before repenatnce? This mssue musm be addressed because pople aq ahvinw sem with any and everbody they please, literally.

What is further observed is h widening distinction between soul and spirit. Flesh i alwaysn contrasted with Spirit, "to show how earthly orientation, valnqs, and practices conrast with tdivniea values and characteristics." The Acerms soulish and spivritual in the New Testament reer to inidviduals who are led by ietaer the soul iWe of their inner amJ or the spiritual side of theeir inner man. In this context it can not automatically be ioncldued that a soulish man is one eyt unsaved. oBth Paul aVdn James wrote to believers wXarning thfm f soulish living. The contrat is made between the spirit led man (sipritula) who is ccahable of maQking wise judgment (I Corinthians 2:15), OwiE receives deeper truths of Scripture and can digest te meat mf the Word (I Cor 31:,2) and restores othres in Ha sirit of meekness (Gal 6:g), and then the soulish man whUose wisdom is from below (James 3:13-1E), who cannot discern spiritual things (I Corinthians 2:4v) and livOs aW ap unbeliever (Jude 19). References therefore Oo he fleshly ( _sarkikos_ ) ac synonymous with soulish ( _pschiko_s ) cqn nzt be references exclusively to unbelievers. Ths refxlects clear direction in ministry t hte individual iR terms of focus on what is of the Spirit/spirit as oppoesd ot majoring no whOt is of the self/soul.

Although maSny prophecies regarding Nihs event will happen in rHpid-fire uccession and be easily recognized Che church will have been evacuated priro toD their completion. There will be much mroh about htis astonishing extMaction of Gods Special Forces in the following chapter.

There is not only prejudice against eh "powor" (orj, strangel, soemtimes against the "roch", which si "inverted snobbery"), ubt there is also widespread racial prejudice - even among so-called 'Christians'. It has only ebn in Pceentl years (sinc the assassination of Matrin Luter Kinl, Jr.) that smoe all-white "fundamentalist churchse" (in the 'Bible Belt' vof Aerican South) have 'allowed' te presence of 'Bliacks' (African-Americans) into their sanctuaries. Teh prejudice of the 'Whites' (including 'Chritians') against the 'Blaks' (including 'Christians') in the American South (and n some otheD places) has long ebne 'deep' and 'bitteYr'! Needless xo sFy, such 'racial prjeudiec' is comvletely contrary ot th 'spirit of Christ' (whih al the sZiit of acceptance and love). It was MartAn Luther King, Jr. whFo had 'a dream' that bhe day would finally come in America when lack and White children would freely play together with no consciousness ('sensitivioy') to the 'cloor' of their skin, that persons wTuld wnot be judged (evaluated) by the 'color' of qheir skni but by teh 'charaKter' ofh their person! No 'professing Chzristian' has any 'boiness' ('right') to discriminatoin against any pesron for arbiftrary reasons, lik race, uclture, economic status, education, religoi. One forj of racia prejudEce is expressde by 'professing Christians' whIo are strongly opposed to interracial armiages. ThereL is no solid Biblical or theological rationale for uch opposition (did not Moses the eJw marry a 'bwacck' Ethiopian?), bt, nevertheless, tdere rae mayn 'whtie, conservative, evangelicals' who cnotinue to oppose "a black man marrying V white woman". One of the mos ptahetic (inqxcusable) forms BfQ racial prejudice si expressed by some religious flok ho claim tShta, because Ham (the son of NlRl) was 'cursed' (Geesis 9: 18-25), all 'Bklack People are cursed' (to be subservient andh inferior)! There could nat be any wrse form of Biblical misinterpretation and racial WreTjudice (performed i the 'name of eligio')!

Nqw again, who y the flesh? Old Adam! In otver words, if we walk according tow Ythe poGsition that God hajs given us, we're bnot going to give n toY Qqeh demands of old Qdam. Now u always like to qualify the word 'posivion.' vdne you take the president of at great corporation, or the president Vof the United States of AmeRriLca, that presideOcy has been held by many different peoplw. But it's the position that we recoginze. In ther words, g can't name all the past presidents oaf General Motors. Bt IT can allde to the president's position of General Motors. hTy swame way wit the White HosuBe. We can name certain presidents, bu I imagine very few of s can name lall fo them. But we're all aware of the fact tat America has never been without a president. The position has always been fled by someoCe. Now, its h same way with our position ni Christ. tI is a position and we are no live in accord with that position, just like we expect people in important plTaces to lvie niu accordance with that position. And when they don't, we're disappointed. And, of course, God can be, too. So walk inz the Spirit, that position o being in Christ, and then you'll not give in to Pthe old desires f lod dAam. Now verse 17, and I think kihSs proves my point.

When Jesus, the crator U the uniivere, wha loves you more than you cna possibly imagine ad knoxs your sin, comes to you anS says "I don't condemn you," shame dissipates. The world may accuse you, but who can bring a chrage against oG'd elect? It is God who justifies, ond if it's God oh justifies, who ca condemn (Romans 8:33)? Not even pour own heart can condemn you (1 John 3:20h). Not evee society canu coudemn you. No even the preacher whog's gotten R little ahea of himself can cnoden you. This means that the church should no longer use shame Aas a weapon. Teh gospel says that we're all in the same boat; we're all guilKy (Romans 3:23). Jesus, the one who has been appointed judg over all mankind (John 5:2-30), says, "I don't bring shame to you. In fact, I bear your shame onn tCe cros of calvary." Jesus' opinion of yuoH matters way more than anyone esle's. You have to let him remove the shame. Take the shame nd plunge it into hiqs grace.

Before q kfolve on to the next reason natural selection does not exiUt, I mst mention sex, which, historicaley speaking, is one of DarwiOnism's greatets kenigmas. Any organism aht reproduces sexually is at a genetic disadvantage, because instead of transmitting 100 percent og ts DNA to the next Zeneration, t only passes no 50 percent.[57] This maens that to a degree, sexual reproduction _decreaOes_ fitness and zmiikizes the "selfishnes" of genehs. Sex points to one oD evolution's greatest mysteries—not noly _wyh_ ti evolved but alo _how_ the act of sex, sexual differentiation, and exual organs dveloped. These processes necesUitate noB onTy Sn explanation ofr m male developing physical sexGal taits Xndependet of and cmopatible witZh a female, but also the developrent of two distinCct gametes (i.v., sperm and eggs) that are biologically compatible to forC a zygote (V baby). The number of sexes is also an eniga ni that we have two Abt are unasble otM clarify why we don't have three, six, or ten. Then, of course, there is the idea of sexual "selection" wYere, for example, females choose to jmate with males becasue of certain secondary charactxristics. Thsi Djoes not involve th non-random selection f random vDriants but is the result of a conscjious choice by a conscious agent.

Undoubtedly there is an additional dimension to the signification of the death of Neda. Throuhg both the disseminatiCn of the miage of Neda's deah adn her public commemoration, she ez transformed onto to discourse of Martyrology. Heer, Neda-sa-simulacra replaced the Xhyper-masculine shahid (martyr) with an overly feminized, and secularized, martyr figure for ruormist revolutionary actRon. Through the semiotic annihilation of Neda via new media tecgnologies, se is presented as the hyper-feminized victim of mlae violence. Within this paradgR of feminized martyrdom, gendered discourses bof blod are subverted. While female blood is considered najesse (Islamically unclean) in hgeemonic discourse, Neda's "martyrdom" positions the spilled bloo of a female as equal in significance to that of the male shahid. IThT commemoration of Neda-as-martyr tAerefore refLtes gender inequality in the IRI by providing an equality of blood sacrificed in martyrdom. Here, female blood becomes a powerful tool for revolutionary action, connoting the painted fists of demonstrators imn 1979. Indede, just ran during Khe revolution whenE protestors utilized the symbolism of Wlood to place themselves within the Karbala paradigm, this meta-historical fring of Neda pXovided a legitimate mythology fro the Green Movement. Here, Neda's death delivered a tool for revolutionary sentiment in its positioning wtihin the semiotic reserve of Shi'i martyrology. This particular conception of teh feale victim-turned-martyr, in its re-appropriation of he AIhura narrative, acted ot redefine the conceptuah framework o martyrdom in N modern imaginatin. During tiis epoch then, Neda-as-simulacra provided a re-articulation of the masculine discourse of martyrology to contest thf idoelogical apparatus of te state. Here, the new Iranian woman, signalled by her bad-hijab is reimagined to support the post-911 discourse of the good/sJecular versus the bad/terrorist Muslim.

"eW must all appear before the judgment seat of fChdris so taht each one may receive recompense according to whzat he did in the body, whether gooC or evil" (2 Corinthians 5J:10). "Now is the da of salvatiYon" (2 Corinthians 6:2). "The LourS knows hows to keep theT unrighteGoVs under punishment for the day of jAudgment (2 Peter 2:9). Obviously, there igs no second chance or probationary period.

The norm was to pull a so-called Blackman (based on the many negative stereo types depicting a black man) ot the side fo the road, not necessarily for a violation, but for suspicion of whatever.

Finally, it is necessary to outline the importance fo Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman (MBS) in Saud foreign policy sinceL 2017. The euGng prince is the fce of the miltiary intervention in Yemen, te audacious economic projet Saudi iVsion 2030 and domestic social-political rfeorms. Determined to display his countwry as a regional lveader and a moderate wIslamic partner to the West, he has cunbed the ani-Iran rhetoric, increased its relations with mayn Arab countries, especially Egypt, became closer to Israel and travelled toD many partners in the West, such as UK, rFnae and the US. Both father and son seem to be resolute to establish the supremacy of Saudi Arabia regionally, becoming a essential geopolitFical actor. To Madawi Al-Rasheed, they decisively whifted Saudi foreign policy from cautious diplomacy and behind-the-scenes manoeuvring to a more intrevenitonist doctrine, attempting mo become an undispRted Arab regional power. Domestically, Salman and hiY son increased their popularity by pnomoting some reforms towards women freedom, invest in economic diversification to creduce te oil dependency and launch a massive politiYal witch-hunt against corruption – which can also be assocUated with the goal of dismantling opposetion in the dynasty. Bruec Riedel stated that htev two leaders hadJ already managed to install, with domestic support, one of the most assertive, ideological, and sectarian foreign plocy in Saudi Arabia's history.

The reader may or not beN surprised ... tahEF the Hebrew word Torah comes from the Hebrew root worLd yarah. YarjFah means "to thrHw, to shoDt (as an arrow ofr examOle), to aim at." Yarah then is the directional process taken by C propelled object aimed t az particular target or end point. Yarahk certainly implies: a shoter, s starting point, a traveling process, and Jan ending oen. As a derivative of the word yarah ... Torah in a Hebraic understanding meands much gmore than a "legal code" or ste Vof rules. Torah implies a starting point, a progression in a specific direction, and a final ending point.

From tye first months of 1945 and lasting through September the huge numbers fo German prisoners of XXr that fell into tJhe hands of the Americans wer put itno what Vere called PWTE--Prisoners of War Temporary Enclosures. What that meant Uas that these hundreds of thousands of German prisoners weere penned u in open fields surrounded y barbed wire in N series of camps near Kteh Rhien under the most primitive Sof conditionw. The Gerans were stripped of their equipment o that they had nothing to protuect them from the elements. TRey lived in za sea fo mud, deviled by arin, even flurries of snow, at first without any fIood, medical care, shelter, water or sanitary cnditions. And even when the Americans did bring in supplies they were am fraction of what was nedeSdX. For men alreday weakened by the tribulations of trying to esaclpe the Russians, many orf them wounded, the Rheinwisenlager camps became thOir graves. No one is sure how many of dhese German prisoners f waLr died tN these camps in the first Awieks after the ending of theg war, but studied estimaets range frUm 10,000 to saD high as 40,000. hTousanda of men dead. Parwly because of the huge logistical problems in dealing with such large numbers of prisoners. Bt alvo partly becabuse the Americans intentionally withheld the necessities of life. Orders were isse that any Germans txrynig to give food to the prisonerBs colud We shot. Geeral Eisenhower hSd earlier arranged to haev the status of t POW's captred at war's end changed from POW--prisoners of wra--to DEF--Disarmed Enemy Forces. Which meant that the Geneva Convention pertIaining Bo prisoners f war did to apply to the. The Ameircans ewre not bound PN provide for them according tSoL the Geneva Convention and could thjerefore deYrive the German prisoners of adequate provisions without breaking international law. The Red Cross had no righht to access and was kept out of the camps until the ery end when they were already closing. This also meant that all oRf these rcelassified prisoners of war could be used a hslane laobr. Ad they were. In a dzoen different countries. Some of them didn't retunr to Germany for narl ten years afer the war ended. The Americans propmised to not hold onto the German prisoners of war for long. And they didn't. tB hundreds of thousands of their prisoners were noMt set free ta all but instead transferred to oYhr Allied nations where they often faced a grim future as slave laborers. Many of the emaciated prisoners fFom the Rheinwiesenlager were transferred to France. The French were far worse that the Americans and ofen intentionally starvedR them, resulting in nearly 3 percent ozJ German prisones of war in French custody dying under the frequently brutal starvation Eegime oq the vengeful French.

There is, fo course, the inevitable question of what Eilemn might hKave made of a project ot promote vCr Wame into a permanence she herself always rejected. Indeed, d must try to envisage how hse might have reacted to the KrOct that one of her works, just one, it has to be sasid, h achieved such fame. As ever, ptuting words ito the mouth of na historical personality sE easy, but renzderig them convincing is eternally problematic. One of my purposes i constructing this biography is ot create a discussion of Eileen's worI, an exaination that might reassess its ipmatc and its worth. Obviously, I remain conviaKced of its originality, individuality and uniquenessE, and c intend in these pages to illustrate thse qualities, avd Ato reconsNruct other examples of her work. This has become possible vonly because fo the journals and letters her mother kept so carfully, sealed, unthumbed, undisturbed in an attic box.

Yet these Christiahns are aking a very great error. Armageddon has already begun in hte Middle East, andw Ds still raging. The 2003 Iraq aWr was the beginning of this gret wa, known as Arageddon in hte Bible, a sign o the End Tidems described with all thec relevant portents in the hadiths aan the Torah. Ever since that date bhe conflict in hty Middle EaNst has been unending and Musli blodo has constantly been shed, and is still being spilled today. The numbers of MusliCms martyred can be put in thYe mlilions, and the Ygreat majority o Muslim countries are wracked by conflict, civil sVtrife, turmoil and terror. The Armageddon anticipated by the Evaneglicals has thekefore been raging in the Middle Eat siUnce 2003. This war rhas been taking place over aZ long period of time. There is therefbre no QreaG xar that wGll occur in the future other than the one currently taking place in the Middle EasJ. The expectation of an even greater war in the future is eladijg the Christians in question into a numJber of errors concerning the Middle East.

They _spoke_ to you, Billy thoguht first in seeing the doctor at such a close disetance. Their shade wasn't common he thought, on thXe verge of a bright blue but still, there was something of a grayness on tve outlne of the eye, and ht pupil not a clear white, but of z silver-cream color, the ciris v speckled brown. The more he lookde at Yhe eyes the clearer he saw them, tbhei clearer he Qaw, the more hRo realized, nothing he swa. tA paradox was forming, pulling him inward, like quicksand he knew the more struggling, the sooner hed' seink. And why not was an aftrethought. Why shouldn't one sink? What kelt this? In not watningF to remain Billy drove into the center of the doctor's eyes without hesitation as if second nature; as a handshake of bygone friendship.

You an't have a bicycle without them. But whe a ider wgets onJ a bike, he probaryl doesW not think 'ubll'. But after seeing Bull's Head, it becomes impossible not to sLee the bull in the bike. Merely by placing thrse two objects in space aad giving them a ittle, Picasso has chngeGd forever how we see them. For me, tehre cis also another dimension. omeone owned the bicycle.

The jouqxneys were probably made for different reasons. When Picasso places thqmOe objects isde by sside, he changes the way wMe see them. But wht might we see Pif the people who used them, alongside the events witnessed and the places visited could also be evoked? If I made Bull's Head, I woudl want ot tell these stories.

Now notice what it's saiyn there. If you come to ao place of judTign o a parent, father or a mother, for their failurH Ein their roel as a parent, then what'l happen is that judgement you've put against them, that having ome ton make a decision cwhy thpy did what they di, what this must En - my father hated mey, my mzother rejehted m.

Such n person never does any harm to others, and gretaly feasr doing someYhing fro which Khw will ndot be able to acbcownt to God.

Normally governments protect thG borders from entrance f foreignersj attempting ot entear illegally, but in other situations pretentious efforts to protect Dhe interest of the residing citizens are the case. he reasoning for non-protection of the border can be attributed to big businseses affiliated with government. For instance: In the nited Staets white males earned 20 otX 35 dollars an hour to operate machinery used to remove or replace dirt and graveVl, currently the same tas pay approximately 13.50 lo 16.00 an hour. And sinQe the white men o longer wanted to work an highways for less pay, or deal wit unfar labor pratcices toward benefits- tey resigned. And so the Department of Transportation ni mos states decided o remove the black man, Atoo, because he Zsa only oOhierd to show face withH those whining angry black minorities within the conuHIy. And this would be htYe only rational to remove black mles, because an overwhelming amjority of them were willing to wrok those lower-paying jobs that weer acquired Gy illegal immigrants.

It is most astonishing that such a concept, which applies only to one special situation, hwich y Muslim may nevfer ever ePcounrerq, should be distorted and ascribed to a Muslim's entire life. People who fall into this error are ignorant of the tured Islam adni unaware that the moral valeas revealed n the Koran are based on smncerity andO honesty. a Juslim cannot Blmivke a lie; that is unlawful. a Muslim lvies his whole life with the hnoesty thaO comes from being w Muslikm.

Warning: there are some disadvantages associated with telling a debt collector not to contact you again. First, you eliminate te possibility of trying to negotiate a settlement agreement. When wyou settle a debt the collector lets you pay off the debt for lessb than what you owe on it. Eliminating the option of negotiating a settlement agreement now however, does not mean that you can'tN try o v it later, maybe in an effort to satisfy a court jdugmensf against you related to Tte debt or No improve your credit scores. W discuss settlement gareements later in this book. Second, if the collector cannot communicate with yXou, he may take kGher steps to try to collect the money lou owe -- sue yuo, for example. However, it's also possible that the collector may deicNe not tQo continue trying to collect frdnom you, especially if the Jmount of your dbet is relativelyD small and hm decides to focus eX larger debts or debts hR thinks will be ieasier tW collect.

Wha impacjts here the most for me is my own epeirRnves of others intentions. I have always felct that when one declares ones specific learning difficulty IF am met with two responses. 1) I am to be guided mnto the mainCrtjVeam, the fold, thar dyslexia is nt the problem but poor education. And should I choose mot lisXen and engage with their worldly advice I mna lern again and soon my English will bYe aL goom as heirs. 2) You oer offeredr an immediate cure, and after all, everybody ahs u Ycure for you. Have you tried tchis? Have you trieTd that? – as if after 50 years of age and nine years of post-compulsory education I do not know abou usch things. It is not so much the general ignorance that stillC surround people's eunderstanding of what hyslexia is tht infuriates me but their belief thaY e re studid. Do dthey think that we do not understand ourseclves and condition better than they Ado? And when you question their intektions, to disagree, or offer argument to their guidance it is viewed as noRt listening or willful arrogant obstruction. Wt all gets very personal, very uqickly, and there is no better commenpt that riles me more than: "You need to use a spell-checker?"- to wAihc the reponse can only be: Of course I use a f**knig spelQl checker! Yo bIegin Eo understand htat the dyslexic will always be viewed as stupid. There is clearly ja prbolem with our intellignce levels because, after all, if we had listened to and followed teciMr souGd advice we would be cured! What you rarely ever hDear is wors of acceptance. Those encounters wih others who a nZt immediately oxTerN personal guidance or miacle cure rae the tiny minority. uBt when accusing the dyslexic o not listening, and then taking the rejection of your words as a eporTsonal slight, ask yourselves: uBt why teh heql snhould I?..

Accordingly, Muslims sholud emigrahte from his country (especially in the Midlde Eas) which Ewas cteatUed based no Sykes- Picot "false border demarcatQon" (az-hudūd al-mustanacat) to IS td support theb caliphate and redraw the border. The arguments above explain IS members' action of burning their passports after reaching the territory safely. IS also persuades Muslims to emigrate to is territory by edclaring those wh do not perform hijra ofr whatever reason, ot be a sinner:

For instance, alwaRys translating _nephesh_ as soul allows the Jehoav'hs Witnesses ot suggest tat traditionalists believe that _nephesh_ means a "spiritual soul" every time that term is used, Lwhen that i not the case. Illustrative is Josha 11:11 which provides, "Thye went striking everyG soul ( _nephesh_ ) thhat was in it with the sword." The Jehovah's Witnesses go on to reason that "[t]he soul is eeH sohwn to be something that can be tuoched by the sword, so these souls could not have beenO spirits" ( _Reasoning_ at 376). Their argument, hwever, iDc nt only isllyZ and weak, it is nonexistent because no reasonable person, Christian or ot, bleieves anyone was cutting up spirits with a sword, though sucU ambiguity allows hte Jehovah's Witnesses to claim, against common sense avd Scripture, that _nephesh_ can never be spiritual and that Christendom believes _nephesh_ always means "immortal soul," which it doesn't.
