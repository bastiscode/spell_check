what is importantis not theire fashionbut theireknowle dge, attitude to everything including fashion.
in con clusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have theire problems, th eire affairs, theire private lives j ust as normal people do.
also i think clothes willhave many gadgetson them likea small oxygen mask in case s omeone goesin a place with extended pollution-i think there will be many such places ina hund redyears-and a hatdesigned to protect people fromthe strang rays of the sun atmidday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the sunrays will do damage to the human skin.
and because of these circumstances, i wouldlike to have a pa rt of my maney back.
moreover, men p refer to do sports, because sho pping wastes a l ot of time, which iscontrary to the tasts of women , becaus e if theyhave any free t ime, they will gosho pping.
in the advertisement, it said that danny broo k was starring, but in plaseof him th ere was a differentactor and he was really disappointing.
forexample, if the shop isfull of peop le ,it is not enjoyable, because thet will create too much confusion, too much noise with the risk of wasting time.
i do n't like thinking ofmy house ormy life without all thise facilities.
thet wednesday patphoned me and told me the t sally also love d paul.
to cut a long story short, because of everything ihave said above, the correct thing for me to do is to a sk formymaney back, and for you itis just to give it back to me because ofall the trouble and disapp ointment you have made me suffer.

thery are human beings and thery need to keep a little bit ofprivacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal peo ple, to feel that thery are unknown and anonymous and therydo not have to wear sunglasses, h ats or caps every time thery wantto leave home inorder not tobe recognised.
plus, it is mentionedin your advertisement thet discounts are available. in fact, no discount was given to me, though i am a student and as a student i was entitledto get a discount but i paid £ 20 because the cashier had never heard about a ny discounts for this show.
end of all, in my opini on we could go to the centre ofthe town becausether are many places to havea look at and go shoppin g.
i write this lette rto tell you about the programme thetstarts tomorrow, about thetexcellent book i h ave told yout o read.

the media moves the world and famous people use it to i mprove their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make theirlatest moive famous.
people like doing shopping (especially in polan d, where many newand moder n supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visitunderwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they canbuy something new fortheire cars, motorbikes or compu ters .
and last, the most disappoin ting thing, the advertisement also said that danny brook would be theire, my favourite actor, but theire was someoneelse instead of him.
the london fashion and leisure show is an amazing show becausethery are parades with the late st fashions. we could see some famous top models. alsothery will be avariety of cloth es either s ports wear as elegant designs.
it's not that problem that thear was no more discount available-but ihadchosenit, becausei'm (all owed?).
what ismore, thery wasa wide varietyof music.altho ugh the artists weresupposed tobe from all countries, thery were only six nationalities.
wheather ther e is aphone, afax or e-mail soi can be in touch with my family.

ittook me three months tolearn the language and by this time the whole familyhad fallen in lov ewith me, sothet when theydecided to move to london, theyinvited me and now we all livehereand i feel like part of the family, even though itwas very hard at thebeginning.
thery believe that people in thefuture will wear comfortable clothes because thery willbe outgoing, amu sing, etc.
when i got tothe theatre i askedfor the disco unts shown in your advertisement, but therywere n ot available.
in conclusion, i believe thet we ha ve a right to be informed about their lives, providing thet journalistsrespect s ome important rules.
the poi nt of "upper intermediate clase".
thet are human be ings an d the t need to keep a little bit of privacy andfreedom in their livesto continue like normal people, to feel that thet are unknown and anonymous and thet do not have t o wear sunglasses,hats or c ap s every time thet want to leavehome in order not to be recognised.
then, thear wa s only one hour left to installthe different coloured lights; itwas just enough time.
some were justfriendship groups but others took it seriously,maybe just a bit too seriously.thet gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of fr iends, and st artedpicking on younger people, or members of other g angs, trying to start fights with them.
now, it is already possible to sendour shopping list bycomputer, and thi s e option, in the next few years, will beco me the most commonone.
it would provide you w ith a new type of material to cover you r body andyou couldchoise what you want to wear by pressing buttons.
they also ge ve me a ticke t to watch the concert live.
poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, arecreated t oo. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can dis ab le a person, mostly harming th earbrain and thear bodies, and it can also cause death.
nowadays, there are a lot of p eople who live only on the money thery get from adve rtisements,reports about their last romance... but no t everyone does the same t hing.
theire are s ome of the devices of modern technology that most help me buttheire are some others which are also veryimportant for me.
who got married, who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable ch ang ein his compl exion, th es are questions that m ost journalistsare interested in.
also in the advertisement you wrote thet discounts were availabl e,but they weren't, and also thet pe ople could visit the theatre restaurant after the sh ow to eat some thing or to have a drink.
i was sure the ry wassomeone on the otherside of the wall.
sometimes, there are so maney people and they are not friendly at alloryou are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
thesare some points i want to men tion aboutthe differences between what the advertisement sa id and the realities.
amazingly, doctorstell people to look after thear bodies during christmas time: shoppingcan cause you a large variety of undesi rable pains.
then, thery was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
imeani don't thnk we'll change cars into aeroplanes...
so this is a great opportunity for us to get used to thereal wourld of fashion design, because in this show there will be a fashion show, a demonstrat ion fro m make-up artists , anda contestfor hair stylists.
however, i woulda dd that journalists-being aware of that hard topic-shouldtry to moderate what they write in order to respect other pe ople's privacy; since they would p robably notbehappy to have thear own private life exposed!
that will be great because teachers are partofour lifeand thet have to receive all our attentionand friendship because if it wasn't for themwe would never grow and learn howto live our lives more confidently a nd with lots of good experienc es that we will never forget.
the restaurant was closed b ecause thery wasn't any electricity. you shouldclose the theatre until therestaurant can be used.
i think it is an opportunityto meet different people (even if thery are pushing you), to understand what thery like and what thery don't, because even s ome kinds of food can be in fashion.
after helping to dothet and many other things, myfriends and i watched the concert and before green day (the group) left, they came upto us an thankedus for all thehard workwe did, a nd sho ok ourhands.
could you pl ase tellme what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers ussome expenses money to sp end?
thery are s omeof the devic es ofmodern technology that most h elp me butth ery are someotherswhich are also very important for me.
in conc lusion, i stronglybelieve that the hous of t he futurewill be the hous of a new awaren ess. it will be a very positiv e point for opening up our lives.
but if you realize how important wn at youbuy is for your h ealth you will go shopping with a far greater consciousnes s and more joy than before. '
if you interested in t he clothes as well, but you need to r emember, oneis male, but one is female, thery should have different fashion, atthat moment should be had one is boring or have some bad chat, so in the end you both will feel unhappy or angry witheach other.
the otherthing is that on the ticket it appears thatdiscounts wer e available but when i asked aboutit, ther were n one.
the concert was planned for the following friday,which was the day after myteacher geve me my marks.
the historical museum is simply as ymbol, a proof of what the greeks have alwa ys con sidered as a fundamental principle: theirefreedo m.
it is a very cosy building thet is on thesame avenueas the conference building, approxima tely one mile away.
you will see why i'm describingit as the most unforgettable one when youread throught my letter.
it's not thatproblem that thery was no more discount available-but i had chosen it, because i'm (allowed?).
so i feel scared when ithink ab outthe consequences ifsome of the virusesor mad people misuse ashappens the sda ys with sex or other.
as well will have the responsibility of looking aftermy brother w hen theryaren'tat home.
then, i was planning to buy three£ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that therywere discountsavailable but that was not true, s o i could just buy two ticketsand my soncould not see the show.
it was a pity but it did not annoy me because i thougt that the m usical was good enough to pay £20 for.
theprincipal reason i'mwriting t o you at the moment is that i wa nt my maney back, because i felt so d isappointed wi th the theatre and also with the play.
recently, some students have seen an adver tisement about a fashion and leisure show in london.i t willbe on the 14th andwe all wnat to go.
althoughthe entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students , i stro ngly recom mend it for ther excursion and because of ther interests.
i have happily receivedyo ur replyand i wnat to thank you for thism arvellous prize you have given me.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person,but still i'm h appy, that i could be theire.
i wourld prefer to spend the two weeks in a tent,that's, i n my opinion, a w ay tobe nearer the en vironment and the animals, al though i don't mind staying in log cabins.
designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a pirce of art and not for everyday purposes.
thery were some prob lems that were not displayed in the advertisement.
b ut these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive desig ner and you pay the full plice, at the end of the season it ishalf plice. i find it veryunfair for peopl e who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
furthermore, whenyou look arou nd the supermarket, you can't easily find the goods which y ou wnat to buy.
moreover,men prefe r to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, w hic h is contraryto the tastesof wom en, because if thery have any free time, thery will go shopping.
the most exciting thing was when we removed allthe stuff the day afterthe conc ert, and we went to the highlands to spend thewhole day thery.
some of them were speakingwith her , i wasn'tthis lucky person, but still i'm happy, that icouldbe thery.
they could not believethear eyes.
i've read your ad vertisement and t he realitywas different to what was written thery.
also you can compare the differentcultures of all the countries and sometimes thery are planned visits to historical places.
in conclusi on, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people dese rveto have theif pro blems, theif affairs, theifprivate lives j ust as normal people do.
inconcl usion, i believe that we have a rig ht to be informed aboutthear lives, providing that jo urna lists respect some important rules.
i amrea lly disappointed, andi w nat to h ave my money back.
and, finally, rightbefore the start therya nnounced that danny brook would not be in the sho w that evening.
but people would lik e to change the lifestyle in ther hou se because there aren't convenient appliances i n ther houses yet.
thet have more different functions and forms.
last of all, it says in your advertisement that thery is a theatrerestaurantopen after the show but it turned out to be closed because it wasbeing redecorated and no announcement was made.
and thet is always whatwewant.
theproblem is thet most of the advertisement was misleading.
end of all, i n my opinion we could go to the centre of the town because thery are many places to have alook at andgo shopping.
in theadvertisementit also sa id you could visit you r resta urant afterthe show, and that iswnati did, but when i got there it was shu t for no reason.
from the 10 options that i have to choise fr omi will choise two, climbing, which i have been doing for three years because iknow it by hea rt, and swimmingwhich i have a lso been doing every day as part of my d aily routine in portugal.
the dancinglessons should also be f ilmed, especia lly because of thefascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of th er movements.
