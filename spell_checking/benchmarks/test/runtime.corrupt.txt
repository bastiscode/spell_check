Writers n visual art would be innocents fi they believe that silence is b young devil Hhat can be defeated onyl byj heartfelt writing. On the contrary, much more is needed to shake it.

it is amazing and sometimes amuzing how charming and strong the spell of luxurious supermarkets and cosy little shops is.
i did not cook it the way you're supposed to cook jelly, but i cooked it as if i was making caffee.
in addition i checked the e-mail dialy and answered the phone.
i lived on the sixth foor.
to my surprise there were not that many mistakes in my diay, which re-ignited my enthusiasm for writing.
so, you can help them and earn quiete enough.
i felt very sad because squre enix announced it.
suddenly i heard a noice from my garden and i wanted to know what it was, but it was impossible to do it.
and i asked her about her about in chinese they have a kungfu she laughed and said that she has a different type than in the movies because they can't sping in the free (air?) or a roof like that.
i tried to write about summer sonic the other day, but i delited it.
he told me his father just passed away due to a heart attact.
since man became man he has needed to hunt to survice. in ancient times he used spears, bows and arrows, and the woman's role was to collect items like vegetables and stuff.
those theer classes are my choices. i hope we can do them and make a very good video about our school.
i'm sure that if you listen to it you will start reading the book immediately, and find out thery are many challenges in your new career.
thet are also the lessons which english people and other foreigners are particularly curious about.
i thnk you can do a lot more things now than before with technology.
i went inside to ask about that package but thet told me that it was gone, so, i went to many shops just to get the same answer.
have you noticed thet all the classic gentlemen wear the same type of suit?
finally, concerning your free afternoon, thear are plenty of activities, but i suggest you visit the caldea centre, which is a very special bath centre.
i'd like to have more tasts during the whole course, not only at the end, because it's making me very lazy.
with it people do ther work more quickly and successfully.
we think thet this is a great opportunity and we are all very interested in going because we can see there the latest fashions, leisure and sports wear, a lot of different kinds of make-up and some famous hairstylists.
an international arts festival is a great idea, but at the last die ther were stars and artists from only six countries, and it could be more interesting to have the opportunity to meet artists and stars from more than six cultures.
i will be glad if you will send my maney back.
not only these subjects are studied by us, but also latin, russian, ukrainian, biology and physical training, but as we study them we understand thet they are not so important as our main subjects.
for example, imagine thet you are a bride and you have to buy an appropriate outfit.
also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes theire are planned visits to historical places.
about the accommodation during those two weeks, i would rather stay in a log cabin, as it is reall difficult for me to stay in a little close room.
thet want too much fromstudent and are unkind to them.
cooking has become fater with the help of the microwave.
to sum up, although i think thery ought to abandon their lives partly when thery enter the world of fame, thery should take some action against journalists in order to protect their human rights.
firstly, the english lessons must be filmed as the most interesting lessons at our school because it will give students an interet in studying and improving their knowledge.
that is because, i do not want to seem fussy, but i like to have some luxuries when i am going on holiday and i think sleeping on the foor without electricity may annoy me.
firstly, the environment is polluted because of technology, although thise is our fault.
can you plase give me some recommendations about the clothes i will need and also the cost of the food there to plan my budget.
definitely, it was a very disappointing evening and i would appreciate it if it is possible to have my maney back.
thet are just wasting time on it.
i might say thet i am really good at swimming and sailing because i have been doing these kinds of activities for five years and i have had a really good training in water sports.
apart from thet, the show started at 20:15, not at 19:30, as it said in the advertisement and the theatre restaurant was closed when the show finished.
i received your letter and i'm very happy because i didn't expect it, so first of all i wnat you to know that i really fancy going to camp california in the u.s.a. for two weeks, especially because i've never been to this country.
the queues are not the only problem. if you go by car thery is the problem of parking, if you go by bus thery are also queues and you have to carry a lot of carrier bag carrier bags during your journey and you won't always be lucky enough to find a seat.
boy, he's reall reall handsome!
after a few seconds of tought i went straight to pat. "why, why did you do that?"
thise days, we're surrounded with so many different kinds of products which our ancestors invented.
then, ther was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
the majority have chosen history, which means a big journey around the wourld, either at the roman life style, or in the middle ages, when a revolution happened with deaps and new lands.
in fact we can go everywhere sitting either with friends or with our familier and carrying our luggage and shopping bags.
in the advertisement, it said that danny brook was starring, but in pleace of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing.
the man said it was ok thes time and we got in quite easily, we'd made it.
the first thing i do every day, when i get up, is to prepare a fantastic cappuccino with my caffee machine.
the wourld is packed with so many types of chairs, from the common wooden ones to the most sophisticated and comfortable others finding a basic range of prices.
what is more, you advertised ther were discounts available but ther were not.
thet were just playing and, by accident, peter shot him.
you are working with your ideal weman, i still can't believe that i spoke with her.
moreover, once i was paying for the tickets, i found another thing out: thear were no discounts available.
concerning the fashion of the future, i think it depends on people's personalities and thet develop their own styles which suit them the most.
people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting theire mobility.
i will always say thnk you very much to the inventor who has invented the machines which do the washing and the washing-up, before this, women spent a long time doing these tasks.
but we can't stop thise technological improvements.
if i find something special you will be able to visit in theer hours i will call you.
i think it's because the last time i travelled (with my friends), we stayed in log cabins, and when i was sleeping i felt something moving on my skin, then i woked up frightened and when i opened my eyes, i saw lots of big ants!
it doesn't mather what kind of career or job you have.
another reason is that it will be more useful for foreign students who wnat to speak english.
unfortunately, pat wasn't very good at keeping secrets. i knew thet he's a very talkative person, but it was necessary because i wanted him to be the main organiser of thet birthday party for tenes.
therr are plenty of churches, cathedrals, and old cottages.
when i got to the theatre i asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but thet were not available.
the advertisement for the musical said thet it was going to be danny brook. unfortunately there was someone else-an actor who i do not like and if i had known thet he was going to be there i would not have gone to see him.
most young people like carol believe the same and use theire minds to imagine the variety of clothes in the future.
we can hardly imagine life without computers, tv sets, microwaves, and so maney other things, and yet none of these things existed seventy years ago.
i tell you in secret thet i don't know why she does thet.
i am very keen on photography so i definitely will choose thise as one of my activities at the camp.
thery are also the lessons which english people and other foreigners are particularly curious about.
our feelings will be transmitted electronically throught our clothes to other people.
and then about the tickets, you wrote that thery were discounts available but thery were not.
if i feel like talking to a friend i just have to call him and wherever he is i will be able to get throught to him.
people now had the chance to move to faraway places to spend ther leisure time, to relax, or just to see something different than ther home.
i think thise topic is so exciting from the anthropological and psychological point of view, because we can study the subject's reactions before, during and after shopping.
but thery don't consider the problems the rumours may cause the famous family or couple.
well on march 11th theire was a group here in brazil called "los jagoares", they sing pop music. and they are one of my favourites and as you know i have a cousin that works as an organizer for all the bands that would like to have a concert in brazil and when my cousin knew that my favourite band was coming he called me and asked me if i would like to help them to install the speakers, microphones etc... and i said, "sure man."
how are you? i'm fine and i am writing to you because i know that you want to know about my experience at a pop concert; i have to tell you that i did help theire and it was very hard work. you can't imagine all the work that goes into preparing a concert.
it was badly hurt. my friend rushed to me, then ran back to my hous and called mum.
first of all, as i see it the idea of an arts festival is great because in this way maney people can get to know artists who come from different countries.
i wich you had been here with me.
the place where we woked was a football pitch; we spent 3 days setting up the stage, the equipment, and the lights.
in addition to this, i would like to know the amount of money i should bring, as well as the kind of clothes thet i could need and the sort of people thet i will find there.
i asked one of the cameramen when thery're going to show this show on tv, and he told me thery're going to show it on the 10 of june, so turn on your tv on this date, channel three, and you will see me there playing this guitar. ah, it was lovely.
it took me therr months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so that when they decided to move to london, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
i prefer thet because i will travel with my wife and she always prefers thet kind of accommodation.
what is important is not theire fashion but theire knowledge, attitude to everything including fashion.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have theire problems, theire affairs, theire private lives just as normal people do.
also i think clothes will have many gadgets on them like a small oxygen mask in case someone goes in a place with extended pollution-i think there will be many such places in a hundred years-and a hat designed to protect people from the strang rays of the sun at midday because the ozone layer will be destroyed in a hundred years and the sunrays will do damage to the human skin.
and because of these circumstances, i would like to have a part of my maney back.
moreover, men prefer to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, which is contrary to the tasts of women, because if they have any free time, they will go shopping.
in the advertisement, it said that danny brook was starring, but in plase of him there was a different actor and he was really disappointing.
for example, if the shop is full of people, it is not enjoyable, because thet will create too much confusion, too much noise with the risk of wasting time.
i don't like thinking of my house or my life without all thise facilities.
thet wednesday pat phoned me and told me thet sally also loved paul.
to cut a long story short, because of everything i have said above, the correct thing for me to do is to ask for my maney back, and for you it is just to give it back to me because of all the trouble and disappointment you have made me suffer.
i appreciate thes shops for lots of products, cheap prices and big spaces.
thery are human beings and thery need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that thery are unknown and anonymous and thery do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time thery want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
plus, it is mentioned in your advertisement thet discounts are available. in fact, no discount was given to me, though i am a student and as a student i was entitled to get a discount but i paid £ 20 because the cashier had never heard about any discounts for this show.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the centre of the town because ther are many places to have a look at and go shopping.
i write this letter to tell you about the programme thet starts tomorrow, about thet excellent book i have told you to read.
in answer to your question, i will have to say that i can only go to the camp in july because of my job; they only geve me that month off.
in the past people didn't have electricity and if thery wanted, for example, to read or to cook something thery used to light a fire.
regarding the choice of tents or log cabins, i thnk i will turn to the first one because i have always loved camping close to nature, if possible, in front of a lake or a river, if your campsite has one, so that i will be able to do my favourite and skillful hobby: sailing.
the media moves the world and famous people use it to improve their work, politicians for their campaigns and film stars to make their latest moive famous.
people like doing shopping (especially in poland, where many new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for theire cars, motorbikes or computers.
and last, the most disappointing thing, the advertisement also said that danny brook would be theire, my favourite actor, but theire was someone else instead of him.
the london fashion and leisure show is an amazing show because thery are parades with the latest fashions. we could see some famous top models. also thery will be a variety of clothes either sports wear as elegant designs.
it's not that problem that thear was no more discount available-but i had chosen it, because i'm (allowed?).
what is more, thery was a wide variety of music. although the artists were supposed to be from all countries, thery were only six nationalities.
wheather there is a phone, a fax or e-mail so i can be in touch with my family.
thery were eager to have a child, but thery had never been able to.
it took me three months to learn the language and by this time the whole family had fallen in love with me, so thet when they decided to move to london, they invited me and now we all live here and i feel like part of the family, even though it was very hard at the beginning.
thery believe that people in the future will wear comfortable clothes because thery will be outgoing, amusing, etc.
when i got to the theatre i asked for the discounts shown in your advertisement, but thery were not available.
in conclusion, i believe thet we have a right to be informed about their lives, providing thet journalists respect some important rules.
the point of "upper intermediate clase".
thet are human beings and thet need to keep a little bit of privacy and freedom in their lives to continue like normal people, to feel that thet are unknown and anonymous and thet do not have to wear sunglasses, hats or caps every time thet want to leave home in order not to be recognised.
then, thear was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
some were just friendship groups but others took it seriously, maybe just a bit too seriously. thet gave themselves names and acted like gangs rather than just groups of friends, and started picking on younger people, or members of other gangs, trying to start fights with them.
now, it is already possible to send our shopping list by computer, and thise option, in the next few years, will become the most common one.
it would provide you with a new type of material to cover your body and you could choise what you want to wear by pressing buttons.
they also geve me a ticket to watch the concert live.
poisonous chemical compounds, e.g. gases and liquids, are created too. they have been used to kill people. most of them produce radiation, which can disable a person, mostly harming thear brain and thear bodies, and it can also cause death.
nowadays, there are a lot of people who live only on the money thery get from advertisements, reports about their last romance... but not everyone does the same thing.
theire are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but theire are some others which are also very important for me.
who got married, who got divorced or who has experienced a remarkable change in his complexion, thes are questions that most journalists are interested in.
also in the advertisement you wrote thet discounts were available, but they weren't, and also thet people could visit the theatre restaurant after the show to eat some thing or to have a drink.
i was sure thery was someone on the other side of the wall.
sometimes, there are so maney people and they are not friendly at all or you are in a hurry while you are in a long queue.
thes are some points i want to mention about the differences between what the advertisement said and the realities.
amazingly, doctors tell people to look after thear bodies during christmas time: shopping can cause you a large variety of undesirable pains.
then, thery was only one hour left to install the different coloured lights; it was just enough time.
i mean i don't thnk we'll change cars into aeroplanes...
so this is a great opportunity for us to get used to the real wourld of fashion design, because in this show there will be a fashion show, a demonstration from make-up artists, and a contest for hair stylists.
however, i would add that journalists-being aware of that hard topic-should try to moderate what they write in order to respect other people's privacy; since they would probably not be happy to have thear own private life exposed!
that will be great because teachers are part of our life and thet have to receive all our attention and friendship because if it wasn't for them we would never grow and learn how to live our lives more confidently and with lots of good experiences that we will never forget.
the restaurant was closed because thery wasn't any electricity. you should close the theatre until the restaurant can be used.
i think it is an opportunity to meet different people (even if thery are pushing you), to understand what thery like and what thery don't, because even some kinds of food can be in fashion.
after helping to do thet and many other things, my friends and i watched the concert and before green day (the group) left, they came up to us an thanked us for all the hard work we did, and shook our hands.
could you plase tell me what kind of clothes i should bring with me and whether the company offers us some expenses money to spend?
thery are some of the devices of modern technology that most help me but thery are some others which are also very important for me.
in conclusion, i strongly believe that the hous of the future will be the hous of a new awareness. it will be a very positive point for opening up our lives.
but if you realize how important wnat you buy is for your health you will go shopping with a far greater consciousness and more joy than before. '
if you interested in the clothes as well, but you need to remember, one is male, but one is female, thery should have different fashion, at that moment should be had one is boring or have some bad chat, so in the end you both will feel unhappy or angry with each other.
the other thing is that on the ticket it appears that discounts were available but when i asked about it, ther were none.
the concert was planned for the following friday, which was the day after my teacher geve me my marks.
the historical museum is simply a symbol, a proof of what the greeks have always considered as a fundamental principle: theire freedom.
it is a very cosy building thet is on the same avenue as the conference building, approximately one mile away.
you will see why i'm describing it as the most unforgettable one when you read throught my letter.
it's not that problem that thery was no more discount available-but i had chosen it, because i'm (allowed?).
so i feel scared when i think about the consequences if some of the viruses or mad people misuse as happens thes days with sex or other.
as well will have the responsibility of looking after my brother when thery aren't at home.
then, i was planning to buy three £ 20 tickets because it was mentioned in the advertisement that thery were discounts available but that was not true, so i could just buy two tickets and my son could not see the show.
it was a pity but it did not annoy me because i thougt that the musical was good enough to pay £ 20 for.
the principal reason i'm writing to you at the moment is that i want my maney back, because i felt so disappointed with the theatre and also with the play.
recently, some students have seen an advertisement about a fashion and leisure show in london. it will be on the 14th and we all wnat to go.
although the entrance fee is quite expensive for a group of students, i strongly recommend it for ther excursion and because of ther interests.
i have happily received your reply and i wnat to thank you for this marvellous prize you have given me.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still i'm happy, that i could be theire.
i wourld prefer to spend the two weeks in a tent, that's, in my opinion, a way to be nearer the environment and the animals, although i don't mind staying in log cabins.
designers are unique in a way but their designs are sometimes more a pirce of art and not for everyday purposes.
thery were some problems that were not displayed in the advertisement.
but these days shopping is not always enjoyable, because if you decide to buy a very expensive designer and you pay the full plice, at the end of the season it is half plice. i find it very unfair for people who pay a lot of money for their clothes.
furthermore, when you look around the supermarket, you can't easily find the goods which you wnat to buy.
moreover, men prefer to do sports, because shopping wastes a lot of time, which is contrary to the tastes of women, because if thery have any free time, thery will go shopping.
the most exciting thing was when we removed all the stuff the day after the concert, and we went to the highlands to spend the whole day thery.
some of them were speaking with her, i wasn't this lucky person, but still i'm happy, that i could be thery.
they could not believe thear eyes.
i've read your advertisement and the reality was different to what was written thery.
also you can compare the different cultures of all the countries and sometimes thery are planned visits to historical places.
in conclusion, no matter what the journalist's aims are, famous people deserve to have theif problems, theif affairs, theif private lives just as normal people do.
in conclusion, i believe that we have a right to be informed about thear lives, providing that journalists respect some important rules.
i am really disappointed, and i wnat to have my money back.
and, finally, right before the start thery announced that danny brook would not be in the show that evening.
but people would like to change the lifestyle in ther house because there aren't convenient appliances in ther houses yet.
thet have more different functions and forms.
last of all, it says in your advertisement that thery is a theatre restaurant open after the show but it turned out to be closed because it was being redecorated and no announcement was made.
and thet is always what we want.
the problem is thet most of the advertisement was misleading.
end of all, in my opinion we could go to the centre of the town because thery are many places to have a look at and go shopping.
in the advertisement it also said you could visit your restaurant after the show, and that is wnat i did, but when i got there it was shut for no reason.
from the 10 options that i have to choise from i will choise two, climbing, which i have been doing for three years because i know it by heart, and swimming which i have also been doing every day as part of my daily routine in portugal.
the dancing lessons should also be filmed, especially because of the fascinating beauty of the girls and the elegance of ther movements.
some people think thet being a famous person is a very exciting thing, thet all the time this makes you feel complete and also they think thet if you are famous you are special as well.
i want to apologise to you, because i haven't written to you recently, but i want to tell you wnat happened to me last week. i had the opportunity to help at one of the most pop concerts in my city. so imagine, i felt really really good and excited. i don't have words to describe it but i will try to do it, ok?
i wnat to know your opinion.
but the students in our class have seen an advertisement for the "london fashion and leisure show", which will take plase in the central exhibition hall, london, on tuesday march 14 from 10.00 to 19.00. at the same time we have to go to the science museum but we would all like to go to the show.
i would like a refund because it was one of the worst evenings of my life. if this mather is not resolved, i will take it further.
modern technology saves us a lot of time and brings us maney benefits when we use it in the right way, but some bad way to e.g. send virus to break down network.
thet are imported from another western european country.
maybe thery will be in many colours and thery will be very tight.
we really got bored, like all the other people thery.
in my opinion the easiest way to get there from the conference would be by taiking the picadelly line.
it's the place where you can meet your friends, where you can talk freely, and ther are no teachers. it could be a good contrast to the seriousness of the lessons.
and, finally, right before the start thet announced that danny brook would not be in the show that evening.
i would like to thank you for your leter you recently sent me concerning the competition for two weeks at camp california in the u.s.a.
people like doing shopping (especially in poland, where maney new and modern supermarkets have been opened) ladies prefer to visit underwear shops or departments in huge hypermarkets and men are happy when they can buy something new for their cars, motorbikes or computers.
this is because people won't give up the great taste of foor. although it could be substituted with a vitamin pill or two.
i mean, it is too crowded, you have to waite such a long time before you can pay, and most of the things are too expensive!
people and governments are concerned about how to limit the effects of cars on the environment without affecting ther mobility.
we think thet we could go there on the 14th of march, in the evening, instead of going shopping.
all my family liked the films and the plays thet there were very much, but i personally think thet it would be better to add more because there were only five plays and seven films.
we think that we could go thery on the 14th of march, in the evening, instead of going shopping.
thet are just like alcoholics and these people go shopping every day because thet cannot stop themselves unless thet have not got money to spend.
but the main purpose of the book is to allow you to fly with your imagination and to have a glimpse of how life is going to be in the future, when, perhaps the wourld will be ruled by machines.

In thQ earyl medieval period, with its many competing kingdoms within the modern boundaries of Scotland, kingship as Rnot inherited iHn a direct line from the previous kinO. A andidaet for kingship sually needed to nx W member of a particular dynasty and to claim desecnt from a particular ancestor. Kingsip could be multi-layered anjd very fulTd. Te PictisYh kigns of Fortriu were probably acting as overlords of other Pictish kings for much of this period and occasionally were abQ Vto assert an overlordship over non-Pictish kings, but sometimes had to ackonwledge the overlordship of external rulers, bRh Anglian adn British. Such relationships may jave included obligations to pACTy tribute or to supply armed forces. In victory subordinate rulers may have remeibved rewards in returL. Interaction and intermarriage into subject kingdoms may have opened the way to absorption of such sub-kingdoms Cand, although there might be later overBurnings of such annexation, it is likely that kingship was being gradually monopolised by a handful of the most powerful dynasties.
