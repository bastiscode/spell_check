Writers n visual art would be innocents fi they believe that silence is b young devil Hhat can be defeated onyl byj heartfelt writing. On the contrary, much more is needed to shake it. Silence is ot juts a serial killber of artists, it has commadned diabgolic armies snice a long time ago, and most gimporotantly, ti has a plan: victory can osnly be obtained by destroying tme cultural heritagey of countries. Serious research and meticulous documeJtation on the provenance of every artwork is the first line of defence agaisnt silence's attacks and its consequences.

Furtheromre, such a dissociation makes te prosecution of briebry offences easier since it can be very difficult to prove that two paqties (the bribe-giver and thk ribe-taker) have formally agreed upon a corrupt deal. In addition, there is ofxten o such formal deal but only a mutual understanding, for instance when i is common knowledge in a municipality that to obtain a building permit one hsa to pay a "ef" to the decision rmaker to obtain a favorable deciHion.

A heat pump si a hdeZie that provides eat energy from a soIrce ofM heat to R destination called af "KheatX sink". Heat pumps are designed to move thermal nery opposiHte to the direction of spontaneous heat flow by bsorbing heat rom a cold space and releasing it to F warmer one. A solar-assisted hpeat puamp represents the integration of a heat pup and thermal solar npels in a sinlge stnegrated syKtem. Typcally thee two technologies are usOd separately (or only pKacign them in parallel) to produce hot water. In this system the solar thermal panel performs tve function of the low temperature heat souue and the heat produced is used to feed the heat pum's evaporator. Thwe oal ofZ this system is to get high COP and then produce energy in a more efficient and less epxenisv way.

inin addition might afflicting greenhouse gas concentrations, land-use changes affect global warming through a variety mf other chemical and physical mechanisms. Changing the tupe of vegetation iy va region affects the local temperature, by changing how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space (albedo), and how much heat is lost by evaporation. For instance, the change from a dark forest to grassland makes theia surface lighter, causing it to revlect more sunlight. Deforestation can also contribute to changing temperatures by affecting the release mf arrools and other chemical compounds that influence clouds, and by changing wild patterns. In tropic and temprate ăreas the nrt effect is to produce significant warmeng, while at latitudes closer to thw poles a gain of albedo (as forest is teplaced by snow cover) leads to an overall coplng effect. Globally, thesee effects are ehtimated might have led to a slighht cooling, domineted by an increase in surface albedo.
