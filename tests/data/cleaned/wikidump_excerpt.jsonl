{"sequence": "A recursive definition using just set theory notions is that a (non-empty) binary tree is a tuple (\"L\", \"S\", \"R\"), where \"L\" and \"R\" are binary trees or the empty set and \"S\" is a singleton set containing the root."}
{"sequence": "Some authors allow the binary tree to be the empty set as well."}
{"sequence": "From a graph theory perspective, binary (and K-ary) trees as defined here are actually arborescences."}
{"sequence": "A binary tree may thus be also called a bifurcating arborescence—a term which appears in some very old programming books, before the modern computer science terminology prevailed."}
{"sequence": "It is also possible to interpret a binary tree as an undirected, rather than a directed graph, in which case a binary tree is an ordered, rooted tree."}
{"sequence": "Some authors use rooted binary tree instead of \"binary tree\" to emphasize the fact that the tree is rooted, but as defined above, a binary tree is always rooted."}
{"sequence": "A binary tree is a special case of an ordered K-ary tree, where \"k\" is 2."}
{"sequence": "In mathematics, what is termed \"binary tree\" can vary significantly from author to author."}
{"sequence": "Some use the definition commonly used in computer science, but others define it as every non-leaf having exactly two children and don't necessarily order (as left/right) the children either."}
{"sequence": "In computing, binary trees are used in two very different ways: To actually define a binary tree in general, we must allow for the possibility that only one of the children may be empty."}
{"sequence": "An artifact, which in some textbooks is called an \"extended binary tree\" is needed for that purpose."}
{"sequence": "An extended binary tree is thus recursively defined as: Another way of imagining this construction (and understanding the terminology) is to consider instead of the empty set a different type of node—for instance square nodes if the regular ones are circles."}
{"sequence": "A binary tree is a rooted tree that is also an ordered tree (a.k.a."}
{"sequence": "plane tree) in which every node has at most two children."}
{"sequence": "A rooted tree naturally imparts a notion of levels (distance from the root), thus for every node a notion of children may be defined as the nodes connected to it a level below."}
{"sequence": "Ordering of these children (e.g., by drawing them on a plane) makes it possible to distinguish a left child from a right child."}
{"sequence": "But this still doesn't distinguish between a node with left but not a right child from a one with right but no left child."}
{"sequence": "The necessary distinction can be made by first partitioning the edges, i.e., defining the binary tree as triplet (V, E, E), where (V, E ∪ E) is a rooted tree (equivalently arborescence) and E ∩ E is empty, and also requiring that for all \"j\" ∈ { 1, 2 } every node has at most one E child."}
{"sequence": "A more informal way of making the distinction is to say, quoting the Encyclopedia of Mathematics, that \"every node has a left child, a right child, neither, or both\" and to specify that these \"are all different\" binary trees."}
{"sequence": "Tree terminology is not well-standardized and so varies in the literature."}
{"sequence": "In combinatorics one considers the problem of counting the number of full binary trees of a given size."}
{"sequence": "Here the trees have no values attached to their nodes (this would just multiply the number of possible trees by an easily determined factor), and trees are distinguished only by their structure; however, the left and right child of any node are distinguished (if they are different trees, then interchanging them will produce a tree distinct from the original one)."}
{"sequence": "The size of the tree is taken to be the number \"n\" of internal nodes (those with two children); the other nodes are leaf nodes and there are of them."}
{"sequence": "The number of such binary trees of size \"n\" is equal to the number of ways of fully parenthesizing a string of symbols (representing leaves) separated by \"n\" binary operators (representing internal nodes), to determine the argument subexpressions of each operator."}
{"sequence": "Therefore, the number formula_15 of binary trees of size \"n\" has the following recursive description formula_16, and formula_17 for any positive integer \"n\"."}
{"sequence": "It follows that formula_15 is the Catalan number of index \"n\"."}
{"sequence": "The above parenthesized strings should not be confused with the set of words of length 2\"n\" in the Dyck language, which consist only of parentheses in such a way that they are properly balanced."}
{"sequence": "The number of such strings satisfies the same recursive description (each Dyck word of length 2\"n\" is determined by the Dyck subword enclosed by the initial '(' and its matching ')' together with the Dyck subword remaining after that closing parenthesis, whose lengths 2\"i\" and 2\"j\" satisfy ); this number is therefore also the Catalan number formula_15."}
{"sequence": "So there are also five Dyck words of length 6: These Dyck words do not correspond to binary trees in the same way."}
{"sequence": "Instead, they are related by the following recursively defined bijection: the Dyck word equal to the empty string corresponds to the binary tree of size 0 with only one leaf."}
{"sequence": "Any other Dyck word can be written as (formula_21)formula_22, where formula_21,formula_22 are themselves (possibly empty) Dyck words and where the two written parentheses are matched."}
{"sequence": "The bijection is then defined by letting the words formula_21 and formula_22 correspond to the binary trees that are the left and right children of the root."}
{"sequence": "as operator) describing the corresponding binary tree (which is, in fact, the internal representation of the proper list)."}
{"sequence": "The ability to represent binary trees as strings of symbols and parentheses implies that binary trees can represent the elements of a free magma on a singleton set."}
{"sequence": "Binary trees can be constructed from programming language primitives in several ways."}
{"sequence": "In a language with records and references, binary trees are typically constructed by having a tree node structure which contains some data and references to its left child and its right child."}
{"sequence": "Sometimes it also contains a reference to its unique parent."}
{"sequence": "If a node has fewer than two children, some of the child pointers may be set to a special null value, or to a special sentinel node."}
{"sequence": "This method of storing binary trees wastes a fair bit of memory, as the pointers will be null (or point to the sentinel) more than half the time; a more conservative representation alternative is threaded binary tree."}
{"sequence": "In languages with tagged unions such as ML, a tree node is often a tagged union of two types of nodes, one of which is a 3-tuple of data, left child, and right child, and the other of which is a \"leaf\" node, which contains no data and functions much like the null value in a language with pointers."}
{"sequence": "For example, the following line of code in OCaml (an ML dialect) defines a binary tree that stores a character in each node."}
{"sequence": "type chr_tree = Empty | Node of char * chr_tree * chr_tree Binary trees can also be stored in breadth-first order as an implicit data structure in arrays, and if the tree is a complete binary tree, this method wastes no space."}
{"sequence": "In this compact arrangement, if a node has an index \"i\", its children are found at indices formula_27 (for the left child) and formula_28 (for the right), while its parent (if any) is found at index \"formula_29\" (assuming the root has index zero)."}
{"sequence": "Alternatively, with a 1-indexed array, the implementation is simplified with children found at formula_30 and formula_31, and parent found at formula_32."}
{"sequence": "This method benefits from more compact storage and better locality of reference, particularly during a preorder traversal."}
{"sequence": "However, it is expensive to grow and wastes space proportional to 2 - \"n\" for a tree of depth \"h\" with \"n\" nodes."}
{"sequence": "This method of storage is often used for binary heaps."}
{"sequence": "A succinct data structure is one which occupies close to minimum possible space, as established by information theoretical lower bounds."}
{"sequence": "The number of different binary trees on formula_1 nodes is formula_34, the formula_1th Catalan number (assuming we view trees with identical \"structure\" as identical)."}
{"sequence": "For large formula_1, this is about formula_37; thus we need at least about formula_38 bits to encode it."}
{"sequence": "A succinct binary tree therefore would occupy formula_39 bits."}
{"sequence": "One simple representation which meets this bound is to visit the nodes of the tree in preorder, outputting \"1\" for an internal node and \"0\" for a leaf."}
{"sequence": "If the tree contains data, we can simply simultaneously store it in a consecutive array in preorder."}
{"sequence": "This function accomplishes this: The string \"structure\" has only formula_40 bits in the end, where formula_1 is the number of (internal) nodes; we don't even have to store its length."}
{"sequence": "To show that no information is lost, we can convert the output back to the original tree like this: More sophisticated succinct representations allow not only compact storage of trees but even useful operations on those trees directly while they're still in their succinct form."}
{"sequence": "There is a one-to-one mapping between general ordered trees and binary trees, which in particular is used by Lisp to represent general ordered trees as binary trees."}
{"sequence": "To convert a general ordered tree to a binary tree, we only need to represent the general tree in left-child right-sibling way."}
{"sequence": "The result of this representation will automatically be a binary tree if viewed from a different perspective."}
{"sequence": "Each node \"N\" in the ordered tree corresponds to a node \"N' \" in the binary tree; the \"left\" child of \"N' \" is the node corresponding to the first child of \"N\", and the \"right\" child of \"N' \" is the node corresponding to \"N\" 's next sibling --- that is, the next node in order among the children of the parent of \"N\"."}
{"sequence": "This binary tree representation of a general order tree is sometimes also referred to as a left-child right-sibling binary tree (also known as LCRS tree, doubly chained tree, filial-heir chain)."}
{"sequence": "One way of thinking about this is that each node's children are in a linked list, chained together with their \"right\" fields, and the node only has a pointer to the beginning or head of this list, through its \"left\" field."}
{"sequence": "For example, in the tree on the left, A has the 6 children {B,C,D,E,F,G}."}
{"sequence": "It can be converted into the binary tree on the right."}
{"sequence": "The binary tree can be thought of as the original tree tilted sideways, with the black left edges representing \"first child\" and the blue right edges representing \"next sibling\"."}
{"sequence": "The leaves of the tree on the left would be written in Lisp as: which would be implemented in memory as the binary tree on the right, without any letters on those nodes that have a left child."}
{"sequence": "There are a variety of different operations that can be performed on binary trees."}
{"sequence": "Some are mutator operations, while others simply return useful information about the tree."}
{"sequence": "Nodes can be inserted into binary trees in between two other nodes or added after a leaf node."}
{"sequence": "In binary trees, a node that is inserted is specified as to which child it is."}
{"sequence": "To add a new node after leaf node A, A assigns the new node as one of its children and the new node assigns node A as its parent."}
{"sequence": "Insertion on internal nodes is slightly more complex than on leaf nodes."}
{"sequence": "Say that the internal node is node A and that node B is the child of A. (If the insertion is to insert a right child, then B is the right child of A, and similarly with a left child insertion.)"}
{"sequence": "A assigns its child to the new node and the new node assigns its parent to A. Then the new node assigns its child to B and B assigns its parent as the new node."}
{"sequence": "Deletion is the process whereby a node is removed from the tree."}
{"sequence": "Only certain nodes in a binary tree can be removed unambiguously."}
{"sequence": "Suppose that the node to delete is node A. If A has no children, deletion is accomplished by setting the child of A's parent to null."}
{"sequence": "If A has one child, set the parent of A's child to A's parent and set the child of A's parent to A's child."}
{"sequence": "In a binary tree, a node with two children cannot be deleted unambiguously."}
{"sequence": "However, in certain binary trees (including binary search trees) these nodes \"can\" be deleted, though with a rearrangement of the tree structure."}
{"sequence": "Pre-order, in-order, and post-order traversal visit each node in a tree by recursively visiting each node in the left and right subtrees of the root."}
{"sequence": "In depth-first order, we always attempt to visit the node farthest from the root node that we can, but with the caveat that it must be a child of a node we have already visited."}
{"sequence": "Unlike a depth-first search on graphs, there is no need to remember all the nodes we have visited, because a tree cannot contain cycles."}
{"sequence": "Pre-order is a special case of this."}
{"sequence": "See depth-first search for more information."}
{"sequence": "Contrasting with depth-first order is breadth-first order, which always attempts to visit the node closest to the root that it has not already visited."}
{"sequence": "See breadth-first search for more information."}
{"sequence": "Also called a \"level-order traversal\"."}
{"sequence": "In a complete binary tree, a node's breadth-index (\"i\" − (2 − 1)) can be used as traversal instructions from the root."}
{"sequence": "When the breadth-index is masked at bit \"d\" − 1, the bit values 0 and 1 mean to step either left or right, respectively."}
{"sequence": "The process continues by successively checking the next bit to the right until there are no more."}
{"sequence": "The rightmost bit indicates the final traversal from the desired node's parent to the node itself."}
{"sequence": "There is a time-space trade-off between iterating a complete binary tree this way versus each node having pointer/s to its sibling/s."}
{"sequence": "Borel measure In mathematics, specifically in measure theory, a Borel measure on a topological space is a measure that is defined on all open sets (and thus on all Borel sets)."}
{"sequence": "Some authors require additional restrictions on the measure, as described below."}
{"sequence": "Let formula_1 be a locally compact Hausdorff space, and let formula_2 be the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open sets of formula_1; this is known as the σ-algebra of Borel sets."}
{"sequence": "A Borel measure is any measure formula_4 defined on the σ-algebra of Borel sets."}
{"sequence": "A few authors require in addition that formula_4 is locally finite, meaning that formula_6 for every compact set formula_7."}
{"sequence": "If a Borel measure formula_4 is both inner regular and outer regular, it is called a regular Borel measure."}
{"sequence": "If formula_4 is both inner regular, outer regular, and locally finite, it is called a Radon measure."}
{"sequence": "The real line formula_10 with its usual topology is a locally compact Hausdorff space, hence we can define a Borel measure on it."}
{"sequence": "In this case, formula_11 is the smallest σ-algebra that contains the open intervals of formula_10."}
{"sequence": "While there are many Borel measures \"μ\", the choice of Borel measure that assigns formula_13 for every half-open interval formula_14 is sometimes called \"the\" Borel measure on formula_10."}
{"sequence": "This measure turns out to be the restriction to the Borel σ-algebra of the Lebesgue measure formula_16, which is a complete measure and is defined on the Lebesgue σ-algebra."}
{"sequence": "The Lebesgue σ-algebra is actually the \"completion\" of the Borel σ-algebra, which means that it is the smallest σ-algebra that contains all the Borel sets and has a complete measure on it."}
{"sequence": "Also, the Borel measure and the Lebesgue measure coincide on the Borel sets (i.e., formula_17 for every Borel measurable set, where formula_4 is the Borel measure described above)."}
{"sequence": "If \"X\" and \"Y\" are second-countable, Hausdorff topological spaces, then the set of Borel subsets formula_19 of their product coincides with the product of the sets formula_20 of Borel subsets of \"X\" and \"Y\"."}
{"sequence": "That is, the Borel functor from the category of second-countable Hausdorff spaces to the category of measurable spaces preserves finite products."}
{"sequence": "The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is the ordinary Lebesgue integral with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of bounded variation on the real line."}
{"sequence": "The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure, and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind."}
{"sequence": "One can define the Laplace transform of a finite Borel measure μ on the real line by the Lebesgue integral An important special case is where μ is a probability measure or, even more specifically, the Dirac delta function."}
{"sequence": "In operational calculus, the Laplace transform of a measure is often treated as though the measure came from a distribution function \"f\"."}
{"sequence": "In that case, to avoid potential confusion, one often writes where the lower limit of 0 is shorthand notation for This limit emphasizes that any point mass located at 0 is entirely captured by the Laplace transform."}
{"sequence": "Although with the Lebesgue integral, it is not necessary to take such a limit, it does appear more naturally in connection with the Laplace–Stieltjes transform."}
{"sequence": "Then the following are equivalent: The Cramér–Wold theorem in measure theory states that a Borel probability measure on formula_26 is uniquely determined by the totality of its one-dimensional projections."}
{"sequence": "It is used as a method for proving joint convergence results."}
{"sequence": "The theorem is named after Harald Cramér and Herman Ole Andreas Wold."}
{"sequence": "Blackadder Blackadder is a series of four BBC One pseudohistorical British sitcoms, plus several one-off instalments, which originally aired from 1983 to 1989."}
{"sequence": "All television episodes starred Rowan Atkinson as the antihero Edmund Blackadder and Tony Robinson as Blackadder's dogsbody, Baldrick."}
{"sequence": "Each series was set in a different historical period, with the two protagonists accompanied by different characters, though several reappear in one series or another, e.g., Melchett (Stephen Fry) and Lord Flashheart (Rik Mayall)."}
{"sequence": "The first series, \"The Black Adder\", was written by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson, while subsequent episodes were written by Curtis and Ben Elton."}
{"sequence": "The shows were produced by John Lloyd."}
{"sequence": "In 2000, the fourth series, \"Blackadder Goes Forth\", ranked at 16 in the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, a list created by the British Film Institute."}
{"sequence": "In a 2001 poll by Channel 4, Edmund Blackadder was ranked third on their list of the 100 Greatest TV Characters."}
{"sequence": "In the 2004 TV poll to find Britain's Best Sitcom, \"Blackadder\" was voted the second-best British sitcom of all time, topped by \"Only Fools and Horses\"."}
{"sequence": "It was also ranked as the 9th-best TV show of all time by \"Empire\" magazine."}
{"sequence": "Each series is set in a different period of British history, beginning in 1485 and ending in 1917, and comprises six half-hour episodes."}
{"sequence": "Blackadder follows the misfortunes of Edmund Blackadder (played by Atkinson), who in each series is a member of the same British family dynasty."}
{"sequence": "It is implied in each series that the Blackadder character is a descendant of the previous one (the end theme lyrics of series 2 episode \"Head\" specify that he is the great-grandson of the previous), although it is never specified how or when any of the Blackadders (who are usually bachelors) managed to father children."}
{"sequence": "In series one, Edmund Blackadder is not particularly bright, and is much the intellectual inferior of his servant, Baldrick (played by Tony Robinson)."}
{"sequence": "However, in subsequent series the positions are reversed: Blackadder is clever, shrewd, scheming and manipulative while Baldrick is extremely dim."}
{"sequence": "Each incarnation of Blackadder and Baldrick is also saddled with tolerating the presence of a dimwitted aristocrat."}
{"sequence": "In the first two series this is Lord Percy Percy, played by Tim McInnerny."}
{"sequence": "Hugh Laurie plays the role in the third and fourth series, as Prince George, Prince Regent and Lieutenant George, respectively."}
{"sequence": "The first series, made in 1983, was called \"The Black Adder\" and was set in the fictional reign of \"Richard IV\"."}
{"sequence": "The second series, \"Blackadder II\" (1986), was set during the reign of Elizabeth I. \"Blackadder the Third\" (1987) was set during the late 18th and early 19th centuries in the reign of George III, and \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" (1989) was set in 1917 in the trenches of the Great War."}
{"sequence": "\"The Black Adder\", the first series of \"Blackadder\", was written by Richard Curtis and Rowan Atkinson and produced by John Lloyd."}
{"sequence": "It originally aired on BBC1 from 15 June 1983 to 20 July 1983, and was a joint production with the Australian Seven Network."}
{"sequence": "Set in 1485 at the end of the British Middle Ages, the series is written as an alternative history in which Richard III won the Battle of Bosworth Field only to be mistaken for someone else and murdered, and is succeeded by Richard IV (Brian Blessed), one of the Princes in the Tower."}
{"sequence": "The series follows the exploits of Richard IV's unfavoured second son Edmund, the Duke of Edinburgh (who calls himself \"The Black Adder\") in his various attempts to increase his standing with his father and his eventual quest to overthrow him."}
{"sequence": "Conceived while Atkinson and Curtis were working on \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\", the series dealt comically with a number of aspects of medieval life in Britain: witchcraft, royal succession, European relations, the Crusades, and the conflict between the Church and the Crown."}
{"sequence": "Along with the secret history, many historical events portrayed in the series were anachronistic (for example, Constantinople had already fallen to the Ottoman Empire in 1453, predating the events in the episode by 33 years); this dramatic licence would continue in the subsequent \"Blackadders\"."}
{"sequence": "The filming of the series was highly ambitious, with a large cast and much location shooting."}
{"sequence": "The series also featured Shakespearean dialogue, often adapted for comic effect; the end credits featured the words \"Additional Dialogue by William Shakespeare\"."}
{"sequence": "\"Blackadder II\" is set in England during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I (1558–1603), who is portrayed by Miranda Richardson."}
{"sequence": "The principal character is Edmund, Lord Blackadder, the great-grandson of the original Black Adder."}
{"sequence": "During the series, he regularly deals with the Queen, her obsequious Lord Chamberlain Lord Melchett (Stephen Fry) – his rival – and the Queen's demented former nanny Nursie (Patsy Byrne)."}
{"sequence": "Following the BBC's request for improvements (and a severe budget reduction), several changes were made."}
{"sequence": "The second series was the first to establish the familiar Blackadder character: cunning, shrewd and witty, in sharp contrast to the first series' bumbling Prince Edmund."}
{"sequence": "To reduce the cost of production, it was shot with virtually no outdoor scenes (the first series was shot largely on location) and several frequently used indoor sets, such as the Queen's throne room and Blackadder's front room."}
{"sequence": "A quote from this series ranked number three in a list of the top 25 television \"putdowns\" of the last 40 years by the \"Radio Times\" magazine: \"The eyes are open, the mouth moves, but Mr. Brain has long since departed, hasn't he, Percy?\""}
{"sequence": "\"Blackadder the Third\" is set in the late 18th and early 19th centuries, a period known as the Regency."}
{"sequence": "In the series, Edmund Blackadder Esquire is the butler to the Prince Regent, the Prince of Wales (the prince is played by Hugh Laurie as a complete fop and idiot)."}
{"sequence": "Despite Edmund's respected intelligence and abilities, he has no personal fortune to speak of, apart from his frequently fluctuating wage packet (as well, it seems, from stealing and selling off the Prince's socks) from the Prince: \"If I'm running short of cash, all I have to do is go upstairs and ask Prince Fathead for a rise.\""}
{"sequence": "As well as Rowan Atkinson and Tony Robinson in their usual roles, this series starred Hugh Laurie as the Prince Regent, and Helen Atkinson-Wood as Mrs. Miggins."}
{"sequence": "The series features Dr. Samuel Johnson (Robbie Coltrane); William Pitt the Younger (Simon Osborne); the French Revolution (with Chris Barrie, Tim McInnerny as the Scarlet Pimpernel, and Nigel Planer); hammy theatrical actors (Kenneth Connor and Hugh Paddick); a squirrel-hating cross-dressing highwayman (Miranda Richardson); and a duel with the Duke of Wellington (Stephen Fry)."}
{"sequence": "This series is set in 1917, on the Western Front in the trenches of the First World War."}
{"sequence": "Another \"big push\" is planned, and Captain Blackadder's one goal is to avoid being killed, but his schemes always land him back in the trenches."}
{"sequence": "Blackadder is joined by his batman Private S. Baldrick (Tony Robinson) and idealistic Edwardian twit Lieutenant George (Hugh Laurie)."}
{"sequence": "General Melchett (Stephen Fry) rallies his troops from a French château from the front, where he is aided and abetted by his assistant, Captain Kevin Darling (Tim McInnerny), pencil-pusher supreme and Blackadder's nemesis, whose name is played on for maximum comedic value."}
{"sequence": "The series' tone is somewhat darker than the other \"Blackadder\"s; it details the deprivations of trench warfare as well as the incompetence and life-wasting strategies of the top brass."}
{"sequence": "For example, Baldrick is reduced to making coffee from mud and cooking rats, while General Melchett hatches a plan for the troops to walk very slowly toward the German lines, because \"it'll be the last thing Fritz will expect.\""}
{"sequence": "The final episode, \"Goodbyeee\", is known for being extraordinarily poignant for a comedy – especially the final scene, which sees the main characters (Blackadder, Baldrick, George, and Darling) finally going \"over the top\" and charging off into the fog and smoke of no man's land presumably to die."}
{"sequence": "In a list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes, drawn up by the British Film Institute in 2000 and voted for by industry professionals, \"Blackadder Goes Forth\" was placed 16th."}
{"sequence": "The \"Blackadder\" pilot was shot but never broadcast on terrestrial TV in the UK (although some scenes were shown in the 25th anniversary special \"Blackadder Rides Again\")."}
{"sequence": "One notable difference in the pilot, as in many pilots, is the casting."}
{"sequence": "Baldrick is played not by Tony Robinson, but by Philip Fox."}
{"sequence": "Another significant difference is that the character of Prince Edmund presented in the pilot is much closer to the intelligent, conniving Blackadder of the later series than the snivelling, weak buffoon of the original."}
{"sequence": "Set in the year 1582, the script of the pilot is roughly the same as the episode \"Born to Be King\", albeit with some different jokes, with some lines appearing in other episodes of the series."}
{"sequence": "This special, set in the English Civil War, was shown as part of Comic Relief's Red Nose Day on Friday 5 February 1988."}
{"sequence": "The 15-minute episode is set in November 1648, during the last days of the Civil War."}
{"sequence": "Sir Edmund Blackadder and his servant, Baldrick, are the last two men loyal to the defeated King Charles I of England (played by Stephen Fry, portrayed as a soft-spoken, ineffective, naive character, with the voice and mannerisms of Charles I's namesake, the current Prince of Wales)."}
{"sequence": "However, due to a misunderstanding between Oliver Cromwell (guest-star Warren Clarke) and Baldrick, the king is arrested and sent to the Tower of London."}
{"sequence": "The rest of the episode revolves around Blackadder's attempts to save the king, as well as improve his standing."}
{"sequence": "The second special was broadcast on Friday 23 December 1988."}
{"sequence": "In a twist on Charles Dickens' \"A Christmas Carol\", Ebenezer Blackadder is the \"kindest and loveliest\" man in England."}
{"sequence": "The Spirit of Christmas shows Blackadder the contrary antics of his ancestors and descendants, and reluctantly informs him that if he turns evil his descendants will enjoy power and fortune, while if he remains the same a future Blackadder will live shamefully subjugated to a future incompetent Baldrick."}
{"sequence": "This remarkable encounter causes him to proclaim, \"Bad guys have all the fun\", and adopt the personality with which viewers are more familiar."}
{"sequence": "\"Blackadder: Back & Forth\" was originally shown in the Millennium Dome in 2000, followed by a screening on Sky One in the same year (and later on BBC1)."}
{"sequence": "It is set on the turn of the millennium, and features Lord Blackadder placing a bet with his friends – modern versions of Queenie (Miranda Richardson), Melchett (Stephen Fry), George (Hugh Laurie) and Darling (Tim McInnerny) – that he has built a working time machine."}
{"sequence": "While this is intended as a clever con trick, the machine surprisingly works, sending Blackadder and Baldrick back to the Cretaceous period, where they manage to cause the extinction of the dinosaurs through the use of Baldrick's best-worst-and-only pair of underpants as a weapon against a hungry T. Rex."}
{"sequence": "Finding that Baldrick has forgotten to write dates on the machine's dials, the rest of the film follows their attempts to find their way back to 1999, often creating huge historical anomalies in the process that must be corrected before the end."}
{"sequence": "The film includes cameo appearances from Kate Moss and Colin Firth."}
{"sequence": "Broadcast as part of Children in Need and Comic Relief's joint special The Big Night In during the 2020 Covid-19 pandemic, Fry resumed the role of Lord Melchett, Head of the Royal Household, under lockdown at Melchett Manor to help Prince William deal with educating his children via Zoom and discussing Tiger King, before they both step outside to clap for the NHS."}
{"sequence": "Melchett is said to be isolating with Lord Blackadder, both grandsons to their First World War counterparts In 1998, as part of HRH Prince Charles' 50th Birthday Gala televised on ITV, Atkinson returned to the Cavalier incarnation of Blackadder reading aloud a letter to the Privy Council of King Charles I. He colourfully refuses their invitation to stage a royal gala, calling such occasions \"very, very, very dull\" and asserting that there was \"more musical talent on display when my servant Baldrick breaks wind.\""}
{"sequence": "In 2000, on the BBC's annual Royal Variety Performance, Atkinson portrayed Blackadder as a present-day officer in \"Her Majesty's Royal Regiment of Shirkers\" and delivered a monologue titled \"Blackadder: The Army Years,\" proposing that Britain regain her former greatness by invading (or at least buying) France."}
{"sequence": "In 2012, as part of the Prince's Trust charity show \"We Are Most Amused\", Atkinson and Robinson reprised their roles as Blackadder and Baldrick in a comedy sketch featuring Miranda Hart as leader of a government inquiry into the recent banking crisis."}
{"sequence": "Blackadder, chief executive of a fictional British bank, appearing with Baldrick as his gardener, convinces the panel to publicly blame the entire crisis on Baldrick, to the latter's consternation."}
{"sequence": "Rowan Atkinson and Richard Curtis developed the idea for the sitcom while working on \"Not the Nine O'Clock News\"."}
{"sequence": "Eager to avoid comparisons to the critically acclaimed \"Fawlty Towers\", they proposed the idea of a historical sitcom."}
{"sequence": "An unaired pilot episode was made in 1982, and a six-episode series was commissioned."}
{"sequence": "The budget for the series was considerable, with much location shooting particularly at Alnwick Castle in Northumberland and the surrounding countryside in February 1983."}
{"sequence": "The series also used large casts of extras, horses and expensive medieval-style costumes."}
{"sequence": "Atkinson has said about the making of the first series: The first series was odd, it was very extravagant."}
{"sequence": "It cost a million pounds for the six programmes ... [which] was a lot of money to spend ... It looked great, but it wasn't as consistently funny as we would have liked."}
{"sequence": "Due to the high cost of the first series, the then-controller of programming of BBC1, Michael Grade, was reluctant to sign off a second series without major improvements to the show and drastic cost-cutting, leaving a gap of three years between the two series."}
{"sequence": "Atkinson did not wish to continue writing for the second series."}
{"sequence": "A chance meeting between Richard Curtis and comedian Ben Elton led to the decision to collaborate on a new series of Blackadder."}
{"sequence": "Recognising the main faults of the first series, Curtis and Elton agreed that \"Blackadder II\" would be a studio-only production (along with the inclusion of a live audience during recording, instead of showing the episodes to an audience after taping)."}
{"sequence": "Besides adding a greater comedy focus, Elton suggested a major change in character emphasis: Baldrick would become the stupid sidekick, while Edmund Blackadder evolved into a cunning sycophant."}
{"sequence": "This led to the familiar set-up that was maintained in the following series."}
{"sequence": "Only in the \"Back & Forth\" millennium special was the shooting once again on location, because this was a production with a budget estimated at £3 million, and was a joint venture between Tiger Aspect, Sky Television, the New Millennium Experience Company and the BBC, rather than the BBC alone."}
{"sequence": "Each series tended to feature the same set of regular actors in different period settings, although throughout the four series and specials, only Blackadder and Baldrick were constant characters."}
{"sequence": "Several regular cast members recurred as characters with similar names, implying, like Blackadder, that they were descendants."}
{"sequence": "Various actors have appeared in more than one of the Blackadder series and/or specials."}
{"sequence": "These are: Ben Elton's arrival after the first series heralded the more frequent recruitment of comic actors from the alternative comedy era for guest appearances, including Robbie Coltrane, Rik Mayall (who had appeared in the final episode of the first series as \"Mad Gerald\"), Adrian Edmondson, Nigel Planer, Mark Arden, Stephen Frost, Chris Barrie and Jeremy Hardy."}
{"sequence": "Elton himself played an anarchist in \"Blackadder the Third\"."}
{"sequence": "Gabrielle Glaister played Bob, an attractive girl who poses as a man, in both series 2 and 4."}
{"sequence": "Rik Mayall plays Lord Flashheart, a vulgar friend in his first appearance and then a successful rival of Blackadder in later episodes of series 2 and 4."}
{"sequence": "He also played a decidedly Flashheart-like Robin Hood in \"Back & Forth\"."}
{"sequence": "Lee Cornes also appeared in an episode of all three Curtis-Elton series."}
{"sequence": "He appeared as a guard in the episode \"Chains\" of \"Blackadder II\"; as the poet Shelley in the episode \"Ink and Incapability' of \"Blackadder the Third\"; and as firing squad soldier Private Fraser in the episode \"Corporal Punishment\" of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\"."}
{"sequence": "More established actors, some at the veteran stage of their careers, were also recruited for roles."}
{"sequence": "These included Peter Cook, John Grillo, Simon Jones, Tom Baker, Jim Broadbent, Hugh Paddick, Frank Finlay, Kenneth Connor, Bill Wallis, Ronald Lacey, Roger Blake, Denis Lill, Warren Clarke and Geoffrey Palmer, who played Field Marshal Sir Douglas Haig in \"Goodbyeee\", the final episode of \"Blackadder Goes Forth\"."}
{"sequence": "Miriam Margolyes played three different guest roles: The Spanish Infanta in The Queen of Spain's Beard, Lady Whiteadder in Beer, and Queen Victoria in Blackadder's Christmas Carol."}
{"sequence": "Unusually for a sitcom based loosely on factual events and in the historical past, a man was recruited for one episode essentially to play himself."}
{"sequence": "Political commentator Vincent Hanna played a character billed as \"his own great-great-great grandfather\" in the episode \"Dish and Dishonesty\" of \"Blackadder the Third\"."}
{"sequence": "Hanna was asked to take part because the scene was of a by-election in which Baldrick was a candidate and, in the style of modern television, Hanna gave a long-running \"live\" commentary of events at the count (and interviewed candidates and election agents) to a crowd through the town hall window."}
{"sequence": "Howard Goodall's theme tune has the same melody throughout all the series, but is played in roughly the style of the period in which it is set."}
{"sequence": "It is performed mostly with trumpets and timpani in \"The Black Adder\", the fanfares used suggesting typical medieval court fanfares; with a combination of recorder, string quartet and electric guitar in \"Blackadder II\" (the end theme, with different lyrics each time reflecting on the episode's events, was sung by a countertenor); on oboe, cello and harpsichord (in the style of a minuet) for \"Blackadder the Third\"; by The Band of the 3rd Battalion, Royal Anglian Regiment in \"Blackadder Goes Forth\"; sung by carol singers in \"Blackadder's Christmas Carol\"; and by an orchestra in \"Blackadder: The Cavalier Years\" and \"Blackadder: Back & Forth\"."}
{"sequence": "In 2000, the fourth series, \"Blackadder Goes Forth\", ranked at 16 in the \"100 Greatest British Television Programmes\", a list created by the British Film Institute."}
{"sequence": "In 2004, a BBC TV poll for \"Britain's Best Sitcom\", \"Blackadder\" was voted the second best British sitcom of all time, topped by \"Only Fools and Horses\"."}
{"sequence": "It was also ranked as the 20th Best TV Show of All Time by \"Empire\" magazine."}
{"sequence": "Despite regular statements denying any plans for a fifth series, cast members are regularly asked about the possibility of a new series."}
{"sequence": "In January 2005, Tony Robinson told ITV's \"This Morning\" that Rowan Atkinson was more keen than he has been in the past to do a fifth series, set in the 1960s (centred on a rock band called the \"Black Adder Five\", with Baldrick – a.k.a. '"}
{"sequence": "Bald Rick' – as the drummer)."}
{"sequence": "In the documentary \"Blackadder Rides Again\", Robinson stated that the series would present Blackadder as the bastard son of Queen Elizabeth II and running a Beatles-like rock band."}
{"sequence": "Rowan Atkinson, Tony Robinson, Hugh Laurie, Stephen Fry, Tim McInnerny and Miranda Richardson would have reprised their roles, and reportedly, Brian Blessed, Elspet Gray and Robert East would have returned from the first series to play Blackadder's biological family."}
{"sequence": "Robinson in a stage performance 1 June 2007, again mentioned this idea, but in the context of a movie."}
{"sequence": "One idea mentioned by Curtis was that it was Baldrick who had accidentally assassinated John F. Kennedy."}
{"sequence": "However, aside from a brief mention in June 2005, there have been no further announcements from the BBC that a new series is being planned."}
{"sequence": "Furthermore, in November 2005, Rowan Atkinson told \"BBC Breakfast\" that, although he would very much like to do a new series set in Colditz or another prisoner-of-war camp during World War II, something which both he and Stephen Fry reiterated at the end of \"Blackadder Rides Again\", the chances of it happening are extremely slim."}
{"sequence": "There were a couple of ideas that had previously floated for the fifth series. \""}
{"sequence": "Batadder\" was intended to be a parody of \"Batman\" with Baldrick as the counterpart of Robin (suggested by John Lloyd)."}
{"sequence": "This idea eventually came to surface as part of the \"Comic Relief\" sketch \"Spider-Plant Man\" in 2005, with Atkinson as the title hero, Robinson as Robin, Jim Broadbent as Batman and Rachel Stevens as Mary Jane. \""}
{"sequence": "Star Adder\" was to be set in space in the future (suggested by Atkinson), though this too was touched upon in \"Blackadder's Christmas Carol\"."}
{"sequence": "On 10 April 2007, \"Hello!\""}
{"sequence": "reported that Atkinson was moving forward with his ideas for a fifth series."}
{"sequence": "He said, \"I like the idea of him being a prisoner of war in Colditz."}
{"sequence": "That would have the right level of authority and hierarchy which is apparent in all the Blackadders.\""}
{"sequence": "A post on BlackAdderHall.com by Ben Elton in early 2007 said that \"Blackadder\" would return in some form, whether it be a TV series or film."}
{"sequence": "Elton has since not given any more information on the putative \"Blackadder 5\"."}
{"sequence": "During an interview in August 2007 about his film \"Mr. Bean's Holiday\", Atkinson was asked about the possibility of a further \"Blackadder\" series, to which the simple reply \"No, no chance\" was given: Stephen Fry has expressed the view that, since the series went out on such a good \"high\", a film might not be a good idea."}
{"sequence": "During his June 2007 stage performance, chronicled on the Tony Robinson's Cunning Night Out DVD, Robinson states that, after filming the \"Back & Forth special\", the general idea was to reunite for another special in 2010."}
{"sequence": "Robinson jokingly remarked that Hugh Laurie's success on \"House\" may make that difficult."}
{"sequence": "At the end of \"Blackadder Rides Again\", Robinson asked Tim McInnerny if he would do another series and he responded \"no\", because he thought people would not want to see them as they are now and would rather remember them for how they were."}
{"sequence": "In the same documentary, Rowan Atkinson voiced his similar view; 'Times past; that's what they were!'"}
{"sequence": "However, Miranda Richardson and Tony Robinson expressed enthusiasm towards the idea of a series set in the Wild West, whilst John Lloyd favoured an idea for a series with a Neanderthal Blackadder."}
{"sequence": "Lastly, Stephen Fry suggested a series set in a prisoner of war camp during World War II, but later remarked that \"perhaps it's best to leave these things as a memory.\""}
{"sequence": "On 28 November 2012, Rowan Atkinson reprised the role at the \"We are most amused\" comedy gala for the Prince's Trust at the Royal Albert Hall."}
{"sequence": "He was joined by Tony Robinson as Baldrick."}
{"sequence": "The sketch involved Blackadder as CEO of Melchett, Melchett and Darling bank facing an enquiry over the banking crisis."}
{"sequence": "In August 2015, Tony Robinson said in an interview \"I do think a new series of Blackadder is on the cards."}
{"sequence": "I have spoken to virtually all the cast about this now."}
{"sequence": "The only problem is Hugh [Laurie]'s fee."}
{"sequence": "He's a huge star now.\""}
{"sequence": "However, in October 2018, Richard Curtis \"dashed hopes\" that the show would return for a fifth series."}
{"sequence": "All series and many of the specials are available on DVD and video."}
{"sequence": "Many are also available on BBC audio cassette."}
{"sequence": "As of 2008, a \"Best of BBC\" edition box set is available containing all four major series together with \"Blackadder's Christmas Carol\" and \"Back & Forth\"."}
{"sequence": "All four series and the Christmas special are also available for download on iTunes."}

{"sequence": "Boii The Boii (Latin plural, singular \"Boius\"; ) were a Gallic tribe of the later Iron Age, attested at various times in Cisalpine Gaul (northern Italy), Pannonia (Hungary), parts of Bavaria, in and around Bohemia (after whom the region is named in most languages; comprising the bulk of Czechia), parts of Poland, and Gallia Narbonensis."}
{"sequence": "In addition the archaeological evidence indicates that in the 2nd century BC Celts expanded from Bohemia through the Kłodzko Valley into Silesia, now part of Poland and Czechia."}
{"sequence": "They first appear in history in connection with the Gallic invasion of north Italy, 390 BC, when they made the Etruscan city of Felsina their new capital, Bononia (Bologna)."}
{"sequence": "After a series of wars they were decisively beaten by the Romans in a Battle of Mutina (193 BC) and their territory became part of the Roman province of Cisalpine Gaul."}
{"sequence": "According to Strabo, writing two centuries after the events, rather than being destroyed by the Romans like their Celtic neighbours, Around 60 BC, a group of Boii joined the Helvetiis' ill-fated attempt to conquer land in western Gaul and were defeated by Julius Caesar, along with their allies, in the Battle of Bibracte."}
{"sequence": "Caesar settled the remnants of that group in Gorgobina, from where they sent two thousand to Vercingetorix's aid at the Battle of Alesia six years later."}
{"sequence": "The eastern Boii on the Danube were incorporated into the Roman Empire in 8 AD."}
{"sequence": "There are two major derivations of this segment, both presupposing that it belongs to the family of Indo-European languages: from 'cow' and from 'warrior.'"}
{"sequence": "The Boii would thus be either \"the herding people\" or \"the warrior people\"."}
{"sequence": "In a reference to the first known historical Boii, Polybius relates that their wealth consisted of cattle and gold, that they depended on agriculture and war, and that a man's status depended on the number of associates and assistants he had."}
{"sequence": "The latter were presumably the \"*ambouii\", as opposed to the man of status, who was \"*bouios\", a cattle owner, and the \"*bouii\" were originally a class, \"the cattle owners\"."}
{"sequence": "Such a connection is possible if the original form of \"Boii\" belonged to a tribe of Proto-Indo-European speakers long before the time of the historic Boii."}
{"sequence": "If that is the case, then the Celtic tribe of central Europe must have been a final daughter population of a linguistically-diversified ancestor tribe."}
{"sequence": "The same wider connections can be hypothesized for the \"cow\" derivation: the Boeotians have been known for well over a century as a people of kine, which might have been parallel to the meaning of Italy as a \"land of calves\"."}
{"sequence": "Contemporary derived words include \"Boiorix\" (\"king of the Boii\", one of the chieftains of the Cimbri) and \"Boiodurum\" (\"gate/fort of the Boii\", modern Passau) in Germany."}
{"sequence": "According to the ancient authors, the Boii arrived in northern Italy by crossing the Alps."}
{"sequence": "While of the other tribes who had come to Italy along with the Boii, the Senones, Lingones and Cenomani are also attested in Gaul at the time of the Roman conquest."}
{"sequence": "It remains therefore unclear where exactly the Central European origins of the Boii lay, if somewhere in Gaul, Southern Germany or in Bohemia."}
{"sequence": "Polybius relates that the Celts were close neighbors of the Etruscan civilization and \"cast covetous eyes on their beautiful country\"."}
{"sequence": "Invading the Po Valley with a large army, they drove out the Etruscans and resettled it, the Boii taking the right bank in the center of the valley."}
{"sequence": "Strabo confirms that the Boii emigrated from their lands across the Alps and were one of the largest tribes of the Celts."}
{"sequence": "The Boii occupied the old Etruscan settlement of Felsina, which they named \"Bononia\" (modern Bologna)."}
{"sequence": "Polybius describes the Celtic way of life in Cisalpine Gaul as follows: The archaeological evidence from Bologna and its vicinity contradicts the testimony of Polybius and Livy on some points, who say the Boii expelled the Etruscans and perhaps some were forced to leave."}
{"sequence": "It much rather indicates that the Boii neither destroyed nor depopulated Felsinum, but simply moved in and became part of the population by intermarriage."}
{"sequence": "The cemeteries of the period in Bologna contain La Tène weapons and other artifacts, as well as Etruscan items such as bronze mirrors."}
{"sequence": "At Monte Bibele not far away one grave contained La Tène weapons and a pot with an Etruscan female name scratched on it."}
{"sequence": "In the second half of the 3rd century BC, the Boii allied with the other Cisalpine Gauls and the Etruscans against Rome."}
{"sequence": "They also fought alongside Hannibal, killing the Roman general Lucius Postumius Albinus in 216 BC, whose skull was then turned into a sacrificial bowl."}
{"sequence": "A short time earlier, they had been defeated at the Battle of Telamon in 225 BC, and were again at Placentia in 194 BC (modern Piacenza) and Mutina in 193 BC (modern Modena)."}
{"sequence": "Publius Cornelius Scipio Nasica completed the Roman conquest of the Boii in 191 BC, celebrating a triumph for it."}
{"sequence": "After their losses, according to Strabo, a large portion of the Boii left Italy."}
{"sequence": "Contrary to the interpretation of the classical writers, the Pannonian Boii attested in later sources are not simply the remnants of those who had fled from Italy, but rather another division of the tribe, which had settled there much earlier."}
{"sequence": "The burial rites of the Italian Boii show many similarities with contemporary Bohemia, such as inhumation, which was uncommon with the other Cisalpine Gauls, or the absence of the typically western Celtic torcs."}
{"sequence": "This makes it much more likely that the Cisalpine Boii had actually originated from Bohemia rather than the other way round."}
{"sequence": "Having migrated to Italy from north of the Alps, some of the defeated Celts simply moved back to their kinsfolk."}
{"sequence": "The Pannonian Boii are mentioned again in the late 2nd century BC when they repelled the Cimbri and Teutones (Strabo VII, 2, 2)."}
{"sequence": "Later on, they attacked the city of Noreia (in modern Austria) shortly before a group of Boii (32,000 according to Julius Caesar – the number is probably an exaggeration) joined the Helvetii in their attempt to settle in western Gaul."}
{"sequence": "After the Helvetian defeat at Bibracte, the influential Aedui tribe allowed the Boii survivors to settle on their territory, where they occupied the \"oppidum\" of Gorgobina."}
{"sequence": "Although attacked by Vercingetorix during one phase of the war, they supported him with two thousand troops at the battle of Alesia (Caesar, \"Commentarii de Bello Gallico\", VII, 75)."}
{"sequence": "Again, other parts of the Boii had remained closer to their traditional home, and settled in the Slovak and Hungarian lowlands by the Danube and the Mura, with a centre at Bratislava."}
{"sequence": "Around 60 BC they clashed with the rising power of the Dacians under their king Burebista and were defeated."}
{"sequence": "When the Romans finally conquered Pannonia in 8 AD, the Boii seem not to have opposed them."}
{"sequence": "Their former territory was now called \"deserta Boiorum\" (deserta meaning 'empty or sparsely populated lands')."}
{"sequence": "However, the Boii had not been exterminated: There was a \"civitas Boiorum et Azaliorum\" (the Azalii being a neighbouring tribe) which was under the jurisdiction of a prefect of the Danube shore (\"praefectus ripae Danuvii\")."}
{"sequence": "Plautus refers to the Boii in \"Captivi\": There is a play on words: \"Boia\" means \"woman of the Boii\", also \"convicted criminal's restraint collar\"."}
{"sequence": "In volume 21 of his \"History of Rome\", Livy (59 BC – 17 AD) claims that it was a Boio man that offered to show Hannibal the way across the Alps."}
{"sequence": "In the first century BC, the Boii living in an oppidum of Bratislava minted Biatecs, high-quality coins with inscriptions (probably the names of kings) in Latin letters."}
{"sequence": "This is the only \"written source\" provided by the Boii themselves."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon Backgammon is one of the oldest known board games."}
{"sequence": "Its history can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to archaeological discoveries in Mesopotamia."}
{"sequence": "It is a two-player game where each player has fifteen pieces (\"checkers\" or \"men\") that move between twenty-four triangles (\"points\") according to the roll of two dice."}
{"sequence": "The objective of the game is to be first to \"bear off\", i.e. move all fifteen checkers off the board."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon is a member of the tables family, one of the oldest classes of board games."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon involves a combination of strategy and luck (from rolling dice)."}
{"sequence": "While the dice may determine the outcome of a single game, the better player will accumulate the better record over series of many games."}
{"sequence": "With each roll of the dice, players must choose from numerous options for moving their checkers and anticipate possible counter-moves by the opponent."}
{"sequence": "The optional use of a doubling cube allows players to raise the stakes during the game."}
{"sequence": "Like chess, backgammon has been studied with great interest by computer scientists."}
{"sequence": "Owing to this research, backgammon software has been developed that is capable of beating world-class human players (see TD-Gammon for an example)."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon is not controlled by a dominating authority, yet the \"rules of play\" are agreed on by the international tournaments."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon playing pieces may be termed checkers, draughts, stones, men, counters, pawns, discs, pips, chips, or nips."}
{"sequence": "The objective is for players to remove (\"bear off\") all their checkers from the board before their opponent can do the same."}
{"sequence": "As the playing time for each individual game is short, it is often played in matches where victory is awarded to the first player to reach a certain number of points."}
{"sequence": "Each side of the board has a track of 12 long triangles, called points."}
{"sequence": "The points form a continuous track in the shape of a horseshoe, and are numbered from 1 to 24."}
{"sequence": "In the most commonly used setup, each player begins with fifteen chips, two are placed on their 24-point, three on their 8-point, and five each on their 13-point and their 6-point."}
{"sequence": "The two players move their chips in opposing directions, from the 24-point towards the 1-point."}
{"sequence": "Points 1 through 6 are called the home board or inner board, and points 7 through 12 are called the outer board."}
{"sequence": "The 7-point is referred to as the bar point, and the 13-point as the midpoint."}
{"sequence": "Usually the 5-point for each player is called the \"golden point\"."}
{"sequence": "To start the game, each player rolls one die, and the player with the higher number moves first using the numbers shown on both dice."}
{"sequence": "If the players roll the same number, they must roll again."}
{"sequence": "Both dice must land completely flat on the right-hand side of the gameboard."}
{"sequence": "The players then take alternate turns, rolling two dice at the beginning of each turn."}
{"sequence": "After rolling the dice, players must, if possible, move their checkers according to the number shown on each die."}
{"sequence": "For example, if the player rolls a 6 and a 3 (denoted as \"6-3\"), the player must move one checker six points forward, and another or the same checker three points forward."}
{"sequence": "The same checker may be moved twice, as long as the two moves can be made separately and legally: six and then three, or three and then six."}
{"sequence": "If a player rolls two of the same number, called doubles, that player must play each die twice."}
{"sequence": "For example, a roll of 5-5 allows the player to make four moves of five spaces each."}
{"sequence": "On any roll, a player must move according to the numbers on both dice if it is at all possible to do so."}
{"sequence": "If one or both numbers do not allow a legal move, the player forfeits that portion of the roll and the turn ends."}
{"sequence": "If moves can be made according to either one die or the other, but not both, the higher number must be used."}
{"sequence": "If one die is unable to be moved, but such a move is made possible by the moving of the other die, that move is compulsory."}
{"sequence": "In the course of a move, a checker may land on any point that is unoccupied or is occupied by one or more of the player's own checkers."}
{"sequence": "It may also land on a point occupied by exactly one opposing checker, or \"blot\"."}
{"sequence": "In this case, the blot has been \"hit\", and is placed in the middle of the board on the bar that divides the two sides of the playing surface."}
{"sequence": "A checker may never land on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers; thus, no point is ever occupied by checkers from both players simultaneously."}
{"sequence": "There is no limit to the number of checkers that can occupy a point at any given time."}
{"sequence": "Checkers placed on the bar must re-enter the game through the opponent's home board before any other move can be made."}
{"sequence": "A roll of 1 allows the checker to enter on the 24-point (opponent's 1), a roll of 2 on the 23-point (opponent's 2), and so forth, up to a roll of 6 allowing entry on the 19-point (opponent's 6)."}
{"sequence": "Checkers may not enter on a point occupied by two or more opposing checkers."}
{"sequence": "Checkers can enter on unoccupied points, or on points occupied by a single opposing checker; in the latter case, the single checker is hit and placed on the bar."}
{"sequence": "More than one checker can be on the bar at a time."}
{"sequence": "A player may not move any other checkers until all checkers on the bar belonging to that player have re-entered the board."}
{"sequence": "If a player has checkers on the bar, but rolls a combination that does not allow any of those checkers to re-enter, the player does not move."}
{"sequence": "If the opponent's home board is completely \"closed\" (i.e. all six points are each occupied by two or more checkers), there is no roll that will allow a player to enter a checker from the bar, and that player stops rolling and playing until at least one point becomes open (occupied by one or zero checkers) due to the opponent's moves."}
{"sequence": "When all of a player's checkers are in that player's home board, that player may start removing them; this is called \"bearing off\"."}
{"sequence": "A roll of 1 may be used to bear off a checker from the 1-point, a 2 from the 2-point, and so on."}
{"sequence": "If all of a player's checkers are on points lower than the number showing on a particular die, the player must use that die to bear off one checker from the highest occupied point."}
{"sequence": "For example, if a player rolls a 6 and a 5, but has no checkers on the 6-point and two on the 5-point, then the 6 and the 5 must be used to bear off the two checkers from the 5-point."}
{"sequence": "When bearing off, a player may also move a lower die roll before the higher even if that means the full value of the higher die is not fully utilized."}
{"sequence": "For example, if a player has exactly one checker remaining on the 6-point, and rolls a 6 and a 1, the player may move the 6-point checker one place to the 5-point with the lower die roll of 1, and then bear that checker off the 5-point using the die roll of 6; this is sometimes useful tactically."}
{"sequence": "As before, if there is a way to use all moves showing on the dice by moving checkers within the home board or by bearing them off, the player must do so."}
{"sequence": "If a player's checker is hit while in the process of bearing off, that player may not bear off any others until it has been re-entered into the game and moved into the player's home board, according to the normal movement rules."}
{"sequence": "The first player to bear off all fifteen of their own checkers wins the game."}
{"sequence": "If the opponent has not yet borne off any checkers when the game ends, the winner scores a \"gammon\", which counts for double stakes."}
{"sequence": "If the opponent has not yet borne off any checkers and has some on the bar or in the winner's home board, the winner scores a \"backgammon\", which counts for triple stakes."}
{"sequence": "To speed up match play and to provide an added dimension for strategy, a doubling cube is usually used."}
{"sequence": "The doubling cube is not a die to be rolled, but rather a marker, with the numbers 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and 64 inscribed on its sides to denote the current stake."}
{"sequence": "At the start of each game, the doubling cube is placed on the midpoint of the bar with the number 64 showing; the cube is then said to be \"centered, on 1\"."}
{"sequence": "When the cube is centered, either player may start their turn by proposing that the game be played for twice the current stakes."}
{"sequence": "Their opponent must either accept (\"take\") the doubled stakes or resign (\"drop\") the game immediately."}
{"sequence": "Whenever a player accepts doubled stakes, the cube is placed on their side of the board with the corresponding power of two facing upward, to indicate that the right to re-double belongs exclusively to that player."}
{"sequence": "If the opponent drops the doubled stakes, he or she loses the game at the current value of the doubling cube."}
{"sequence": "For instance, if the cube showed the number 2 and a player wanted to redouble the stakes to put it at 4, the opponent choosing to drop the redouble would lose two, or twice the original stake."}
{"sequence": "There is no limit on the number of redoubles."}
{"sequence": "Although 64 is the highest number depicted on the doubling cube, the stakes may rise to 128, 256, and so on."}
{"sequence": "In money games, a player is often permitted to \"beaver\" when offered the cube, doubling the value of the game again, while retaining possession of the cube."}
{"sequence": "A variant of the doubling cube \"beaver\" is the \"raccoon\"."}
{"sequence": "Players who doubled their opponent, seeing the opponent beaver the cube, may in turn then double the stakes once again (\"raccoon\") as part of that cube phase before any dice are rolled."}
{"sequence": "The opponent retains the doubling cube."}
{"sequence": "An example of a \"raccoon\" is the following: White doubles Black to 2 points, Black accepts then beavers the cube to 4 points; White, confident of a win, raccoons the cube to 8 points, while Black retains the cube."}
{"sequence": "Such a move adds greatly to the risk of having to face the doubling cube coming back at 8 times its original value when first doubling the opponent (offered at 2 points, counter offered at 16 points) should the luck of the dice change."}
{"sequence": "Some players may opt to invoke the \"Murphy rule\" or the \"automatic double rule\"."}
{"sequence": "If both opponents roll the same opening number, the doubling cube is incremented on each occasion yet remains in the middle of the board, available to either player."}
{"sequence": "The Murphy rule may be invoked with a maximum number of automatic doubles allowed and that limit is agreed to prior to a game or match commencing."}
{"sequence": "When a player decides to double the opponent, the value is then a double of whatever face value is shown (e.g. if two automatic doubles have occurred putting the cube up to 4, the first in-game double will be for 8 points)."}
{"sequence": "The Murphy rule is not an official rule in backgammon and is rarely, if ever, seen in use at officially sanctioned tournaments."}
{"sequence": "The \"Jacoby rule\", named after Oswald Jacoby, allows gammons and backgammons to count for their respective double and triple values only if the cube has already been offered and accepted."}
{"sequence": "This encourages a player with a large lead to double, possibly ending the game, rather than to play it to conclusion hoping for a gammon or backgammon."}
{"sequence": "The Jacoby rule is widely used in money play but is not used in match play."}
{"sequence": "The \"Crawford rule\", named after John R. Crawford, is designed to make match play more equitable for the player in the lead."}
{"sequence": "If a player is one point away from winning a match, that player's opponent will always want to double as early as possible in order to catch up."}
{"sequence": "Whether the game is worth one point or two, the trailing player must win to continue the match."}
{"sequence": "To balance the situation, the Crawford rule requires that when a player first reaches a score one point short of winning, neither player may use the doubling cube for the following game, called the \"Crawford game\"."}
{"sequence": "After the Crawford game, normal use of the doubling cube resumes."}
{"sequence": "The Crawford rule is routinely used in tournament match play."}
{"sequence": "It is possible for a Crawford game to never occur in a match."}
{"sequence": "If the Crawford rule is in effect, then another option is the \"Holland rule\", named after Tim Holland, which stipulates that after the Crawford game, a player cannot double until after at least two rolls have been played by each side."}
{"sequence": "It was common in tournament play in the 1980s, but is now rarely used."}
{"sequence": "There are many variants of standard backgammon rules."}
{"sequence": "Some are played primarily throughout one geographic region, and others add new tactical elements to the game."}
{"sequence": "Variants commonly alter the starting position, restrict certain moves, or assign special value to certain dice rolls, but in some geographic regions even the rules and directions of the checkers' movement change, rendering the game fundamentally different."}
{"sequence": "\"Acey-deucey\" is a variant of backgammon in which players start with no checkers on the board, and must bear them on at the beginning of the game."}
{"sequence": "The roll of 1-2 is given special consideration, allowing the player, after moving the 1 and the 2, to select any desired doubles move."}
{"sequence": "A player also receives an extra turn after a roll of 1-2 or of doubles."}
{"sequence": "\"Hypergammon\" is a variant of backgammon in which players have only three checkers on the board, starting with one each on the 24, 23 and 22 points."}
{"sequence": "The game has been strongly solved, meaning that exact equities are available for all 32 million possible positions."}
{"sequence": "\"Nard\" is a traditional variant from Persia in which basic rules are almost the same except that even a single piece is \"safe\"."}
{"sequence": "All 15 pieces start on the 24th wedge."}
{"sequence": "\"Nackgammon\" is a variant of backgammon invented by Nick \"Nack\" Ballard in which players start with one less checker on the 6-point and midpoint and two checkers on the 23-point."}
{"sequence": "\"Russian backgammon\" is a variant described in 1895 as: \"...much in vogue in Russia, Germany, and other parts of the Continent...\"."}
{"sequence": "Players start with no checkers on the board, and both players move in the same direction to bear off in a common home board."}
{"sequence": "In this variant, doubles are more powerful: four moves are played as in standard backgammon, followed by four moves according to the difference of the dice value from 7, and then the player has another turn (with the caveat that the turn ends if any portion of it cannot be completed)."}
{"sequence": "\"Gul bara\" and \"Tapa\" are also variants of the game popular in southeastern Europe and Turkey."}
{"sequence": "The play will iterate among Backgammon, Gul Bara, and Tapa until one of the players reaches a score of 7 or 5."}
{"sequence": "\"Coan ki\" is an ancient Chinese board game that is very similar."}
{"sequence": "\"Plakoto\", \"Fevga\" and \"Portes\" are three versions of backgammon played in Greece."}
{"sequence": "Together, the three are referred to as \"Tavli\"."}
{"sequence": "\"Misere (backgammon to lose)\" is a variant of backgammon in which the objective is to lose the game."}
{"sequence": "\"Tavla\" is a Turkish variation."}
{"sequence": "Other minor variants to the standard game are common among casual players in certain regions."}
{"sequence": "For instance, only allowing a maximum of five checkers on any point (Britain) or disallowing \"hit-and-run\" in the home board (Middle East)."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon has an established opening theory, although it is less detailed than that of chess."}
{"sequence": "The tree of positions expands rapidly because of the number of possible dice rolls and the moves available on each turn."}
{"sequence": "Recent computer analysis has offered more insight on opening plays, but the midgame is reached quickly."}
{"sequence": "After the opening, backgammon players frequently rely on some established general strategies, combining and switching among them to adapt to the changing conditions of a game."}
{"sequence": "A blot has the highest probability of being hit when it is 6 points away from an opponent's checker (see picture)."}
{"sequence": "Strategies can derive from that."}
{"sequence": "The most direct one is simply to avoid being hit, trapped, or held in a stand-off."}
{"sequence": "A \"running game\" describes a strategy of moving as quickly as possible around the board, and is most successful when a player is already ahead in the race."}
{"sequence": "When this fails, one may opt for a \"holding game\", maintaining control of a point on one's opponent's side of the board, called an anchor."}
{"sequence": "As the game progresses, this player may gain an advantage by hitting an opponent's blot from the anchor, or by rolling large doubles that allow the checkers to escape into a running game."}
{"sequence": "The \"priming game\" involves building a wall of checkers, called a prime, covering a number of consecutive points."}
{"sequence": "This obstructs opposing checkers that are behind the prime."}
{"sequence": "A checker trapped behind a six-point prime cannot escape until the prime is broken."}
{"sequence": "A particularly successful priming effort may lead to a \"blitz\", which is a strategy of covering the entire home board as quickly as possible while keeping one's opponent on the bar."}
{"sequence": "Because the opponent has difficulty re-entering from the bar or escaping, a player can quickly gain a running advantage and win the game, often with a gammon."}
{"sequence": "A \"backgame\" is a strategy that involves holding two or more anchors in an opponent's home board while being substantially behind in the race."}
{"sequence": "The anchors obstruct the opponent's checkers and create opportunities to hit them as they move home."}
{"sequence": "The backgame is generally used only to salvage a game wherein a player is already significantly behind."}
{"sequence": "Using a backgame as an initial strategy is usually unsuccessful."}
{"sequence": "\"Duplication\" refers to the placement of checkers such that one's opponent needs the same dice rolls to achieve different goals."}
{"sequence": "For example, players may position all of their blots in such a way that the opponent must roll a 2 in order to hit any of them, reducing the probability of being hit more than once. \""}
{"sequence": "Diversification\" refers to a complementary tactic of placing one's own checkers in such a way that more numbers are useful."}
{"sequence": "Many positions require a measurement of a player's standing in the race, for example, in making a doubling cube decision, or in determining whether to run home and begin bearing off."}
{"sequence": "The minimum total of pips needed to move a player's checkers around and off the board is called the \"pip count\"."}
{"sequence": "The difference between the two players' pip counts is frequently used as a measure of the leader's racing advantage."}
{"sequence": "Players often use mental calculation techniques to determine pip counts in live play."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon is played in two principal variations, \"money\" and \"match\" play."}
{"sequence": "Money play means that every point counts evenly and every game stands alone, whether money is actually being wagered or not. \""}
{"sequence": "Match\" play means that the players play until one side scores (or exceeds) a certain number of points."}
{"sequence": "The format has a significant effect on strategy."}
{"sequence": "In a match, the objective is not to win the maximum possible number of points, but rather to simply reach the score needed to win the match."}
{"sequence": "For example, a player leading a 9-point match by a score of 7–5 would be very reluctant to turn the doubling cube, as their opponent could take and make a costless redouble to 4, placing the entire outcome of the match on the current game."}
{"sequence": "Conversely, the trailing player would double very aggressively, particularly if they have chances to win a gammon in the current game."}
{"sequence": "In money play, the theoretically correct checker play and cube action would never vary based on the score."}
{"sequence": "In 1975, Emmet Keeler and Joel Spencer considered the question of when to double or accept a double using an idealized version of backgammon."}
{"sequence": "In their idealized version, the probability of winning varies randomly over time by Brownian motion, and there are no gammons or backgammons."}
{"sequence": "They showed that the optimal time to offer a double was when the probability of winning reached 80%, and it is wise to accept a double only if the probability of winning is at least 20%."}
{"sequence": "As their assumptions do not correspond perfectly to the real game, actual doubling strategy may vary, but the 80% number still provides a possible rule of thumb."}
{"sequence": "To reduce the possibility of cheating, most good quality backgammon sets use precision dice and a dice cup."}
{"sequence": "This reduces the likelihood of loaded dice being used, which is the main way of cheating in face-to-face play."}
{"sequence": "A common method of cheating online is the use of a computer program to find the optimal move on each turn; to combat this, many online sites use move-comparison software that identifies when a player's moves resemble those of a backgammon program."}
{"sequence": "Online cheating has therefore become extremely difficult."}
{"sequence": "In \"State of Oregon v. Barr\", a 1982 court case pivotal to the continued widespread organised playing of backgammon in the US, the State argued that backgammon is a game of chance and that it was therefore subject to Oregon's stringent gambling laws."}
{"sequence": "Paul Magriel was a key witness for the defence, contradicting Roger Nelson, the expert prosecution witness, by saying, \"Game theory, however, really applies to games with imperfect knowledge, where something is concealed, such as poker."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon is not such a game."}
{"sequence": "Everything is in front of you."}
{"sequence": "The person who uses that information in the most effective manner will win.\""}
{"sequence": "After the closing arguments, Judge Stephen S. Walker concluded that backgammon is a game of skill, not a game of chance, and found the defendant, backgammon tournament director Ted Barr, not guilty of promoting gambling."}
{"sequence": "Early Muslim scholars forbade backgammon."}
{"sequence": "The prohibition was based on sayings attributed to the Prophet Muhammad regarding gambling in general and backgammon in particular, such as: \"Whoever plays backgammon it is as if he puts his hand in the pork and pig's blood.\""}
{"sequence": "Contemporary Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani of Iraq, one of the prominent religious leaders of Shia Muslims, issued a ruling that chess (and by implication backgammon) \"is absolutely forbidden even without placing a bet\"."}
{"sequence": "Enthusiasts have formed clubs for social play of backgammon."}
{"sequence": "Local clubs may hold informal gatherings, with members meeting at cafés and bars in the evening to play and converse."}
{"sequence": "A few clubs offer additional services, maintaining their own facilities or offering computer analysis of troublesome plays."}
{"sequence": "Around 2003, some club leaders noticed a growth of interest in backgammon, and attributed it to the game's popularity on the Internet."}
{"sequence": "A backgammon chouette permits three or more players to participate in a single game, often for money."}
{"sequence": "One player competes against a team of all the other participants, and positions rotate after each game."}
{"sequence": "Chouette play often permits the use of multiple doubling cubes."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon clubs may also organize tournaments."}
{"sequence": "Large club tournaments sometimes draw competitors from other regions, with final matches viewed by hundreds of spectators."}
{"sequence": "The top players at regional tournaments often compete in major national and international championships."}
{"sequence": "Winners at major tournaments may receive prizes of tens of thousands of dollars."}
{"sequence": "Starting in January 2018, tournament directors began awarding GammonPoints, a free points registry for tournament directors and players, with GammonPoint awards based on the number of players and strength of field."}
{"sequence": "The first world championship competition in backgammon was held in Las Vegas, Nevada in 1967."}
{"sequence": "Tim Holland was declared the winner that year and at the tournament the following year."}
{"sequence": "For unknown reasons, there was no championship in 1970, but in 1971, Tim Holland again won the title."}
{"sequence": "The competition remained in Las Vegas until 1975, when it moved to Paradise Island in the Bahamas."}
{"sequence": "The years 1976, 1977 & 1978 saw \"dual\" World Championships, one in the Bahamas attended by the Americans, and the \"European Open Championships\" in Monte Carlo with mostly European players."}
{"sequence": "In 1979, Lewis Deyong, who had promoted the Bahamas World Championship for the prior three years, suggested that the two events be combined."}
{"sequence": "Monte Carlo was universally acknowledged as the site of the World Backgammon Championship and has remained as such for thirty years."}
{"sequence": "The Monte Carlo tournament draws hundreds of players and spectators, and is played over the course of a week."}
{"sequence": "By the 21st century, the largest international tournaments had established the basis of a tour for top professional players."}
{"sequence": "Major tournaments are held yearly worldwide."}
{"sequence": "PartyGaming sponsored the first World Series of Backgammon in 2006 from Cannes and later the \"Backgammon Million\" tournament held in the Bahamas in January 2007 with a prize pool of one million dollars, the largest for any tournament to date."}
{"sequence": "In 2008, the World Series of Backgammon ran the world's largest international events in London, the UK Masters, the biggest tournament ever held in the UK with 128 international class players; the Nordic Open, which instantly became the largest in the world with around 500 players in all flights and 153 in the championship, and Cannes, which hosted the Riviera Cup, the traditional follow-up tournament to the World Championships."}
{"sequence": "Cannes also hosted the WSOB championship, the WSOB finale, which saw 16 players play three-point shootout matches for €160,000."}
{"sequence": "The event was recorded for television in Europe and aired on Eurosport."}
{"sequence": "The World Backgammon Association (WBA) has been holding the biggest backgammon tour on the circuit since 2007, the \"European Backgammon Tour\" (EBGT)."}
{"sequence": "In 2011, the WBA collaborated with the online backgammon provider Play65 for the 2011 season of the European Backgammon Tour and with \"Betfair\" in 2012."}
{"sequence": "The 2013 season of the European Backgammon Tour featured 11 stops and 19 qualified players competing for €19,000 in a grand finale in Lefkosa, Northern Cyprus."}
{"sequence": "When backgammon is played for money, the most common arrangement is to assign a monetary value to each point, and to play to a certain score, or until either player chooses to stop."}
{"sequence": "The stakes are raised by gammons, backgammons, and use of the doubling cube."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon is sometimes available in casinos."}
{"sequence": "Before the commercialization of artificial neural network programs, proposition bets on specific positions were very common among backgammon players and gamblers."}
{"sequence": "As with most gambling games, successful play requires a combination of luck and skill, as a single dice roll can sometimes significantly change the outcome of the game."}
{"sequence": "The game is included in for the Nintendo Switch, a collection of tabletop games."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon software has been developed not only to play and analyze games, but also to facilitate play between humans over the internet."}
{"sequence": "Dice rolls are provided by random or pseudorandom number generators."}
{"sequence": "Real-time online play began with the First Internet Backgammon Server in July 1992, but there are now a range of options, many of which are commercial."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon has been studied considerably by computer scientists."}
{"sequence": "Neural networks and other approaches have offered significant advances to software for gameplay and analysis."}
{"sequence": "The first strong computer opponent was BKG 9.8."}
{"sequence": "It was written by Hans Berliner in the late 1970s on a DEC PDP-10 as an experiment in evaluating board game positions."}
{"sequence": "Early versions of BKG played badly even against poor players, but Berliner noticed that its critical mistakes were always at transitional phases in the game."}
{"sequence": "He applied principles of fuzzy logic to improve its play between phases, and by July 1979, BKG 9.8 was strong enough to play against the reigning world champion Luigi Villa."}
{"sequence": "It won the match 7–1, becoming the first computer program to defeat a world champion in any board game."}
{"sequence": "Berliner stated that the victory was largely a matter of luck, as the computer received more favorable dice rolls."}
{"sequence": "In the late 1980s, backgammon programmers found more success with an approach based on artificial neural networks."}
{"sequence": "TD-Gammon, developed by Gerald Tesauro of IBM, was the first of these programs to play near the expert level."}
{"sequence": "Its neural network was trained using temporal difference learning applied to data generated from self-play."}
{"sequence": "According to assessments by Bill Robertie and Kit Woolsey, TD-Gammon's play was at or above the level of the top human players in the world."}
{"sequence": "Woolsey said of the program that \"There is no question in my mind that its positional judgment is far better than mine.\""}
{"sequence": "Tesauro proposed using rollout analysis to compare the performance of computer algorithms against human players."}
{"sequence": "In this method, a Monte-Carlo evaluation of positions is conducted (typically thousands of trials) where different random dice sequences are simulated."}
{"sequence": "The rollout score of the human (or the computer) is the difference of the average game results by following the selected move versus following the best move, then averaged for the entire set of taken moves."}
{"sequence": "Neural network research has resulted in three modern proprietary programs, JellyFish, Snowie and eXtreme Gammon, as well as the shareware BGBlitz and the free software GNU Backgammon."}
{"sequence": "These programs not only play the game, but offer tools for analyzing games and detailed comparisons of individual moves."}
{"sequence": "The strength of these programs lies in their neural networks' weights tables, which are the result of months of training."}
{"sequence": "Without them, these programs play no better than a human novice."}
{"sequence": "For the bearoff phase, backgammon software usually relies on a database containing precomputed equities for all possible bearoff positions."}
{"sequence": "Computer-versus-computer competitions are also held at Computer Olympiad events."}
{"sequence": "The artifacts included two dice and 60 checkers, and the set is believed to be 100 to 200 years older than the Royal Game of Ur."}
{"sequence": "On the board found at Shahr-e Sukhteh, the fields are represented by the coils of a snake."}
{"sequence": "Board game artifacts found at Jiroft, from about 2000 BC, may represent a game that is more closely related to modern backgammon than those found at Shahr-e Sukhteh and Ur."}
{"sequence": "Touraj Daryaee—on the subject of the first written mention of early precursors of backgammon—writes: In the 11th century \"Shahnameh\", the Persian poet Ferdowsi credits Burzoe with the invention of the tables game \"nard\" in the 6th century."}
{"sequence": "He describes an encounter between Burzoe and a Raja visiting from India."}
{"sequence": "The Raja introduces the game of chess, and Burzoe demonstrates \"nard\", played with dice made from ivory and teak."}
{"sequence": "Today, \"Nard\" is the name for the Persian version of backgammon, which has different initial positions and objectives."}
{"sequence": "H. J. R. Murray details many versions of backgammon; modern \"Nard\" is noted there as being the same as backgammon and maybe dating back to 300–500 AD in the Babylonian Talmud, although others believe the Talmud references the Greek race game \"Kubeia\"."}
{"sequence": "The history of backgammon can be traced back nearly 5,000 years to its origins in Mesopotamia (modern-day Iraq)."}
{"sequence": "The world's oldest set of dice (made from human bone) were discovered in that part of the world."}
{"sequence": "Modern Iraqis continue to enjoy playing the game."}
{"sequence": "The Royal Game of Ur, originating in ancient Mesopotamia before 2600 BC, may also be an ancestor of modern-day table games like backgammon."}
{"sequence": "It used tetrahedral dice."}
{"sequence": "In the modern Middle East, backgammon is a common feature of coffeehouses."}
{"sequence": "Race board games involving dice have a long history in Iraq, including the Royal Game of Ur in Babylon."}
{"sequence": "Today the game is commonly played in Iraq, Lebanon, Egypt, Syria, Jordan, and other Arab countries."}
{"sequence": "Shesh\" also means 'six' in Persian and Kurdish, and five is likely to be closely related to \"penj\", meaning 'five'."}
{"sequence": "Shesh Besh is commonly used to refer to when a player scores a 5 and 6 at the same time on dice."}
{"sequence": "There are two games of \"nardi\" commonly played: Short \"nardi\": Set-up and rules are the same as backgammon."}
{"sequence": "Long \"nardi\": A game that starts with all fifteen checkers placed in one line on the 24-point and on the 11-point."}
{"sequence": "The two players move their checkers in opposing directions, from the 24-point towards the 1-point, or home board."}
{"sequence": "In long \"nardi\", one checker by itself can block a point."}
{"sequence": "There is no hitting in long \"nardi\"."}
{"sequence": "The objective of the game is bearing all checkers off the board, and there is no doubling cube."}
{"sequence": "\"Tάβλη (tavli)\" meaning 'table' or 'board' in Byzantine Greek, is the oldest game with rules known to be nearly identical to backgammon."}
{"sequence": "It is described in an epigram of Byzantine Emperor Zeno (AD 476–491)."}
{"sequence": "The board was the same, with 24 points, 12 on each side."}
{"sequence": "Like today, each player had 15 checkers and used cubical dice with sides numbered one to six."}
{"sequence": "The object of the game, to be the first to bear off all of one's checkers, was also the same."}
{"sequence": "Hitting a blot, reentering a piece from the bar, and bearing off all followed the modern rules."}
{"sequence": "The only differences from modern backgammon were the use of an extra die (three rather than two) and the starting of all pieces off the board (with them entering in the same way that pieces on the bar enter in modern backgammon)."}
{"sequence": "The name is still used for backgammon in Greece, where it is frequently played in town plateias and cafes."}
{"sequence": "The epigram of Zeno describes a particularly bad dice roll the emperor had for his given position."}
{"sequence": "Zeno, who was white, had a stack of seven checkers, three stacks of two checkers and two \"blots\", checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker."}
{"sequence": "Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6."}
{"sequence": "As in backgammon, Zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opponent (black) pieces."}
{"sequence": "The white and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, exposing them and ruining the game for Zeno."}
{"sequence": "The of Zeno's time is believed to be a direct descendant of the earlier Roman \"Ludus duodecim scriptorum\" ('Game of twelve lines') with the board's middle row of points removed, and only the two outer rows remaining."}
{"sequence": "used a board with three rows of 12 points each, with the 15 checkers being moved in opposing directions by the two players across three rows according to the roll of the three cubical dice."}
{"sequence": "Little specific text about the gameplay of has survived; it may have been related to the older Ancient Greek dice game \"Kubeia\"."}
{"sequence": "The earliest known mention of the game is in Ovid's \"Ars Amatoria\" ('The Art of Love'), written between 1 BC and 8 AD."}
{"sequence": "In Roman times, this game was also known as \"alea\", and a likely apocryphal Latin story linked this name, and the game, to a Trojan soldier named Alea."}
{"sequence": "Race board games involving dice have existed for millennia in the Near East and eastern Mediterranean, including the game senet of Ancient Egypt. \""}
{"sequence": "Senet\" was excavated, along with illustrations, from Egyptian royal tombs dating to 3500 BC."}
{"sequence": "Though using a board that is quite different from backgammon, it may be a predecessor."}
{"sequence": "The usual Tavla rules are same as in the neighboring Arab countries and Greece, as established over a millennium ago, but there are also many quite different variants."}
{"sequence": "The other variant, ('girls' tavla'), is a game that depends only on the dice and involves no strategy."}
{"sequence": "Another variant, (meaning 'soldiers' tavla'), has the pieces thrown on the board randomly."}
{"sequence": "Players try to flip their pieces over the opponents' pieces to beat them."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon is popular among Greeks."}
{"sequence": "It is a game in which Greeks usually tease their opponent and create a lively atmosphere."}
{"sequence": "A game, almost identical to backgammon, called Tavli (Byzantine Greek: ) is described in an epigram of the Byzantine Emperor Zeno (AD 476–481)."}
{"sequence": "There are four games of Tavli commonly played: Portes: Set-up and rules the same as backgammon, except that backgammons count as gammons (2 points) and there is no doubling cube."}
{"sequence": "Plakoto: A game where one checker can trap another checker on the same point."}
{"sequence": "Fevga: A game where one checker by itself can block a point."}
{"sequence": "Asodio: Also known as Acey-deucey, where all checkers are off the board, and players enter by rolling either doubles or acey-deucey."}
{"sequence": "These games are played one after another, in matches of three, five, or seven points."}
{"sequence": "Before starting a match, each player rolls 1 die, and the player with the highest roll picks up both dice and re-rolls (i.e. it is possible to roll doubles for the opening move)."}
{"sequence": "Players use the same pair of dice in turns."}
{"sequence": "After the first game, the winner of the previous game starts first."}
{"sequence": "Each game counts as 1 point, if the opponent has borne off at least 1 stone, otherwise 2 points (gammon/backgammon)."}
{"sequence": "There is no doubling cube."}
{"sequence": "Over time it was replaced by other games such as \"xiangqi\" (Chinese chess)."}
{"sequence": "In Japan, \"ban-sugoroku\" is thought to have been brought from China in the 6th century, and is mentioned in Genji monogatari."}
{"sequence": "As a gambling game, it was made illegal several times."}
{"sequence": "In the early Edo era, a new and fast gambling game called \"Chō-han\" appeared and \"sugoroku\" quickly dwindled."}
{"sequence": "By the 13th century, the board game Go, originally played only by the aristocracy, had become popular among the general public."}
{"sequence": "The ('Games of Tables'), predecessors of modern backgammon, first appeared in France during the 11th century and became a favorite pastime of gamblers."}
{"sequence": "In 1254, Louis IX issued a decree prohibiting his court officials and subjects from playing."}
{"sequence": "Tables games were played in Germany in the 12th century, and had reached Iceland by the 13th century."}
{"sequence": "In Spain, the Alfonso X manuscript \"Libro de los juegos\", completed in 1283, describes rules for a number of dice and table games in addition to its extensive discussion of chess."}
{"sequence": "By the 17th century, table games had spread to Sweden."}
{"sequence": "A wooden board and checkers were recovered from the wreck of the \"Vasa\" among the belongings of the ship's officers."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon appears widely in paintings of this period, mainly those of Dutch and German painters, such as Van Ostade, Jan Steen, Hieronymus Bosch, and Bruegel."}
{"sequence": "Some surviving artworks are \"Cardsharps\" by Caravaggio (the backgammon board is in the lower left) and \"The Triumph of Death\" by Pieter Bruegel the Elder (the backgammon board is in the lower right)."}
{"sequence": "Others include \"Hell\" (Bosch) and by Jan Steen."}
{"sequence": "In the 16th century, Elizabethan laws and church regulations prohibited playing tables, but by the 18th century, backgammon was popular among the English clergy."}
{"sequence": "Edmond Hoyle published \"A Short Treatise on the Game of Back-Gammon\" in 1753; this described rules and strategy for the game and was bound together with a similar text on whist."}
{"sequence": "The earliest use documented by the Oxford English Dictionary was in 1650."}
{"sequence": "The most recent major development in backgammon was the addition of the doubling cube."}
{"sequence": "It was first introduced in the 1920s in New York City among members of gaming clubs in the Lower East Side."}
{"sequence": "The cube required players not only to select the best move in a given position, but also to estimate the probability of winning from that position, transforming backgammon into the expected value-driven game played in the 20th and 21st centuries."}
{"sequence": "The popularity of backgammon surged in the mid-1960s, in part due to the charisma of Prince Alexis Obolensky who became known as \"The Father of Modern Backgammon\". \""}
{"sequence": "Obe\", as he was called by friends, co-founded the International Backgammon Association, which published a set of official rules."}
{"sequence": "He also established the World Backgammon Club of Manhattan, devised a backgammon tournament system in 1963, then organized the first major international backgammon tournament in March 1964, which attracted royalty, celebrities and the press."}
{"sequence": "The game became a huge fad and was played on college campuses, in discothèques and at country clubs; stockbrokers and bankers began playing at conservative men's clubs."}
{"sequence": "People young and old all across the country dusted off their boards and checkers."}
{"sequence": "Cigarette, liquor and car companies began to sponsor tournaments, and Hugh Hefner held backgammon parties at the Playboy Mansion."}
{"sequence": "Backgammon clubs were formed and tournaments were held, resulting in a World Championship promoted in Las Vegas in 1967."}
{"sequence": "Most recently, the United States Backgammon Federation (USBGF) was organized in 2009 to repopularize the game in the United States."}
{"sequence": "Board and committee members include many of the top players, tournament directors and writers in the worldwide backgammon community."}
{"sequence": "The USBGF has recently created a Standards of Ethical Practice to address issues on which tournament rules fail to touch."}
{"sequence": "Book of Ezra The Book of Ezra is a book of the Hebrew Bible; which formerly included the Book of Nehemiah in a single book, commonly distinguished in scholarship as Ezra–Nehemiah."}
{"sequence": "The two became separated with the first printed rabbinic bibles of the early 16th century, following late medieval Latin Christian tradition."}
{"sequence": "Composed in Hebrew and Aramaic, its subject is the Return to Zion following the close of the Babylonian captivity, and it is divided into two parts, the first telling the story of the first return of exiles in the first year of Cyrus the Great (538 BC) and the completion and dedication of the new Temple in Jerusalem in the sixth year of Darius I (515 BC), the second telling of the subsequent mission of Ezra to Jerusalem and his struggle to purify the Jews from marriage with non-Jews."}
{"sequence": "Together with the Book of Nehemiah, it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible."}
{"sequence": "Ezra is written to fit a schematic pattern in which the God of Israel inspires a king of Persia to commission a leader from the Jewish community to carry out a mission; three successive leaders carry out three such missions, the first rebuilding the Temple, the second purifying the Jewish community, and the third sealing the holy city itself behind a wall. ("}
{"sequence": "This last mission, that of Nehemiah, is not part of the Book of Ezra.)"}
{"sequence": "The theological program of the book explains the many problems its chronological structure presents."}
{"sequence": "It probably appeared in its earliest version around 399 BC, and continued to be revised and edited for several centuries before being accepted as scriptural in the early Christian era."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Ezra consists of ten chapters: chapters 1–6, covering the period from the Cyrus the Great to the dedication of the Second Temple, are told in the third person; chapters 7–10, dealing with the mission of Ezra, are told largely in the first person."}
{"sequence": "The book contains several documents presented as historical inclusions, written in Aramaic while the surrounding text is in Hebrew (1:2–4, 4:8–16, 4:17–22, 5:7–17, 6:3–5, 6:6–12, 7:12–26) In the early 6th century BC, the Kingdom of Judah rebelled against the Neo-Babylonian Empire and was destroyed."}
{"sequence": "As a result, the royal court, the priests, the prophets and scribes were taken into captivity in the city of Babylon."}
{"sequence": "There a profound intellectual revolution took place, the exiles blaming their fate on disobedience to their God and looking forward to a future when he would allow a purified people to return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem."}
{"sequence": "The same period saw the rapid rise of Persia, previously an unimportant kingdom in present-day southern Iran, to a position of great power, and in 539 BC Cyrus II, the Persian ruler, conquered Babylon."}
{"sequence": "It is difficult to describe the parties and politics of Judea in this period because of the lack of historical sources, but there seem to have been three important groups involved: the returnees from the exile who claimed the reconstruction with the support of Cyrus II; \"the adversaries of Judah and Benjamin\"; and a third group, \"people of the land\", who seem to be local opposition against the returnees building the Temple in Jerusalem."}
{"sequence": "The following table is a guide to major events in the region during the period covered by the Book of Ezra: The single Hebrew book Ezra–Nehemiah, with title \"Ezra\", was translated into Greek around the middle of the 2nd century BC."}
{"sequence": "The Septuagint calls Esdras B to Ezra–Nehemiah and Esdras A to 1 Esdras respectively; and this usage is noted by the early Christian scholar Origen, who remarked that the Hebrew 'book of Ezra' might then be considered a 'double' book."}
{"sequence": "Jerome, writing in the early 5th century, noted that this duplication had since been adopted by Greek and Latin Christians."}
{"sequence": "Jerome himself rejected the duplication in his Vulgate translation of the Bible into Latin from the Hebrew; and consequently all early Vulgate manuscripts present Ezra-Nehemiah as a single book."}
{"sequence": "However, from the 9th century onwards, Latin bibles are found that for the first time separate the Ezra and Nehemiah sections of Ezra-Nehemiah as two distinct books, then called the first and second books of Ezra; and this becomes standard in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century."}
{"sequence": "It was not until 1516/17, in the first printed Rabbinic Bible of Daniel Bomberg that the separation was introduced generally in Hebrew Bibles."}
{"sequence": "1 Esdras, also known as \"Esdras α\", is an alternate Greek-language version of Ezra."}
{"sequence": "This text has one additional section, the 'Tale of the Three Guardsmen' in the middle of Ezra 4."}
{"sequence": "1 Esdras (3 Esdras in the Vulgate) was considered apocryphal by Jerome."}
{"sequence": "Koresh of Ezra 1:1 is called \"king of Persia\", which title was introduced not by Cyrus the Great but by his grandson and probable namesake Xerxes (486–465 BC)."}
{"sequence": "Scholars are divided over the chronological sequence of the activities of Ezra and Nehemiah."}
{"sequence": "Ezra 7:8 says that Ezra arrived in Jerusalem in the seventh year of king Artaxerxes, while Nehemiah 2:1–9 has Nehemiah arriving in Artaxerxes' twentieth year."}
{"sequence": "If this was Artaxerxes I (465–424 BC), then Ezra arrived in 458 and Nehemiah in 445 BC."}
{"sequence": "Nehemiah 8–9, in which the two (possibly by editorial error) appear together, supports this scenario."}
{"sequence": "The contents of Ezra–Nehemiah are structured in a theological rather than chronological order: \"The Temple must come first, then the purifying of the community, then the building of the outer walls of the city, and so finally all could reach a grand climax in the reading of the law.\""}
{"sequence": "The narrative follows a repeating pattern in which the God of Israel \"stirs up\" the king of Persia to commission a Jewish leader (Zerubbabel, Ezra, Nehemiah) to undertake a mission; the leader completes his mission in the face of opposition; and success is marked by a great assembly."}
{"sequence": "The tasks of the three leaders are progressive: first the Temple is restored (Zerubabbel), then the community of Israel (Ezra), and finally the walls which will separate the purified community and Temple from the outside world (Nehemiah)."}
{"sequence": "The pattern is completed with a final coda in which Nehemiah restores the belief of Yahweh."}
{"sequence": "This concern with a schematic pattern-making, rather than with history in the modern sense of a factual account of events in the order in which they occurred, explains the origin of the many problems which surround both Ezra and Nehemiah as historical sources."}
{"sequence": "Twentieth-century views on the composition of Ezra revolved around whether the author was Ezra himself (and who may have also authored the Books of Chronicles) or was another author or authors (who also wrote the Chronicles)."}
{"sequence": "More recently it has been increasingly recognised that Ezra, Nehemiah and Chronicles all have extremely complex histories stretching over many stages of editing, and most scholars now are cautious of assuming a unified composition with a single theology and point of view."}
{"sequence": "As an indication of the many layers of editing which Ezra has undergone, one recent study finds that Ezra 1–6 and Ezra 9–10 were originally separate documents, that they were spliced together at a later stage by the authors of Ezra 7–8, and that all have undergone extensive later editing."}
{"sequence": "Seven purported Persian decrees of kings or letters to and from high officials are quoted in Ezra."}
{"sequence": "Their authenticity has been contentious; while some scholars accept them in their current form, most accept only part of them as genuine, while still others reject them entirely."}
{"sequence": "L.L. Grabbe surveys six tests against which the documents can be measured (comparative known Persian material, linguistic details, contents, presence of Jewish theology, the Persian attitude to local religions, and Persian letter-writing formulas) and concludes that all the documents are late post-Persian works and probable forgeries, but that some features suggest a genuine Persian correspondence behind some of them."}
{"sequence": "Book of Daniel The Book of Daniel is a 2nd-century BCE biblical apocalypse with an ostensible 6th century setting, combining a prophecy of history with an eschatology (a portrayal of end times) both cosmic in scope and political in focus."}
{"sequence": "It gives \"an account of the activities and visions of Daniel, a noble Jew exiled at Babylon\", and its message is that just as the God of Israel saves Daniel from his enemies, so he would save all Israel in their present oppression."}
{"sequence": "The Hebrew Bible includes the Book of Daniel in the \"Ketuvim\" (writings), while Christian Bibles group the work with the Major Prophets."}
{"sequence": "It divides into two parts, a set of six court tales in chapters 1–6, written mostly in Aramaic, and four apocalyptic visions in chapters 7–12, written mostly in Hebrew; the deuterocanon contains three additional stories, the Song of the Three Holy Children, Susanna, and Bel and the Dragon."}
{"sequence": "The book's influence has resonated through later ages, from the community of the Dead Sea Scrolls and the authors of the gospels and of Revelation, to various movements from the 2nd century to the Protestant Reformation and modern millennialist movements—on which it continues to have a profound influence."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Daniel is divided between the court tales of chapters 1–6 and the apocalyptic visions of 7–12, and between the Hebrew of chapters 1 and 8–12 and the Aramaic of chapters 2–7."}
{"sequence": "The division is reinforced by the chiastic arrangement of the Aramaic chapters (see below), and by a chronological progression in chapters 1–6 from Babylonian to Median rule, and from Babylonian to Persian rule in chapters 7–12."}
{"sequence": "Various suggestions have been made by scholars to explain the fact that the genre division does not coincide with the other two, but it appears that the language division and concentric structure of chapters 2–6 are artificial literary devices designed to bind the two halves of the book together."}
{"sequence": "The following outline is provided by Collins in his commentary on Daniel: PART I: Tales (chapters 1:1–6:29) PART II: Visions (chapters 7:1–12:13) There is a recognised chiasm (a concentric literary structure in which the main point of a passage is placed in the centre and framed by parallel elements on either side in \"ABBA\" fashion) in the chapter arrangement of the Aramaic section."}
{"sequence": "The following is taken from Paul Redditt's \"Introduction to the Prophets\": In the third year of King Jehoiakim, God allows Jerusalem to fall into the power of Nebuchadnezzar II, king of Babylon."}
{"sequence": "Young Israelites of noble and royal family, \"without physical defect, and handsome,\" versed in wisdom and competent to serve in the palace of the king, are taken to Babylon to be taught the literature and language of that nation."}
{"sequence": "Among them are Daniel and his three companions, who refuse to touch the royal food and wine."}
{"sequence": "Their overseer fears for his life in case the health of his charges deteriorates, but Daniel suggests a trial and the four emerge healthier than their counterparts from ten days of nothing but vegetables and water."}
{"sequence": "They are allowed to continue to refrain from eating the king's food, and to Daniel God gives insight into visions and dreams."}
{"sequence": "When their training is done Nebuchadnezzar finds them 'ten times better' than all the wise men in his service and therefore keeps them at his court, where Daniel continues until the first year of King Cyrus."}
{"sequence": "In the second year of his reign Nebuchadnezzar has a dream."}
{"sequence": "When he wakes up, he realizes that the dream has some important message, so he consults his wise men."}
{"sequence": "Wary of their potential to fabricate an explanation, the king refuses to tell the wise men what he saw in his dream."}
{"sequence": "Rather, he demands that his wise men tell him what the content of the dream was, and then interpret it."}
{"sequence": "When the wise men protest that this is beyond the power of any man, he sentences all, including Daniel and his friends, to death."}
{"sequence": "Daniel receives an explanatory vision from God: Nebuchadnezzar had seen an enormous statue with a head of gold, breast and arms of silver, belly and thighs of bronze, legs of iron, and feet of mixed iron and clay, then saw the statue destroyed by a rock that turned into a mountain filling the whole earth."}
{"sequence": "Daniel explains the dream to the king: the statue symbolized four successive kingdoms, starting with Nebuchadnezzar, all of which would be crushed by God's kingdom, which would endure forever."}
{"sequence": "Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges the supremacy of Daniel's god, raises Daniel over all his wise men, and places Daniel and his companions over the province of Babylon."}
{"sequence": "Daniel's companions Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego refuse to bow to King Nebuchadnezzar's golden statue and are thrown into a fiery furnace."}
{"sequence": "Nebuchadnezzar is astonished to see a fourth figure in the furnace with the three, one \"with the appearance like a son of the gods.\""}
{"sequence": "So the king called the three to come out of the fire, and blessed the God of Israel, and decreed that any who blasphemed against him should be torn limb from limb."}
{"sequence": "Nebuchadnezzar recounts a dream of a huge tree that is suddenly cut down at the command of a heavenly messenger."}
{"sequence": "Daniel is summoned and interprets the dream."}
{"sequence": "The tree is Nebuchadnezzar himself, who for seven years will lose his mind and live like a wild beast."}
{"sequence": "All of this comes to pass until, at the end of the specified time, Nebuchadnezzar acknowledges that \"heaven rules\" and his kingdom and sanity are restored."}
{"sequence": "Belshazzar and his nobles blasphemously drink from sacred Jewish temple vessels, offering praise to inanimate gods, until a hand mysteriously appears and writes upon the wall."}
{"sequence": "The horrified king summons Daniel, who upbraids him for his lack of humility before God and interprets the message: Belshazzar's kingdom will be given to the Medes and Persians."}
{"sequence": "Belshazzar rewards Daniel and raises him to be third in the kingdom, and that very night Belshazzar is slain and Darius the Mede takes the kingdom."}
{"sequence": "Darius elevates Daniel to high office, exciting the jealousy of other officials."}
{"sequence": "Knowing of Daniel's devotion to his God, his enemies trick the king into issuing an edict forbidding worship of any other god or man for a 30-day period."}
{"sequence": "Daniel continues to pray three times a day to God towards Jerusalem; he is accused and King Darius, forced by his own decree, throws Daniel into the lions' den."}
{"sequence": "But God shuts up the mouths of the lions, and the next morning Darius rejoices to find him unharmed."}
{"sequence": "The king casts Daniel's accusers into the lions' pit together with their wives and children to be instantly devoured, while he himself acknowledges Daniel's God as he whose kingdom shall never be destroyed."}
{"sequence": "In the first year of Belshazzar Daniel has a dream of four monstrous beasts arising from the sea."}
{"sequence": "The fourth, a beast with ten horns, devours the whole earth, treading it down and crushing it, and a further small horn appears and uproots three of the earlier horns."}
{"sequence": "The Ancient of Days judges and destroys the beast, and \"one like a son of man\" is given everlasting kingship over the entire world."}
{"sequence": "A divine being explains that the four beasts represent four kings, but that \"the holy ones of the Most High\" would receive the everlasting kingdom."}
{"sequence": "The fourth beast would be a fourth kingdom with ten kings, and another king who would pull down three kings and make war on the \"holy ones\" for \"a time, two times and a half,\" after which the heavenly judgement will be made against him and the \"holy ones\" will receive the everlasting kingdom."}
{"sequence": "In the third year of Belshazzar Daniel has vision of a ram and goat."}
{"sequence": "The ram has two mighty horns, one longer than the other, and it charges west, north and south, overpowering all other beasts."}
{"sequence": "A goat with a single horn appears from the west and destroys the ram."}
{"sequence": "The goat becomes very powerful until the horn breaks off and is replaced by four lesser horns."}
{"sequence": "A small horn that grows very large, it stops the daily temple sacrifices and desecrates the sanctuary for two thousand three hundred \"evening and mornings\" (which could be either 1,150 or 2,300 days) until the temple is cleansed."}
{"sequence": "The angel Gabriel informs him that the ram represents the Medes and Persians, the goat is Greece, and the \"little horn\" is a wicked king."}
{"sequence": "In the first year of Darius the Mede, Daniel meditates on the word of Jeremiah that the desolation of Jerusalem would last seventy years; he confesses the sin of Israel and pleads for God to restore Israel and the \"desolated sanctuary\" of the Temple."}
{"sequence": "The angel Gabriel explains that the seventy years stand for seventy \"weeks\" of years (490 years), during which the Temple will first be restored, then later defiled by a \"prince who is to come,\" \"until the decreed end is poured out.\""}
{"sequence": "Daniel 10: In the third year of Cyrus Daniel sees in his vision an angel (called \"a man\", but clearly a supernatural being) who explains that he is in the midst of a war with the \"prince of Persia\", assisted only by Michael, \"your prince.\""}
{"sequence": "The \"prince of Greece\" will shortly come, but first he will reveal what will happen to Daniel's people."}
{"sequence": "Daniel 11: A future king of Persia will make war on the king of Greece, a \"mighty king\" will arise and wield power until his empire is broken up and given to others, and finally the king of the south (identified in verse 8 as Egypt) will go to war with the \"king of the north.\""}
{"sequence": "After many battles (described in great detail) a \"contemptible person\" will become king of the north; this king will invade the south two times, the first time with success, but on his second he will be stopped by \"ships of Kittim.\""}
{"sequence": "He will turn back to his own country, and on the way his soldiers will desecrate the Temple, abolish the daily sacrifice, and set up the abomination of desolation."}
{"sequence": "He will defeat and subjugate Libya and Egypt, but \"reports from the east and north will alarm him,\" and he will meet his end \"between the sea and the holy mountain.\""}
{"sequence": "Daniel 12: At this time Michael will come."}
{"sequence": "It will be a time of great distress, but all those whose names are written will be delivered. \""}
{"sequence": "Multitudes who sleep in the dust of the earth will awake, some to everlasting life, others to shame and everlasting contempt; those who are wise will shine like the brightness of the heavens, and those who lead many to righteousness, like the stars for ever and ever.\""}
{"sequence": "In the final verses the remaining time to the end is revealed: \"a time, times and half a time\" (three years and a half)."}
{"sequence": "Daniel fails to understand and asks again what will happen, and is told: \"From the time that the daily sacrifice is abolished and the abomination that causes desolation is set up, there will be 1,290 days."}
{"sequence": "Blessed is the one who waits for and reaches the end of the 1,335 days.\""}
{"sequence": "The Greek text of Daniel is considerably longer than the Hebrew, due to three additional stories: they remain in Catholic and Orthodox Bibles but were rejected by the Protestant movement in the 16th century on the basis that they were absent from Jewish Bibles."}
{"sequence": "The visions of chapters 7–12 reflect the crisis which took place in Judea in 167–164 BCE when Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Greek king of the Seleucid Empire, threatened to destroy traditional Jewish worship in Jerusalem."}
{"sequence": "When Antiochus came to the throne in 175 BCE the Jews were largely pro-Seleucid."}
{"sequence": "The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest."}
{"sequence": "Jason also asked—or more accurately, paid—to be allowed to make Jerusalem a \"polis\", or Greek city."}
{"sequence": "This meant, among other things, that city government would be in the hands of the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a valuable commodity, to be purchased from Jason."}
{"sequence": "None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests."}
{"sequence": "Three years later Jason was deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest."}
{"sequence": "Antiochus invaded Egypt twice, in 169 BCE with success, but on the second incursion, in late 168 BCE, he was forced to withdraw by the Romans."}
{"sequence": "Jason, hearing a rumour that Antiochus was dead, attacked Menelaus to take back the High Priesthood."}
{"sequence": "Antiochus drove Jason out of Jerusalem, plundered the Temple, and introduced measures to pacify his Egyptian border by imposing complete Hellenisation: the Jewish Book of the Law was prohibited and on 15 December 167 BCE an \"abomination of desolation\", probably a Greek altar, was introduced into the Temple."}
{"sequence": "With the Jewish religion now clearly under threat a resistance movement sprang up, led by the Maccabee brothers, and over the next three years it won sufficient victories over Antiochus to take back and purify the Temple."}
{"sequence": "The crisis which the author of Daniel addresses is the defilement of the altar in Jerusalem in 167 BCE (first introduced in chapter 8:11): the daily offering which used to take place twice a day, at morning and evening, stopped, and the phrase \"evenings and mornings\" recurs through the following chapters as a reminder of the missed sacrifices."}
{"sequence": "But whereas the events leading up to the sacking of the Temple in 167 BCE and the immediate aftermath are remarkably accurate, the predicted war between the Syrians and the Egyptians (11:40–43) never took place, and the prophecy that Antiochus would die in Palestine (11:44–45) was inaccurate (he died in Persia)."}
{"sequence": "The obvious conclusion is that the account must have been completed near the end of the reign of Antiochus but before his death in December 164 BCE, or at least before news of it reached Jerusalem, and the consensus of modern scholarship is accordingly that the book dates to the period 167–163 BCE."}
{"sequence": "It is generally accepted that Daniel originated as a collection of Aramaic court tales later expanded by the Hebrew revelations."}
{"sequence": "The court tales may have originally circulated independently, but the edited collection was probably composed in the third or early second century BCE."}
{"sequence": "Chapter 1 was composed (in Aramaic) at this time as a brief introduction of to provide historical context, introduce the characters of the tales, and explain how Daniel and his friends came to Babylon."}
{"sequence": "The visions of chapters 7–12 were added and chapter 1 translated into Hebrew at the third stage when the final book was being drawn together."}
{"sequence": "Daniel is a product of \"Wisdom\" circles, but the type of wisdom is (the discovery of heavenly secrets from earthly signs) rather than the wisdom of learning—the main source of wisdom in Daniel is God's revelation."}
{"sequence": "It is one of a large number of Jewish apocalypses, all of them pseudonymous."}
{"sequence": "The stories of the first half are legendary in origin, and the visions of the second the product of anonymous authors in the Maccabean period (2nd century BCE)."}
{"sequence": "Chapters 1–6 are in the voice of an anonymous narrator, except for chapter 4 which is in the form of a letter from king Nebuchadnezzar; the second half (chapters 7–12) is presented by Daniel himself, introduced by the anonymous narrator in chapters 7 and 10."}
{"sequence": "The author/editor was probably an educated Jew, knowledgeable in Greek learning, and of high standing in his own community."}
{"sequence": "It is possible that the name of Daniel was chosen for the hero of the book because of his reputation as a wise seer in Hebrew tradition."}
{"sequence": "Ezekiel, who lived during the Babylonian exile, mentioned him in association with Noah and Job (Ezekiel 14:14) as a figure of legendary wisdom (28:3), and a hero named Daniel (more accurately Dan'el, but the spelling is close enough for the two to be regarded as identical) features in a late 2nd millennium myth from Ugarit. \""}
{"sequence": "The legendary Daniel, known from long ago but still remembered as an exemplary character ... serves as the principal human 'hero' in the biblical book that now bears his name\"; Daniel is the wise and righteous intermediary who is able to interpret dreams and thus convey the will of God to humans, the recipient of visions from on high that are interpreted to him by heavenly intermediaries."}
{"sequence": "The prophecies of Daniel are accurate down to the career of Antiochus IV Epiphanes, king of Syria and oppressor of the Jews, but not in its prediction of his death: the author seems to know about Antiochus' two campaigns in Egypt (169 and 167 BCE), the desecration of the Temple (the \"abomination of desolation\"), and the fortification of the Akra (a fortress built inside Jerusalem), but he seems to know nothing about the reconstruction of the Temple or about the actual circumstances of Antiochus' death in late 164 BCE."}
{"sequence": "Chapters 10–12 must therefore have been written between 167 and 164 BCE."}
{"sequence": "There is no evidence of a significant time lapse between those chapters and chapters 8 and 9, and chapter 7 may have been written just a few months earlier again."}
{"sequence": "Further evidence of the book's date is in the fact that Daniel is excluded from the Hebrew Bible's canon of the prophets, which was closed around 200 BCE, and the Wisdom of Sirach, a work dating from around 180 BCE, draws on almost every book of the Old Testament except Daniel, leading scholars to suppose that its author was unaware of it."}
{"sequence": "Daniel is, however, quoted in a section of the Sibylline Oracles commonly dated to the middle of the 2nd century BCE, and was popular at Qumran at much the same time, suggesting that it was known from the middle of that century."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Daniel is preserved in the 12-chapter Masoretic Text and in two longer Greek versions, the original Septuagint version, c. 100 BCE, and the later Theodotion version from c. 2nd century CE."}
{"sequence": "Both Greek texts contain three additions to Daniel: The Prayer of Azariah and Song of the Three Holy Children; the story of Susannah and the Elders; and the story of Bel and the Dragon."}
{"sequence": "Theodotion is much closer to the Masoretic Text and became so popular that it replaced the original Septuagint version in all but two manuscripts of the Septuagint itself."}
{"sequence": "The Greek additions were apparently never part of the Hebrew text."}
{"sequence": "Eight copies of the Book of Daniel, all incomplete, have been found at Qumran, two in Cave 1, five in Cave 4, and one in Cave 6."}
{"sequence": "Between them, they preserve text from eleven of Daniel's twelve chapters, and the twelfth is quoted in the Florilegium (a compilation scroll) 4Q174, showing that the book at Qumran did not lack this conclusion."}
{"sequence": "All eight manuscripts were copied between 125 BCE (4QDan) and about 50 CE (4QDan), showing that Daniel was being read at Qumran only about 40 years after its composition."}
{"sequence": "All appear to preserve the 12-chapter Masoretic version rather than the longer Greek text."}
{"sequence": "None reveal any major disagreements against the Masoretic, and the four scrolls that preserve the relevant sections (1QDan, 4QDan, 4QDan, and 4QDan) all follow the bilingual nature of Daniel where the book opens in Hebrew, switches to Aramaic at 2:4b, then reverts to Hebrew at 8:1."}
{"sequence": "\"(This section deals with modern scholarly reconstructions of the meaning of Daniel to its original authors and audience)\" The Book of Daniel is an apocalypse, a literary genre in which a heavenly reality is revealed to a human recipient; such works are characterized by visions, symbolism, an other-worldly mediator, an emphasis on cosmic events, angels and demons, and pseudonymity (false authorship)."}
{"sequence": "The production of apocalypses occurred commonly from 300 BCE to 100 CE, not only among Jews and Christians, but also among Greeks, Romans, Persians and Egyptians, and Daniel is a representative apocalyptic seer, the recipient of divine revelation: he has learned the wisdom of the Babylonian magicians and surpassed them, because his God is the true source of knowledge; he is one of the \"maskilim\" (משכלים), the wise ones, who have the task of teaching righteousness and whose number may be considered to include the authors of the book itself."}
{"sequence": "The book is also an eschatology, as the divine revelation concerns the end of the present age, a predicted moment in which God will intervene in history to usher in the final kingdom."}
{"sequence": "It gives no real details of the end-time, but it seems that God's kingdom will be on this earth, that it will be governed by justice and righteousness, and that the tables will be turned on the Seleucids and those Jews who have cooperated with them."}
{"sequence": "The message of the Book of Daniel is that, just as the God of Israel saved Daniel and his friends from their enemies, so he would save all Israel in their present oppression."}
{"sequence": "The book is filled with monsters, angels, and numerology, drawn from a wide range of sources, both biblical and non-biblical, that would have had meaning in the context of 2nd-century Jewish culture, and while Christian interpreters have always viewed these as predicting events in the New Testament—\"the Son of God\", \"the Son of Man\", Christ and the Antichrist—the book's intended audience is the Jews of the 2nd century BCE."}
{"sequence": "The following explains a few of these predictions, as understood by modern biblical scholars."}
{"sequence": "The concepts of immortality and resurrection, with rewards for the righteous and punishment for the wicked, have roots much deeper than Daniel, but the first clear statement is found in the final chapter of that book: \"Many of those who sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake, some to everlasting life, and some to everlasting shame and contempt.\""}
{"sequence": "Without this belief, Christianity, in which the resurrection of Jesus plays a central role, would have disappeared, like the movements following other charismatic Jewish figures of the 1st century."}
{"sequence": "Daniel was quoted and referenced by both Jews and Christians in the 1st century CE as predicting the imminent end-time."}
{"sequence": "Moments of national and cultural crisis continually reawakened the apocalyptic spirit, through the Montanists of the 2nd/3rd centuries, persecuted for their millennialism, to the more extreme elements of the 16th-century Reformation such as the Zwickau prophets and the Münster Rebellion."}
{"sequence": "During the English Civil War, the Fifth Monarchy Men took their name and political program from Daniel 7, demanding that Oliver Cromwell allow them to form a \"government of saints\" in preparation for the coming of the Messiah; when Cromwell refused, they identified him instead as the Beast usurping the rightful place of King Jesus."}
{"sequence": "For modern popularizers, the visions and revelations of Daniel remain a guide to the future, when the Antichrist will be destroyed by Jesus Christ at the Second Coming."}
{"sequence": "The influence of Daniel has not been confined to Judaism and Christianity: In the Middle Ages Muslims created horoscopes whose authority was attributed to Daniel."}
{"sequence": "More recently the Baháʼí Faith, which originated in Persian Shi'ite Islam, justified its existence on the 1260-day prophecy of Daniel, holding that it foretold the coming of the Twelfth Imam and an age of peace and justice in the year 1844, which is the year 1260 of the Muslim era."}
{"sequence": "Daniel belongs not only to the religious tradition but also to the wider Western intellectual and artistic heritage."}
{"sequence": "It was easily the most popular of the prophetic books for the Anglo-Saxons, who nevertheless treated it not as prophecy but as a historical book, \"a repository of dramatic stories about confrontations between God and a series of emperor-figures who represent the highest reach of man\"."}
{"sequence": "In the early modern period the physicist Isaac Newton paid special attention to it, and Francis Bacon borrowed a motto from it for his work \"Novum Organum\"."}
{"sequence": "Philosophers, such as Baruch Spinoza drew on it."}
{"sequence": "In the 20th century its apocalyptic second half attracted the attention of Carl Jung."}
{"sequence": "The book has also inspired musicians, from medieval liturgical drama to the 20th century compositions of Darius Milhaud."}
{"sequence": "Artists including Michelangelo, Rembrandt and Eugène Delacroix have all drawn on its imagery."}
{"sequence": "Batman Batman is a fictional superhero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics."}
{"sequence": "The character was created by artist Bob Kane and writer Bill Finger, and first appeared in \"Detective Comics\" #27 in 1939."}
{"sequence": "Originally named the \"Bat-Man,\" the character is also referred to by such epithets as the Caped Crusader, the Dark Knight, and the World's Greatest Detective."}
{"sequence": "Batman is the secret identity of Bruce Wayne, a wealthy American playboy, philanthropist, and owner of Wayne Enterprises."}
{"sequence": "Batman originated from an incident in Bruce's childhood; after witnessing the murder of his parents Dr. Thomas Wayne and Martha Wayne, he swore vengeance against criminals, an oath tempered by a sense of justice."}
{"sequence": "Bruce trains himself physically and intellectually and crafts a bat-inspired persona to fight crime."}
{"sequence": "Batman operates in the fictional Gotham City with assistance from various supporting characters, including his butler Alfred, police commissioner Jim Gordon, and vigilante allies such as Robin."}
{"sequence": "Unlike most superheroes, Batman does not possess any strange superpowers."}
{"sequence": "He does, however, possess a genius-level intellect and is a peerless martial artist, and his vast wealth affords him an extraordinary arsenal of weaponry and equipment."}
{"sequence": "A large assortment of villains make up Batman's rogues gallery, including his nemesis, the Joker."}
{"sequence": "The character became popular soon after his introduction in 1939 and gained his own comic book title, \"Batman\", the following year."}
{"sequence": "In 1943, an adapted version of the character made its first film appearance in the film serial \"Batman\", followed six years later by a sequel serial."}
{"sequence": "As the decades went on, different interpretations of the character emerged."}
{"sequence": "The late 1960s \"Batman\" television series used a camp aesthetic, which continued to be associated with the character for years after the show ended."}
{"sequence": "Various creators worked to return the character to his dark roots in the '70s and '80s, culminating in 1986 with \"The Dark Knight Returns\" by Frank Miller."}
{"sequence": "The success of Warner Bros. Pictures' live-action \"Batman\" feature films have helped maintain the character's prominence in mainstream culture."}
{"sequence": "Batman has been licensed and featured in various adaptations, from radio to television and film, and appears in merchandise sold around the world, such as apparel, toys, and video games."}
{"sequence": "Kevin Conroy, Rino Romano, Anthony Ruivivar, Peter Weller, Bruce Greenwood, Jason O'Mara, and Will Arnett, among others, have provided the character's voice for animated adaptations."}
{"sequence": "Batman has been depicted in both film and television by Lewis Wilson, Robert Lowery, Adam West, Michael Keaton, Val Kilmer, George Clooney, Bruce Thomas, Christian Bale, Ben Affleck, David Mazouz, Iain Glen, Kevin Conroy, and Warren Christie."}
{"sequence": "Robert Pattinson will portray the character in the upcoming 2022 film, \"The Batman\"."}
{"sequence": "In early 1939, the success of Superman in \"Action Comics\" prompted editors at National Comics Publications (the future DC Comics) to request more superheroes for its titles."}
{"sequence": "In response, Bob Kane created \"the Bat-Man\"."}
{"sequence": "Collaborator Bill Finger recalled that \"Kane had an idea for a character called 'Batman,' and he'd like me to see the drawings."}
{"sequence": "I went over to Kane's, and he had drawn a character who looked very much like Superman with kind of ... reddish tights, I believe, with boots ... no gloves, no gauntlets ... with a small domino mask, swinging on a rope."}
{"sequence": "He had two stiff wings that were sticking out, looking like bat wings."}
{"sequence": "And under it was a big sign ... BATMAN\"."}
{"sequence": "The bat-wing-like cape was suggested by Bob Kane, inspired as a child by Leonardo Da Vinci's sketch of an ornithopter flying device."}
{"sequence": "Finger suggested giving the character a cowl instead of a simple domino mask, a cape instead of wings, and gloves; he also recommended removing the red sections from the original costume."}
{"sequence": "Finger said he devised the name Bruce Wayne for the character's secret identity: \"Bruce Wayne's first name came from Robert Bruce, the Scottish patriot."}
{"sequence": "Wayne, being a playboy, was a man of gentry."}
{"sequence": "I searched for a name that would suggest colonialism."}
{"sequence": "I tried Adams, Hancock ... then I thought of Mad Anthony Wayne.\""}
{"sequence": "He later said his suggestions were influenced by Lee Falk's popular \"The Phantom\", a syndicated newspaper comic-strip character with which Kane was also familiar."}
{"sequence": "Kane and Finger drew upon contemporary 1930s popular culture for inspiration regarding much of the Bat-Man's look, personality, methods, and weaponry."}
{"sequence": "Details find predecessors in pulp fiction, comic strips, newspaper headlines, and autobiographical details referring to Kane himself."}
{"sequence": "As an aristocratic hero with a double identity, Batman had predecessors in the Scarlet Pimpernel (created by Baroness Emmuska Orczy, 1903) and Zorro (created by Johnston McCulley, 1919)."}
{"sequence": "Like them, Batman performed his heroic deeds in secret, averted suspicion by playing aloof in public, and marked his work with a signature symbol."}
{"sequence": "Kane noted the influence of the films \"The Mark of Zorro\" (1920) and \"The Bat Whispers\" (1930) in the creation of the character's iconography."}
{"sequence": "Finger, drawing inspiration from pulp heroes like Doc Savage, The Shadow, Dick Tracy, and Sherlock Holmes, made the character a master sleuth."}
{"sequence": "In his 1989 autobiography, Kane detailed Finger's contributions to Batman's creation: Kane signed away ownership in the character in exchange for, among other compensation, a mandatory byline on all Batman comics."}
{"sequence": "This byline did not originally say \"Batman created by Bob Kane\"; his name was simply written on the title page of each story."}
{"sequence": "The name disappeared from the comic book in the mid-1960s, replaced by credits for each story's actual writer and artists."}
{"sequence": "In the late 1970s, when Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster began receiving a \"created by\" credit on the Superman titles, along with William Moulton Marston being given the byline for creating Wonder Woman, Batman stories began saying \"Created by Bob Kane\" in addition to the other credits."}
{"sequence": "Finger did not receive the same recognition."}
{"sequence": "While he had received credit for other DC work since the 1940s, he began, in the 1960s, to receive limited acknowledgment for his Batman writing; in the letters page of \"Batman\" #169 (February 1965) for example, editor Julius Schwartz names him as the creator of the Riddler, one of Batman's recurring villains."}
{"sequence": "However, Finger's contract left him only with his writing page rate and no byline."}
{"sequence": "Kane wrote, \"Bill was disheartened by the lack of major accomplishments in his career."}
{"sequence": "He felt that he had not used his creative potential to its fullest and that success had passed him by.\""}
{"sequence": "At the time of Finger's death in 1974, DC had not officially credited Finger as Batman co-creator."}
{"sequence": "Jerry Robinson, who also worked with Finger and Kane on the strip at this time, has criticized Kane for failing to share the credit."}
{"sequence": "This statement is fraudulent and entirely untrue.\""}
{"sequence": "Kane himself also commented on Finger's lack of credit. \""}
{"sequence": "The trouble with being a 'ghost' writer or artist is that you must remain rather anonymously without 'credit'."}
{"sequence": "However, if one wants the 'credit', then one has to cease being a 'ghost' or follower and become a leader or innovator.\""}
{"sequence": "Finger received credit as a creator of Batman for the first time in a comic in October 2015 with \"Batman and Robin Eternal\" #3 and \"Batman: Arkham Knight Genesis\" #3."}
{"sequence": "The updated acknowledgment for the character appeared as \"Batman created by Bob Kane with Bill Finger\"."}
{"sequence": "The first Batman story, \"The Case of the Chemical Syndicate\", was published in \"Detective Comics\" #27 (May 1939)."}
{"sequence": "Finger said, \"Batman was originally written in the style of the pulps\", and this influence was evident with Batman showing little remorse over killing or maiming criminals."}
{"sequence": "Batman proved a hit character, and he received his own solo title in 1940 while continuing to star in \"Detective Comics\"."}
{"sequence": "By that time, Detective Comics was the top-selling and most influential publisher in the industry; Batman and the company's other major hero, Superman, were the cornerstones of the company's success."}
{"sequence": "The two characters were featured side by side as the stars of \"World's Finest Comics\", which was originally titled \"World's Best Comics\" when it debuted in fall 1940."}
{"sequence": "Creators including Jerry Robinson and Dick Sprang also worked on the strips during this period."}
{"sequence": "Over the course of the first few Batman strips elements were added to the character and the artistic depiction of Batman evolved."}
{"sequence": "Kane noted that within six issues he drew the character's jawline more pronounced, and lengthened the ears on the costume. \""}
{"sequence": "About a year later he was almost the full figure, my mature Batman\", Kane said."}
{"sequence": "Batman's characteristic utility belt was introduced in \"Detective Comics\" #29 (July 1939), followed by the boomerang-like batarang and the first bat-themed vehicle, the Batplane, in #31 (Sept. 1939)."}
{"sequence": "The character's origin was revealed in #33 (Nov. 1939), unfolding in a two-page story that establishes the brooding persona of Batman, a character driven by the death of his parents."}
{"sequence": "Written by Finger, it depicts a young Bruce Wayne witnessing his parents' murder at the hands of a mugger."}
{"sequence": "Days later, at their grave, the child vows that \"by the spirits of my parents [I will] avenge their deaths by spending the rest of my life warring on all criminals\"."}
{"sequence": "The early, pulp-inflected portrayal of Batman started to soften in \"Detective Comics\" #38 (April 1940) with the introduction of Robin, Batman's junior counterpart."}
{"sequence": "Robin was introduced, based on Finger's suggestion, because Batman needed a \"Watson\" with whom Batman could talk."}
{"sequence": "Sales nearly doubled, despite Kane's preference for a solo Batman, and it sparked a proliferation of \"kid sidekicks\"."}
{"sequence": "The first issue of the solo spin-off series \"Batman\" was notable not only for introducing two of his most persistent enemies, the Joker and Catwoman, but for a pre-Robin inventory story, originally meant for \"Detective Comics #38\", in which Batman shoots some monstrous giants to death."}
{"sequence": "That story prompted editor Whitney Ellsworth to decree that the character could no longer kill or use a gun."}
{"sequence": "By 1942, the writers and artists behind the Batman comics had established most of the basic elements of the Batman mythos."}
{"sequence": "In the years following World War II, DC Comics \"adopted a postwar editorial direction that increasingly de-emphasized social commentary in favor of lighthearted juvenile fantasy\"."}
{"sequence": "The impact of this editorial approach was evident in \"Batman\" comics of the postwar period; removed from the \"bleak and menacing world\" of the strips of the early 1940s, Batman was instead portrayed as a respectable citizen and paternal figure that inhabited a \"bright and colorful\" environment."}
{"sequence": "Batman was one of the few superhero characters to be continuously published as interest in the genre waned during the 1950s."}
{"sequence": "In the story \"The Mightiest Team in the World\" in \"Superman\" #76 (June 1952), Batman teams up with Superman for the first time and the pair discover each other's secret identity."}
{"sequence": "Following the success of this story, \"World's Finest Comics\" was revamped so it featured stories starring both heroes together, instead of the separate Batman and Superman features that had been running before."}
{"sequence": "The team-up of the characters was \"a financial success in an era when those were few and far between\"; this series of stories ran until the book's cancellation in 1986."}
{"sequence": "Batman comics were among those criticized when the comic book industry came under scrutiny with the publication of psychologist Fredric Wertham's book \"Seduction of the Innocent\" in 1954."}
{"sequence": "Wertham's thesis was that children imitated crimes committed in comic books, and that these works corrupted the morals of the youth."}
{"sequence": "Wertham criticized Batman comics for their supposed homosexual overtones and argued that Batman and Robin were portrayed as lovers."}
{"sequence": "Wertham's criticisms raised a public outcry during the 1950s, eventually leading to the establishment of the Comics Code Authority, a code that is no longer in use by the comic book industry."}
{"sequence": "The tendency towards a \"sunnier Batman\" in the postwar years intensified after the introduction of the Comics Code."}
{"sequence": "Scholars have suggested that the characters of Batwoman (in 1956) and the pre-Barbara Gordon Bat-Girl (in 1961) were introduced in part to refute the allegation that Batman and Robin were gay, and the stories took on a campier, lighter feel."}
{"sequence": "In the late 1950s, Batman stories gradually became more science fiction-oriented, an attempt at mimicking the success of other DC characters that had dabbled in the genre."}
{"sequence": "New characters such as Batwoman, the original Bat-Girl, Ace the Bat-Hound, and Bat-Mite were introduced."}
{"sequence": "Batman's adventures often involved odd transformations or bizarre space aliens."}
{"sequence": "In 1960, Batman debuted as a member of the Justice League of America in \"The Brave and the Bold\" #28 (Feb. 1960), and went on to appear in several Justice League comic book series starting later that same year."}
{"sequence": "By 1964, sales of Batman titles had fallen drastically."}
{"sequence": "Bob Kane noted that, as a result, DC was \"planning to kill Batman off altogether\"."}
{"sequence": "In response to this, editor Julius Schwartz was assigned to the Batman titles."}
{"sequence": "He presided over drastic changes, beginning with 1964's \"Detective Comics\" #327 (May 1964), which was cover-billed as the \"New Look\"."}
{"sequence": "Schwartz introduced changes designed to make Batman more contemporary, and to return him to more detective-oriented stories."}
{"sequence": "He brought in artist Carmine Infantino to help overhaul the character."}
{"sequence": "The Batmobile was redesigned, and Batman's costume was modified to incorporate a yellow ellipse behind the bat-insignia."}
{"sequence": "The space aliens, time travel, and characters of the 1950s such as Batwoman, Ace, and Bat-Mite were retired."}
{"sequence": "Bruce Wayne's butler Alfred was killed off (though his death was quickly reversed) while a new female relative for the Wayne family, Aunt Harriet, came to live with Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson."}
{"sequence": "The debut of the \"Batman\" television series in 1966 had a profound influence on the character."}
{"sequence": "The success of the series increased sales throughout the comic book industry, and \"Batman\" reached a circulation of close to 900,000 copies."}
{"sequence": "Elements such as the character of Batgirl and the show's campy nature were introduced into the comics; the series also initiated the return of Alfred."}
{"sequence": "Although both the comics and TV show were successful for a time, the camp approach eventually wore thin and the show was canceled in 1968."}
{"sequence": "In the aftermath, the Batman comics themselves lost popularity once again."}
{"sequence": "As Julius Schwartz noted, \"When the television show was a success, I was asked to be campy, and of course when the show faded, so did the comic books.\""}
{"sequence": "Starting in 1969, writer Dennis O'Neil and artist Neal Adams made a deliberate effort to distance Batman from the campy portrayal of the 1960s TV series and to return the character to his roots as a \"grim avenger of the night\"."}
{"sequence": "O'Neil said his idea was \"simply to take it back to where it started."}
{"sequence": "I went to the DC library and read some of the early stories."}
{"sequence": "I tried to get a sense of what Kane and Finger were after.\""}
{"sequence": "O'Neil and Adams first collaborated on the story \"The Secret of the Waiting Graves\" in \"Detective Comics\" #395 (Jan. 1970)."}
{"sequence": "Few stories were true collaborations between O'Neil, Adams, Schwartz, and inker Dick Giordano, and in actuality these men were mixed and matched with various other creators during the 1970s; nevertheless the influence of their work was \"tremendous\"."}
{"sequence": "Regardless, circulation continued to drop through the 1970s and 1980s, hitting an all-time low in 1985."}
{"sequence": "Frank Miller's limited series \"The Dark Knight Returns\" (February–June 1986) returned the character to his darker roots, both in atmosphere and tone."}
{"sequence": "The comic book, which tells the story of a 55-year-old Batman coming out of retirement in a possible future, reinvigorated interest in the character. \""}
{"sequence": "The Dark Knight Returns\" was a financial success and has since become one of the medium's most noted touchstones."}
{"sequence": "The series also sparked a major resurgence in the character's popularity."}
{"sequence": "That year Dennis O'Neil took over as editor of the Batman titles and set the template for the portrayal of Batman following DC's status quo-altering miniseries \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\"."}
{"sequence": "O'Neil operated under the assumption that he was hired to revamp the character and as a result tried to instill a different tone in the books than had gone before."}
{"sequence": "The Batman comics garnered major attention in 1988 when DC Comics created a 900 number for readers to call to vote on whether Jason Todd, the second Robin, lived or died."}
{"sequence": "Jean-Paul Valley, known as Azrael, is called upon to wear the Batsuit during Bruce Wayne's convalescence."}
{"sequence": "Writers Doug Moench, Chuck Dixon, and Alan Grant worked on the Batman titles during \"Knightfall\", and would also contribute to other Batman crossovers throughout the 1990s."}
{"sequence": "At the conclusion of \"No Man's Land\", O'Neil stepped down as editor and was replaced by Bob Schreck."}
{"sequence": "Another writer who rose to prominence on the Batman comic series, was Jeph Loeb."}
{"sequence": "The 12–issue storyline has Batman and Catwoman teaming up against Batman's entire rogues gallery, including an apparently resurrected Jason Todd, while seeking to find the identity of the mysterious supervillain Hush."}
{"sequence": "While the character of Hush failed to catch on with readers, the arc was a sales success for DC."}
{"sequence": "In 2005, DC launched \"All-Star Batman and Robin\", a stand-alone comic series set outside the main DC Universe continuity."}
{"sequence": "Written by Frank Miller and drawn by Jim Lee, the series was a commercial success for DC Comics, although it was widely panned by critics for its writing and strong depictions of violence."}
{"sequence": "Starting in 2006, Grant Morrison and Paul Dini were the regular writers of \"Batman\" and \"Detective Comics\", with Morrison reincorporating controversial elements of Batman lore."}
{"sequence": "Most notably of these elements were the science fiction themed storylines of the 1950s Batman comics, which Morrison revised as hallucinations Batman suffered under the influence of various mind-bending gases and extensive sensory deprivation training."}
{"sequence": "Morrison's run climaxed with \"Batman R.I.P.\", which brought Batman up against the villainous \"Black Glove\" organization, which sought to drive Batman into madness. \""}
{"sequence": "Batman R.I.P.\" segued into \"Final Crisis\" (also written by Morrison), which saw the apparent death of Batman at the hands of Darkseid."}
{"sequence": "In June 2009, Judd Winick returned to writing \"Batman\", while Grant Morrison was given his own series, titled \"Batman and Robin\"."}
{"sequence": "Although he reclaimed the mantle of Batman, he also allowed Grayson to continue being Batman as well."}
{"sequence": "Bruce decided to take his crime-fighting cause globally, which is the central focus of \"Batman Incorporated\"."}
{"sequence": "DC Comics would later announce that Grayson would be the main character in \"Batman\", \"Detective Comics\", and \"Batman and Robin\", while Wayne would be the main character in \"Batman Incorporated\"."}
{"sequence": "In September 2011, DC Comics' entire line of superhero comic books, including its \"Batman\" franchise, were canceled and relaunched with new #1 issues as part of \"The New 52\" reboot."}

{"sequence": "While many characters have their histories significantly altered to attract new readers, Batman's history remains mostly intact. \""}
{"sequence": "Batman Incorporated\" was relaunched in 2012–2013 to complete the \"Leviathan\" storyline."}
{"sequence": "With the beginning of \"The New 52\", Scott Snyder was the writer of the \"Batman\" title."}
{"sequence": "His first major story arc was \"Night of the Owls\", where Batman confronts the Court of Owls, a secret society that has controlled Gotham for centuries."}
{"sequence": "The second story arc was \"Death of the Family\", where the Joker returns to Gotham and simultaneously attacks each member of the Batman family."}
{"sequence": "It followed \"Batman\" #0, published in June 2012, which explored the character's early years."}

{"sequence": "He resides on the outskirts of Gotham City in his personal residence, Wayne Manor."}
{"sequence": "Wayne averts suspicion by acting the part of a superficial playboy idly living off his family's fortune and the profits of Wayne Enterprises, his inherited conglomerate."}
{"sequence": "He supports philanthropic causes through his nonprofit Wayne Foundation, but is more widely known as a celebrity socialite."}
{"sequence": "In public, he frequently appears in the company of high-status women, which encourages tabloid gossip."}
{"sequence": "Although Bruce Wayne leads an active romantic life, his vigilante activities as Batman account for most of his time."}
{"sequence": "Various modern stories have portrayed the extravagant, playboy image of Bruce Wayne as a facade."}
{"sequence": "This is in contrast to the Post-\"Crisis\" Superman, whose Clark Kent persona is the true identity, while the Superman persona is the facade."}
{"sequence": "In \"Batman Unmasked\", a television documentary about the psychology of the character, behavioral scientist Benjamin Karney notes that Batman's personality is driven by Bruce Wayne's inherent humanity; that \"Batman, for all its benefits and for all of the time Bruce Wayne devotes to it, is ultimately a tool for Bruce Wayne's efforts to make the world better\"."}
{"sequence": "Bruce Wayne's principles include the desire to prevent future harm and a vow not to kill."}
{"sequence": "Bruce Wayne believes that our actions define us, we fail for a reason and anything is possible."}
{"sequence": "Writers of Batman and Superman stories have often compared and contrasted the two."}
{"sequence": "Interpretations vary depending on the writer, the story, and the timing."}
{"sequence": "Grant Morrison notes that both heroes \"believe in the same kind of things\" despite the day/night contrast their heroic roles display."}
{"sequence": "He notes an equally stark contrast in their real identities."}
{"sequence": "Bruce Wayne and Clark Kent belong to different social classes: \"Bruce has a butler, Clark has a boss.\""}
{"sequence": "T. James Musler's book \"Unleashing the Superhero in Us All\" explores the extent to which Bruce Wayne's vast personal wealth is important in his life story, and the crucial role it plays in his efforts as Batman."}
{"sequence": "Will Brooker notes in his book \"Batman Unmasked\" that \"the confirmation of the Batman's identity lies with the young audience ... he doesn't have to be Bruce Wayne; he just needs the suit and gadgets, the abilities, and most importantly the morality, the humanity."}
{"sequence": "There's just a sense about him: 'they trust him ... and they're never wrong.\""}
{"sequence": "The details and tone of Batman comic books have varied over the years due to different creative teams."}
{"sequence": "Dennis O'Neil noted that character consistency was not a major concern during early editorial regimes: \"Julie Schwartz did a Batman in \"Batman\" and \"Detective\" and Murray Boltinoff did a Batman in the \"Brave and the Bold\" and apart from the costume they bore very little resemblance to each other."}
{"sequence": "Julie and Murray did not want to coordinate their efforts, nor were they asked to do so."}
{"sequence": "Continuity was not important in those days.\""}
{"sequence": "The driving force behind Bruce Wayne's character is his parents' murder and their absence."}
{"sequence": "Bob Kane and Bill Finger discussed Batman's background and decided that \"there's nothing more traumatic than having your parents murdered before your eyes\"."}
{"sequence": "Despite his trauma, he sets his mind on studying to become a scientist and to train his body into physical perfection to fight crime in Gotham City as Batman, an inspired idea from Wayne's insight into the criminal mind."}
{"sequence": "Another of Batman's characterizations is that of a vigilante; in order to stop evil that started with the death of his parents, he must sometimes break the law himself."}
{"sequence": "Although manifested differently by being re-told by different artists, it is nevertheless that the details and the prime components of Batman's origin have never varied at all in the comic books, the \"reiteration of the basic origin events holds together otherwise divergent expressions\"."}
{"sequence": "The origin is the source of the character's traits and attributes, which play out in many of the character's adventures."}
{"sequence": "He also speaks over 40 different languages."}
{"sequence": "Batman is often treated as a vigilante by other characters in his stories."}
{"sequence": "Frank Miller views the character as \"a dionysian figure, a force for anarchy that imposes an individual order\"."}
{"sequence": "Dressed as a bat, Batman deliberately cultivates a frightening persona in order to aid him in crime-fighting, a fear that originates from the criminals' own guilty conscience."}
{"sequence": "Miller is often credited with reintroducing anti-heroic traits into Batman's characterization, such as his brooding personality, willingness to use violence and torture, and increasingly alienated behavior."}
{"sequence": "Batman, shortly a year after his debut and the introduction of Robin, was changed in 1940 after DC editor Whitney Ellsworth felt the character would be tainted by his lethal methods and DC established their own ethical code, subsequently he was retconned as having a stringent moral code."}
{"sequence": "Miller's Batman was closer to the original pre-Robin version, who was willing to kill criminals if necessary."}
{"sequence": "On several occasions former Robin Dick Grayson has served as Batman; most notably in 2009 while Wayne was believed dead, and served as a second Batman even after Wayne returned in 2010."}
{"sequence": "As part of DC's 2011 continuity relaunch, Grayson returned to being Nightwing following the \"Flashpoint\" crossover event."}
{"sequence": "In an interview with IGN, Morrison detailed that having Dick Grayson as Batman and Damian Wayne as Robin represented a \"reverse\" of the normal dynamic between Batman and Robin, with, \"a more light-hearted and spontaneous Batman and a scowling, badass Robin\"."}
{"sequence": "Morrison explained his intentions for the new characterization of Batman: \"Dick Grayson is kind of this consummate superhero."}
{"sequence": "The guy has been Batman's partner since he was a kid, he's led the Teen Titans, and he's trained with everybody in the DC Universe."}
{"sequence": "So he's a very different kind of Batman."}
{"sequence": "He's a lot easier; a lot looser and more relaxed.\""}
{"sequence": "Over the years, there have been numerous others to assume the name of Batman, or to officially take over for Bruce during his leaves of absence."}
{"sequence": "Additionally, members of the group Batman, Incorporated, Bruce Wayne's experiment at franchising his brand of vigilantism, have at times stood in as the official Batman in cities around the world."}
{"sequence": "Various others have also taken up the role of Batman in stories set in alternative universes and possible futures, including, among them, various former proteges of Bruce Wayne."}
{"sequence": "Batman's interactions with both villains and cohorts have, over time, developed a strong supporting cast of characters."}
{"sequence": "Batman faces a variety of foes ranging from common criminals to outlandish supervillains."}
{"sequence": "Many of them mirror aspects of the Batman's character and development, often having tragic origin stories that lead them to a life of crime."}
{"sequence": "These foes are commonly referred to as Batman's \"rogues gallery\"."}
{"sequence": "Batman's \"most implacable foe\" is the Joker, a homicidal maniac with a clown-like appearance."}
{"sequence": "The Joker is considered by critics to be his perfect adversary, since he is the antithesis of Batman in personality and appearance; the Joker has a maniacal demeanor with a colorful appearance, while Batman has a serious and resolute demeanor with a dark appearance."}

{"sequence": "Finger and Kane originally conceptualized Batman as having a black cape and cowl and grey suit, but conventions in coloring called for black to be highlighted with blue."}

{"sequence": "Batman also has an aircraft called the Batplane (later called the \"Batwing\"), along with various other means of transportation."}
{"sequence": "In proper practice, the \"bat\" prefix (as in Batmobile or batarang) is rarely used by Batman himself when referring to his equipment, particularly after some portrayals (primarily the 1960s \"Batman\" live-action television show and the \"Super Friends\" animated series) stretched the practice to campy proportions."}
{"sequence": "For example, the 1960s television show depicted a Batboat, Bat-Sub, and Batcycle, among other bat-themed vehicles."}
{"sequence": "The 1960s television series Batman has an arsenal that includes such \"bat-\" names as the Bat-computer, Bat-scanner, bat-radar, bat-cuffs, bat-pontoons, bat-drinking water dispenser, bat-camera with polarized bat-filter, bat-shark repellent bat-spray, and Bat-rope."}

{"sequence": "In \"The Dark Knight Returns\", Batman tells Carrie Kelley that the original Robin came up with the name \"Batmobile\" when he was young, since that is what a kid would call Batman's vehicle."}
{"sequence": "The Batmobile was redesigned in 2011 when DC Comics relaunched its entire line of comic books, with the Batmobile being given heavier armor and new aesthetics."}
{"sequence": "Batman keeps most of his field equipment in his utility belt."}

{"sequence": "Different versions of the belt have these items stored in compartments, often as pouches or hard cylinders attached evenly around it."}

{"sequence": "This allows him to attach to distant objects, be propelled into the air, and thus swing from the rooftops of Gotham City."}
{"sequence": "An exception to the range of Batman's equipment are guns, which he refuses to use on principle, since a gun was used in his parents' murder."}
{"sequence": "When Batman is needed, the Gotham City police activate a searchlight with a bat-shaped insignia over the lens called the Bat-Signal, which shines into the night sky, creating a bat-symbol on a passing cloud which can be seen from any point in Gotham."}

{"sequence": "In various incarnations, most notably the 1960s \"Batman\" TV series, Commissioner Gordon also has a dedicated phone line, dubbed the Bat-Phone, connected to a bright red telephone (in the TV series) which sits on a wooden base and has a transparent top."}

{"sequence": "Batman's history has undergone many retroactive continuity revisions, both minor and major."}
{"sequence": "Elements of the character's history have varied greatly."}
{"sequence": "Scholars William Uricchio and Roberta E. Pearson noted in the early 1990s, \"Unlike some fictional characters, the Batman has no primary urtext set in a specific period, but has rather existed in a plethora of equally valid texts constantly appearing over more than five decades.\""}
{"sequence": "The central fixed event in the Batman stories is the character's origin story."}
{"sequence": "As a young boy, Bruce Wayne was horrified and traumatized when he watched his parents, the physician Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, murdered with a gun by a mugger named Joe Chill."}
{"sequence": "Batman refuses to utilize any sort of gun on the principle that a gun was used to murder his parents."}
{"sequence": "This event drove him to train his body to its peak condition and fight crime in Gotham City as Batman."}
{"sequence": "Pearson and Uricchio also noted beyond the origin story and such events as the introduction of Robin, \"Until recently, the fixed and accruing and hence, canonized, events have been few in number\", a situation altered by an increased effort by later Batman editors such as Dennis O'Neil to ensure consistency and continuity between stories."}
{"sequence": "In Batman's first appearance in \"Detective Comics\" #27, he is already operating as a crime-fighter."}
{"sequence": "Batman's origin is first presented in \"Detective Comics\" #33 (Nov. 1939) and is later expanded upon in \"Batman\" #47."}
{"sequence": "As these comics state, Bruce Wayne is born to Dr. Thomas Wayne and his wife Martha, two very wealthy and charitable Gotham City socialites."}
{"sequence": "Bruce is brought up in Wayne Manor, and leads a happy and privileged existence until the age of eight, when his parents are killed by a small-time criminal named Joe Chill while on their way home from a movie theater."}
{"sequence": "That night, Bruce Wayne swears an oath to spend his life fighting crime."}
{"sequence": "He engages in intense intellectual and physical training; however, he realizes that these skills alone would not be enough. \""}
{"sequence": "Criminals are a superstitious cowardly lot\", Wayne remarks, \"so my disguise must be able to strike terror into their hearts."}

{"sequence": "During this time, Alfred Pennyworth arrives at Wayne Manor, and after deducing the Dynamic Duo's secret identities, joins their service as their butler."}
{"sequence": "The Silver Age of Comic Books in DC Comics is sometimes held to have begun in 1956 when the publisher introduced Barry Allen as a new, updated version of the Flash."}
{"sequence": "Batman is not significantly changed by the late 1950s for the continuity which would be later referred to as Earth-One."}
{"sequence": "The lighter tone Batman had taken in the period between the Golden and Silver Ages led to the stories of the late 1950s and early 1960s that often feature many science-fiction elements, and Batman is not significantly updated in the manner of other characters until \"Detective Comics\" #327 (May 1964), in which Batman reverts to his detective roots, with most science-fiction elements jettisoned from the series."}
{"sequence": "After the introduction of DC Comics' multiverse in the 1960s, DC established that stories from the Golden Age star the Earth-Two Batman, a character from a parallel world."}

{"sequence": "The two have a daughter, Helena Wayne, who becomes the Huntress."}
{"sequence": "She assumes the position as Gotham's protector along with Dick Grayson, the Earth-Two Robin, once Bruce Wayne retires to become police commissioner."}
{"sequence": "Wayne holds the position of police commissioner until he is killed during one final adventure as Batman."}
{"sequence": "Batman titles, however, often ignored that a distinction had been made between the pre-revamp and post-revamp Batmen (since unlike the Flash or Green Lantern, Batman comics had been published without interruption through the 1950s) and would occasionally make reference to stories from the Golden Age."}
{"sequence": "Nevertheless, details of Batman's history were altered or expanded upon through the decades."}
{"sequence": "Additions include meetings with a future Superman during his youth, his upbringing by his uncle Philip Wayne (introduced in \"Batman\" #208 (Feb. 1969)) after his parents' death, and appearances of his father and himself as prototypical versions of Batman and Robin, respectively."}

{"sequence": "After the 12-issue miniseries \"Crisis on Infinite Earths\", DC Comics retconned the histories of some major characters in an attempt at updating them for contemporary audiences."}
{"sequence": "Though the Earth-Two Batman is erased from history, many stories of Batman's silver-age/Earth-One career (along with an amount of golden-age ones) remain canonical in the post-Crisis universe, with his origins remaining the same in essence, despite alteration."}

{"sequence": "Batman works solo until the decade's close, when Tim Drake becomes the new Robin."}

{"sequence": "After the end of \"Knightfall\", the storylines split in two directions, following both the Azrael-Batman's adventures, and Bruce Wayne's quest to become Batman once more."}

The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies, of the nature of which they may be unconscious.\""}

{"sequence": "Batman has been the subject of psychological study for some time, and there have been a number of interpretations into the character's psyche."}
{"sequence": "In \"Batman and Psychology: A Dark and Stormy Knight\", Travis Langley argues that the concept of archetypes as described by psychologists Carl Jung and Joseph Campbell is present in the Batman mythos, such that the character represents the \"shadow archetype\"."}
{"sequence": "This archetype, according to Langley, represents a person's own dark side; it is not necessarily an evil one, but rather one that is hidden from the outside and concealed from both the world and oneself."}
{"sequence": "Langley argues that Bruce Wayne confronts his own darkness early in life; he chooses to use it to instill fear in wrongdoers, with his bright and dark sides working together to fight evil."}

{"sequence": "Dr. Travis Langley also taught a class called Batman, a title he was adamant about. \""}

{"sequence": "The Red Sox were a dominant team in the new league, defeating the Pittsburgh Pirates in the first World Series in 1903 and winning four more championships by 1918."}
{"sequence": "The team's history has also been marked by the team's intense rivalry with the New York Yankees, arguably the fiercest and most historic in North American professional sports."}
{"sequence": "The Boston Red Sox are owned by Fenway Sports Group, which also owns Liverpool F.C. of the Premier League in England."}

{"sequence": "Managed by Harry Wright, Cincinnati adopted a uniform with white knickers and red stockings and earned the famous nickname, a year or two before hiring the first fully professional team in 1869."}
{"sequence": "When the club folded after the 1870 season, Wright was hired by Boston businessman Ivers Whitney Adams to organize a new team in Boston, and he brought three teammates and the \"Red Stockings\" nickname along. ("}
{"sequence": "Most nicknames were then unofficial — neither club names nor registered trademarks — so the migration was informal.)"}
{"sequence": "The Boston Red Stockings won four championships in the five seasons of the new National Association, the first professional league."}
{"sequence": "When a new Cincinnati club was formed as a charter member of the National League in 1876, the \"Red Stockings\" nickname was commonly reserved for them once again, and the Boston team was referred to as the \"Red Caps\"."}

{"sequence": "For years many sources have listed \"Pilgrims\" as the early Boston AL team's \"official\" nickname, but researcher Bill Nowlin has demonstrated that the name was barely used, if at all, during the team's early years."}
{"sequence": "The origin of the nickname appears to be a poem entitled \"The Pilgrims At Home\" written by Edwin Fitzwilliam that was sung at the 1907 home opener (\"Rory O'More\" melody)."}
{"sequence": "This nickname was commonly used during that season, perhaps because the team had a new manager and several rookie players."}
{"sequence": "John I. Taylor had said in December 1907 that the Pilgrims \"sounded too much like homeless wanderers.\""}
{"sequence": "The National League club in Boston, though seldom called the \"Red Stockings\" anymore, still wore red trim."}

{"sequence": "The name is often shortened to \"Bosox\" or \"BoSox\", a combination of \"Boston\" and \"Sox\" (similar to the \"ChiSox\" in Chicago or the minor league \"PawSox\" of Pawtucket)."}
{"sequence": "Sportswriters sometimes refer to the Red Sox as the \"Crimson Hose\" and \"the Olde Towne Team\"."}
{"sequence": "Recently, media have begun to call them the \"Sawx\" casually, reflecting how the word is pronounced with a New England accent."}
{"sequence": "However, most fans simply refer to the team as the \"Sox\" when the context is understood to mean Red Sox."}
{"sequence": "The formal name of the entity which owns the team is \"Boston Red Sox Baseball Club Limited Partnership\"."}
{"sequence": "The name shown on a door near the main entrance, \"Boston American League Baseball Company\", is historical, predating the formation of the limited partnership on May 26, 1978."}
{"sequence": "The entrance also figures in Robert B. Parker's Spenser-and-baseball novel \"Mortal Stakes\"."}
{"sequence": "In 1901, the minor Western League, led by Ban Johnson, declared its equality with the National League, then the only major league in baseball."}
{"sequence": "Johnson changed the name of the league to the American League, leading teams in his league to be christened with the unofficial nickname \"Americans\"."}
{"sequence": "This was especially true in the case of the new Boston franchise, which did not adopt an official nickname until 1908."}
{"sequence": "The upstart league placed franchises in Baltimore, Maryland and Buffalo."}
{"sequence": "After looking at his new league, Ban Johnson decided that he needed a team in Boston to compete with the National League team there, and so cancelled the Buffalo club's franchise, offering one to a new club in Boston."}
{"sequence": "The Boston franchise was purchased in 1903 by Milwaukee publisher, George Brumder who sold the team one year later."}
{"sequence": "Playing their home games at Huntington Avenue Grounds, the Boston franchise finished second and third before capturing their first pennant in 1903 and repeating the next year."}
{"sequence": "Those teams were led by manager and star third baseman Jimmy Collins, outfielders Chick Stahl, Buck Freeman, and Patsy Dougherty, and pitcher Cy Young, who in 1901 won the pitching Triple Crown with 33 wins (41.8% of the team's 79 wins), 1.62 ERA and 158 strikeouts."}
{"sequence": "His 1901 to 1904 seasons rank among the best four-year runs ever."}
{"sequence": "In 1903, Boston participated in the first modern World Series, going up against the Pittsburgh Pirates."}
{"sequence": "The Pirates were heavily favored as they had won the NL pennant by 6 games."}
{"sequence": "Aided by the modified chants of \"Tessie\" by the Royal Rooters fan club and by its stronger pitching staff, the Americans managed to overcome the odds, and win the best-of-nine series five games to three."}
{"sequence": "The 1904 club was almost as good as the previous team, but due to the surprise emergence of the New York Highlanders, the Boston club found itself in a tight pennant race through the last games of the season."}
{"sequence": "A predecessor to what became a storied rivalry, this race featured such controversial moves as the trade of Patsy Dougherty to the Highlanders for Bob Unglaub."}
{"sequence": "The climax of the season occurred on the last, dramatic doubleheader at the Highlanders' home stadium, Hilltop Park."}
{"sequence": "In order to win the pennant, the Highlanders needed to win both games."}
{"sequence": "With Jack Chesbro, the Highlanders' 41-game winner, on the mound, and the score tied 2–2 with a man on third in the top of the ninth, a spitball got away from Chesbro and Lou Criger scored the go-ahead run on one of the most famous wild pitches in history."}
{"sequence": "The NL champion New York Giants declined to play any postseason series, fearing it would give their New York rivals credibility (they had expected the Highlanders to win), but a sharp public reaction led the two leagues immediately to make the World Series a permanent championship, starting in 1905."}
{"sequence": "These successful times soon ended, however, as Boston lost 100 games in 1906."}
{"sequence": "However, several new star players helped the newly renamed Red Sox improve almost immediately."}
{"sequence": "By 1909, center fielder Tris Speaker had become a fixture in the Boston outfield, and the team worked their way to third place."}
{"sequence": "However, the Red Sox did not win the pennant again until their 105-win 1912 season."}
{"sequence": "Their .691 winning percentage in 1912 still stands as the best in team history, and their 105 wins stood as the club record for 106-years, until the 2018 club won 108."}
{"sequence": "Anchored by an outfield considered to be among the finest in the game—Tris Speaker, Harry Hooper and Duffy Lewis—and superstar pitcher Smoky Joe Wood, the Red Sox beat the New York Giants 4–3–1 in the classic 1912 World Series best known for Snodgrass's Muff."}
{"sequence": "From 1913 to 1916 the Red Sox were owned by Joseph Lannin, who signed Babe Ruth, soon the best-known and one of the best players ever."}
{"sequence": "Another 101 wins in 1915 propelled the Red Sox to the 1915 World Series, where they beat the Philadelphia Phillies four games to one."}
{"sequence": "Following the 1915 season, Tris Speaker was traded to the Cleveland Indians."}
{"sequence": "His departure was more than compensated for, however, by the emergence of star pitcher Babe Ruth."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox went on to win the 1916 World Series, this time defeating the Brooklyn Robins."}
{"sequence": "In 1918, Babe Ruth led his team to another World Series championship, this time over the Chicago Cubs."}
{"sequence": "Harry Frazee bought the Red Sox from Joseph Lannin in 1916 for about $500,000."}
{"sequence": "A couple of notable trades involving Harry Frazee and the Yankees occurred before the Babe Ruth sale."}
{"sequence": "On December 18, 1918, outstanding outfielder Duffy Lewis, pitcher Dutch Leonard (who had posted a modern record 0.96 ERA in 1914), and pitcher Ernie Shore were traded to the Yankees for pitcher Ray Caldwell, Slim Love, Roxy Walters, Frank Gilhooley and $15,000."}
{"sequence": "As all three players were well regarded in Boston—Lewis had been a key player on the 1910s championship teams, Shore had famously relieved Babe Ruth and retired 27 straight, and Leonard only four years before had set a modern record for earned run average—this trade was regarded as a poor one in Boston."}
{"sequence": "Then, on July 13, 1919, submarine-style pitching star Carl Mays was traded to the Yankees for Bob McGraw, Allan Russell and $40,000."}
{"sequence": "Mays had several good years for the Yankees, but had been a discipline problem for the Red Sox."}
{"sequence": "On December 26, 1919, Frazee sold Babe Ruth, who had played the previous six seasons for the Red Sox, to the rival New York Yankees (Ruth had just broken the single-season home run record, hitting 29 in 1919.)"}
{"sequence": "Legend has it that Frazee did so in order to finance the Broadway play \"No, No, Nanette\"."}
{"sequence": "That play did not actually open on Broadway until 1925, but as Leigh Montville discovered during research for his book, \"The Big Bam: The Life and Times of Babe Ruth\", \"No, No, Nanette\" had originated as a non-musical stage play called \"My Lady Friends\", which opened on Broadway in December 1919. \""}
{"sequence": "My Lady Friends\" had, indeed, been financed by the Ruth sale to the Yankees."}
{"sequence": "During that period, the Red Sox, Yankees and Chicago White Sox had a détente; they were called \"Insurrectos\" because their actions antagonized league president Ban Johnson."}
{"sequence": "Although Frazee owned the Boston Red Sox franchise, he did not own Fenway Park (it was owned by the Fenway Park Trust), making his ownership a precarious one; Johnson could move another team into the ballpark."}
{"sequence": "His club was in debt, but Frazee felt the need to purchase its playing site (which he did in 1920)."}
{"sequence": "Further, providing the Yankees with a box office attraction would help that mediocre club, which had sided with him against Johnson and \"the Loyal Five\" clubs."}
{"sequence": "Finally, Ruth was considered a serious disciplinary problem, a reputation he amply confirmed while playing for the Yankees."}
{"sequence": "Frazee moved Ruth to stabilize Red Sox finances and cut distractions."}
{"sequence": "It was a straight sale, no players in return."}
{"sequence": "New York achieved great success after acquiring Ruth and several other very good players."}
{"sequence": "The sale of Babe Ruth came to be viewed as the beginning of the Yankees–Red Sox rivalry, considered the \"Greatest Rivalry on Earth\" by American sports journalists."}
{"sequence": "After deciding to get out of baseball, Frazee began selling many of his star players."}
{"sequence": "In the winter of 1920, Wally Schang, Waite Hoyt, Harry Harper and Mike McNally were traded to the Yankees for Del Pratt, Muddy Ruel, John Costello, Hank Thormahlen, Sammy Vick and cash."}
{"sequence": "The following winter, iron man shortstop Everett Scott, and pitchers Bullet Joe Bush and Sad Sam Jones were traded to the Yankees for Roger Peckinpaugh (who was immediately shipped to the Washington Senators), Jack Quinn, Rip Collins, Bill Piercy and $50,000."}
{"sequence": "On July 23, 1922, Joe Dugan and Elmer Smith were traded to the Yankees for Elmer Miller, Chick Fewster, Johnny Mitchell, and Lefty O'Doul, who was at the time a mediocre pitching prospect."}
{"sequence": "Acquiring Dugan helped the Yankees edge the St. Louis Browns in a tight pennant race, and the resulting uproar helped create a June 15 trading deadline that went into effect the next year."}
{"sequence": "Perhaps an even more outrageous deal was the trade of Herb Pennock, occurring in early 1923."}
{"sequence": "Pennock was traded by the Red Sox to the Yankees for Camp Skinner, Norm McMillan, George Murray and $50,000."}
{"sequence": "The loss of so much talent sent the Red Sox into free fall, even with the money Frazee earned from the trades."}
{"sequence": "During the 1920s and early 1930s, they were fixtures in the second division, never finishing closer than 20 games out of first."}
{"sequence": "The losses only mounted when Frazee sold the team to Bob Quinn in 1923."}
{"sequence": "During an eight-year period from 1925 to 1932, the Red Sox averaged over 100 losses per season, bottoming out in 1932 with a record of 43–111, still the worst record in franchise history."}
{"sequence": "One of the few bright spots on these teams was Earl Webb, who set the all-time mark for most doubles in a season in 1931 with 67."}
{"sequence": "The BoSox' fortunes began to change in 1933 when Tom Yawkey bought the team."}
{"sequence": "Yawkey acquired pitcher Wes Ferrell and one of the greatest pitchers of all-time, Lefty Grove, making his team competitive once again in the late thirties."}
{"sequence": "He also acquired Joe Cronin, an outstanding shortstop and manager and slugging first baseman Jimmie Foxx whose 50 home runs in 1938 stood as a club record for 68 years."}
{"sequence": "Foxx also drove in a club record 175 runs."}
{"sequence": "In 1939, the Red Sox purchased the contract of outfielder Ted Williams from the minor league San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League, ushering in an era of the team sometimes called the \"Ted Sox.\""}
{"sequence": "Williams consistently hit for both high power and high average, and is generally considered one of the greatest hitters of all time."}
{"sequence": "The right-field bullpens in Fenway were built in part for Williams' left-handed swing, and are sometimes called \"Williamsburg.\""}
{"sequence": "Before this addition, it was over to right field."}
{"sequence": "He served two stints in the United States Marine Corps as a pilot and saw active duty in both World War II and the Korean War, missing at least five full seasons of baseball."}
{"sequence": "His book \"The Science of Hitting\" is widely read by students of baseball."}
{"sequence": "He is currently the last player to hit over .400 for a full season, batting .406 in 1941."}
{"sequence": "Williams feuded with sports writers his whole career, calling them \"The Knights of the Keyboard\", and his relationship with the fans was often rocky as he was seen spitting towards the stands on more than one occasion."}
{"sequence": "With Williams, the Red Sox reached the 1946 World Series, but lost to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games in part because of the use of the \"Williams Shift\", a defensive tactic in which the shortstop moves to the right side of the infield to make it harder for the left-handed-hitting Williams to hit to that side of the field."}
{"sequence": "Some have claimed that he was too proud to hit to the other side of the field, not wanting to let the Cardinals take away his game."}
{"sequence": "His performance may have also been affected by a pitch he took in the elbow in an exhibition game a few days earlier."}
{"sequence": "Either way, in his only World Series, Williams gathered just five singles in 25 at-bats for a .200 average."}
{"sequence": "The Cardinals won the 1946 Series when Enos Slaughter scored the go-ahead run all the way from first base on a base hit to left field."}
{"sequence": "The throw from Leon Culberson was cut off by shortstop Johnny Pesky, who relayed the ball to the plate just a hair too late."}
{"sequence": "Some say Pesky hesitated or \"held the ball\" before he turned to throw the ball, but this has been disputed."}
{"sequence": "Along with Williams and Pesky, the Red Sox featured several other star players during the 1940s, including second baseman Bobby Doerr and center fielder Dom DiMaggio (the younger brother of Joe DiMaggio)."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox narrowly lost the AL pennant in 1948 and 1949."}
{"sequence": "In 1948, Boston finished in a tie with Cleveland, and their loss to Cleveland in a one-game playoff ended hopes of an all-Boston World Series."}
{"sequence": "Curiously, manager Joseph McCarthy chose journeyman Denny Galehouse to start the playoff game when the young lefty phenom Mel Parnell was available to pitch."}
{"sequence": "In 1949, the Red Sox were one game ahead of the New York Yankees, with the only two games left for both teams being against each other, and they lost both of those games."}
{"sequence": "The 1950s were viewed as a time of tribulation for the Red Sox."}
{"sequence": "After Williams returned from the Korean War in 1953, many of the best players from the late 1940s had retired or been traded."}
{"sequence": "The stark contrast in the team led critics to call the Red Sox' daily lineup \"Ted Williams and the Seven Dwarfs.\""}
{"sequence": "Jackie Robinson was even worked out by the team at Fenway Park, however, owner Tom Yawkey did not want an African American player on his team."}
{"sequence": "Willie Mays also tried out for Boston and was highly praised by team scouts."}
{"sequence": "In 1955, Frank Malzone debuted at third base and Ted Williams hit .388 at the age of 38 in 1957, but there was little else for Boston fans to root for."}
{"sequence": "Williams retired at the end of the 1960 season, famously hitting a home run in his final at-bat as memorialized in the John Updike story \"Hub fans bid Kid adieu.\""}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox finally became the last Major League team to field an African American player when they promoted infielder Pumpsie Green from their AAA farm team in 1959."}
{"sequence": "The 1960s also started poorly for the Red Sox, though 1961 saw the debut of Carl \"Yaz\" Yastrzemski, Williams' replacement in left field, who developed into one of the better hitters of a pitching-rich decade."}
{"sequence": "Red Sox fans know 1967 as the season of the \"Impossible Dream.\""}
{"sequence": "The slogan refers to the hit song from the popular musical play \"Man of La Mancha\"."}
{"sequence": "1967 saw one of the great pennant races in baseball history with four teams in the AL pennant race until almost the last game."}
{"sequence": "The BoSox had finished the 1966 season in ninth place, but they found new life with Yastrzemski as the team won the pennant to reach the 1967 World Series."}
{"sequence": "Yastrzemski won the American League Triple Crown (the most recent player to accomplish such a feat until Miguel Cabrera did so in 2012), hitting .326 with 44 home runs and 121 runs batted in."}
{"sequence": "He was named the league's Most Valuable Player, just one vote shy of a unanimous selection as a Minnesota sportswriter placed Twins center fielder César Tovar first on his ballot."}
{"sequence": "But the Red Sox lost the series to the St. Louis Cardinals in seven games."}
{"sequence": "Cardinals pitcher Bob Gibson stymied the Red Sox, winning three games."}
{"sequence": "An 18-year-old Bostonian rookie named Tony Conigliaro slugged 24 home runs in 1964. \""}
{"sequence": "Tony C\" became the youngest player in Major League Baseball to hit his 100th home run, a record that stands today."}
{"sequence": "He was struck just above the left cheek bone by a fastball thrown by Jack Hamilton of the California Angels on Friday, August 18, 1967 and sat out the entire next season with headaches and blurred vision."}
{"sequence": "Although he did have a productive season in 1970, he was never the same."}
{"sequence": "Although the Red Sox were competitive for much of the late 1960s and early 1970s, they never finished higher than second place in their division."}
{"sequence": "The closest they came to a divisional title was 1972, when they lost by a half-game to the Detroit Tigers."}
{"sequence": "The start of the season was delayed by a players' strike, and the Red Sox had lost one more game to the strike than the Tigers had."}
{"sequence": "Games lost to the strike were not made up."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox went to Detroit with a half-game lead for the final series of the season, but lost the first two of those three and were eliminated from the pennant race."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox won the AL pennant in 1975."}
{"sequence": "The 1975 Red Sox were as colorful as they were talented, with Yastrzemski and rookie outfielders Jim Rice and Fred Lynn, veteran outfielder Dwight Evans, catcher Carlton Fisk, and pitchers Luis Tiant and eccentric junkballer Bill \"The Spaceman\" Lee."}
{"sequence": "Fred Lynn won both the American League Rookie of the Year award and the Most Valuable Player award, a feat which had never previously been accomplished, and was not duplicated until Ichiro Suzuki did it in 2001."}
{"sequence": "In the 1975 American League Championship Series, the Red Sox swept the Oakland A's."}
{"sequence": "In the 1975 World Series, they faced the heavily favored Cincinnati Reds, also known as The Big Red Machine."}
{"sequence": "Luis Tiant won games 1 and 4 of the World Series but after five games, the Red Sox trailed the series 3 games to 2."}
{"sequence": "Game 6 at Fenway Park is considered among the greatest games in postseason history."}
{"sequence": "Down 6–3 in the bottom of the eighth inning, Red Sox pinch hitter Bernie Carbo hit a three-run homer into the center field bleachers off Reds fireman Rawly Eastwick to tie the game."}
{"sequence": "In the top of the 11th inning, right fielder Dwight Evans made a spectacular catch of a Joe Morgan line drive and doubled off Ken Griffey at first base to preserve the tie."}
{"sequence": "In the bottom of the 12th inning, Carlton Fisk hit a deep fly ball which sliced towards the left field foul pole above the Green Monster."}
{"sequence": "As the ball sailed into the night, Fisk waved his arms frantically towards fair territory, seemingly pleading with the ball not to go foul."}
{"sequence": "The ball complied, and bedlam ensued at Fenway as Fisk rounded the bases to win the game for the Red Sox 7–6."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox lost game 7, 4–3 even though they had an early 3–0 lead."}
{"sequence": "Starting pitcher Bill Lee threw a slow looping curve which he called a \"Leephus pitch\" or \"space ball\" to Reds first baseman Tony Pérez who hit the ball over the Green Monster and across the street."}
{"sequence": "The Reds scored the winning run in the 9th inning."}
{"sequence": "Carlton Fisk said famously about the 1975 World Series, \"We won that thing 3 games to 4.\""}
{"sequence": "In 1978, the Red Sox and the Yankees were involved in a tight pennant race."}
{"sequence": "The Yankees were games behind the Red Sox in July, and on September 10, after completing a 4-game sweep of the Red Sox (known as \"The Boston Massacre\"), the Yankees tied for the divisional lead."}
{"sequence": "On September 16 the Yankees held a game lead over the Red Sox, but the Sox won 11 of their next 13 games and by the final day of the season, the Yankees' magic number to win the division was one—with a win over Cleveland or a Boston loss to the Toronto Blue Jays clinching the division."}
{"sequence": "However, New York lost 9–2 and Boston won 5–0, forcing a one-game playoff to be held at Fenway Park on Monday, October 2."}
{"sequence": "The most remembered moment from the game was Bucky Dent's 7th inning three-run home run in off Mike Torrez just over the Green Monster, giving the Yankees their first lead."}
{"sequence": "The dejected Boston manager, Don Zimmer, gave Mr. Dent a new middle name which lives on in Boston sports lore to this day, uttering three words as the ball sailed over the left-field wall: \"Bucky F**king Dent!\""}
{"sequence": "Reggie Jackson provided a solo home run in the 8th that proved to be the difference in the Yankees' 5–4 win, which ended with Yastrzemski popping out to Graig Nettles in foul territory with Rick Burleson representing the tying run at third."}
{"sequence": "Although Dent became a Red Sox demon, the Red Sox got retribution in 1990 when the Yankees fired Dent as their manager during a series at Fenway Park."}
{"sequence": "Carl Yastrzemski retired after the 1983 season, during which the Red Sox finished sixth in the seven-team AL East, posting their worst record since 1966."}
{"sequence": "However, in 1986, it appeared that the team's fortunes were about to change."}
{"sequence": "The offense had remained strong with Jim Rice, Dwight Evans, Don Baylor and Wade Boggs."}
{"sequence": "Roger Clemens led the pitching staff, going 24–4 with a 2.48 ERA, and had a 20-strikeout game to win both the American League Cy Young and Most Valuable Player awards."}
{"sequence": "Clemens became the first starting pitcher to win both awards since Vida Blue in 1971."}
{"sequence": "Despite spending a month and a half on the disabled list in the middle of the season, left-hander Bruce Hurst went 13–8, striking out 167 and pitching four shutout games."}
{"sequence": "Boston sportswriters that season compared Clemens and Hurst to Don Drysdale and Sandy Koufax from the 1960s Los Angeles Dodgers."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox won the AL East for the first time in 11 seasons, and faced the California Angels in the ALCS."}
{"sequence": "The teams split the first two games in Boston, but the Angels won the next two home games, taking a 3–1 lead in the series."}
{"sequence": "With the Angels poised to win the series, the Red Sox trailed 5–2 heading into the ninth inning of Game 5."}
{"sequence": "A two-run homer by Baylor cut the lead to one."}
{"sequence": "With two outs and a runner on, and one strike away from elimination, Dave Henderson homered off Donnie Moore to put Boston up 6–5."}
{"sequence": "Although the Angels tied the game in the bottom of the ninth, the Red Sox won in the 11th on a Henderson sacrifice fly off Moore."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox then found themselves with six- and seven-run wins at Fenway Park in Games 6 and 7 to win the American League title."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox faced a heavily favored New York Mets team that had won 108 games in the regular season in the 1986 World Series."}
{"sequence": "Boston won the first two games in Shea Stadium but lost the next two at Fenway, knotting the series at 2 games apiece."}
{"sequence": "After Bruce Hurst recorded his second victory of the series in Game 5, the Red Sox returned to Shea Stadium looking to garner their first championship in 68 years."}
{"sequence": "However, Game 6 became one of the most devastating losses in club history."}
{"sequence": "After pitching seven strong innings, Clemens was lifted from the game with a 3–2 lead."}
{"sequence": "Years later, Manager John McNamara said Clemens was suffering from a blister and asked to be taken out of the game, a claim Clemens denied."}
{"sequence": "The Mets then scored a run off reliever and former Met Calvin Schiraldi to tie the score 3–3."}
{"sequence": "The game went to extra innings, where the Red Sox took a 5–3 lead in the top of the 10th on a solo home run by Henderson, a double by Boggs and an RBI single by second baseman Marty Barrett."}
{"sequence": "After recording two outs in the bottom of the 10th, a graphic appeared on the NBC telecast hailing Barrett as the Player of the Game and Bruce Hurst as Most Valuable Player of the World Series."}
{"sequence": "A message even appeared briefly on the Shea Stadium scoreboard congratulating the Red Sox as world champions."}
{"sequence": "After so many years of abject frustration, Red Sox fans around the world could taste victory."}
{"sequence": "With the count at two balls and one strike, Mets catcher Gary Carter hit a single."}
{"sequence": "It was followed by singles by Kevin Mitchell and Ray Knight."}
{"sequence": "With Mookie Wilson batting, a wild pitch by Bob Stanley tied the game at 5."}
{"sequence": "Wilson then hit a slow ground ball to first; the ball rolled through Bill Buckner's legs, allowing Knight to score the winning run from second."}
{"sequence": "While Buckner was singled out as responsible for the loss, many observers—as well as both Wilson and Buckner—have noted that even if Buckner had fielded the ball cleanly, the speedy Wilson probably would have still been safe, leaving the game-winning run at third with two out."}
{"sequence": "Many observers questioned why Buckner was in the game at that point considering he had bad knees and that Dave Stapleton had come in as a late-inning defensive replacement in prior series games."}
{"sequence": "It appeared as though McNamara was trying to reward Buckner for his long and illustrious career by leaving him in the game."}
{"sequence": "After falling behind 3–0, the Mets then won Game 7, concluding the devastating collapse and feeding the myth that the Red Sox were \"cursed.\""}
{"sequence": "This World Series loss had a strange twist: Red Sox General Manager Lou Gorman was vice-president, player personnel, of the Mets from 1980 to 1983."}
{"sequence": "Working under Mets' GM Frank Cashen, with whom Gorman served with the Orioles, he helped lay the foundation for the Mets' championship."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox returned to the postseason in 1988."}
{"sequence": "With the club in fourth place midway through the 1988 season at the All-Star break, manager John McNamara was fired and replaced by Walpole resident and longtime minor-league manager Joe Morgan on July 15."}
{"sequence": "The club immediately won 12 games in a row, and 19 of 20 overall, to surge to the AL East title in what was called \"Morgan Magic\"."}
{"sequence": "But the magic was short-lived, as the team was swept by the Oakland Athletics in the ALCS."}
{"sequence": "The Most Valuable Player of that Series was former Red Sox pitcher and Baseball Hall of Fame player Dennis Eckersley, who saved all four wins for Oakland."}
{"sequence": "Two years later, in 1990, the Red Sox again won the division and face the Athletics in the ALCS."}
{"sequence": "However, the outcome was the same, with the A's sweeping the ALCS in four straight."}
{"sequence": "In 1990, Yankees fans started to chant \"1918!\""}
{"sequence": "to taunt the Red Sox."}
{"sequence": "The demeaning chant echoed at Yankee Stadium each time the Red Sox were there."}
{"sequence": "Also, Fenway Park became the scene of Bucky Dent's worst moment as a manager, although it was where he had his greatest triumph."}
{"sequence": "In June, when the Red Sox swept the Yankees during a four-game series at Fenway Park, the Yankees fired Dent as their manager."}
{"sequence": "Red Sox fans felt retribution to Dent being fired on their field, but the Yankees used him as a scapegoat."}
{"sequence": "However, Dan Shaughnessy of \"The Boston Globe\" severely criticized Yankees Owner George Steinbrenner for firing Dent—his 18th managerial change in as many years since becoming owner—in Boston and said he should \"have waited until the Yankees got to Baltimore\" to fire Dent."}
{"sequence": "He said that \"if Dent had been fired in Seattle or Milwaukee, this would have been just another event in an endless line of George's jettisons."}
{"sequence": "But it happened in Boston and the nightly news had its hook.\" \""}
{"sequence": "The firing was only special because ... it's the first time a Yankee manager—who was also a Red Sox demon—was purged on the ancient Indian burial grounds of the Back Bay.\""}
{"sequence": "However, Bill Pennington called the firing of Dent \"merciless.\""}
{"sequence": "Tom Yawkey died in 1976, and his wife Jean R. Yawkey took control of the team until her death in 1992."}
{"sequence": "Their initials are shown in two stripes on the left field wall in Morse code."}
{"sequence": "Upon Jean's death, control of the team passed to the Yawkey Trust, led by John Harrington."}
{"sequence": "The trust sold the team in 2002, concluding 70 years of Yawkey ownership."}
{"sequence": "In 1994, General Manager Lou Gorman was replaced by Dan Duquette, a Massachusetts native who had worked for the Montreal Expos."}
{"sequence": "Duquette revived the team's farm system, which during his tenure produced players such as Nomar Garciaparra, Carl Pavano and David Eckstein."}
{"sequence": "Duquette also spent money on free agents, notably an 8-year, $160 million deal for Manny Ramírez after the 2000 season."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox won the newly realigned American League East in 1995, finishing seven games ahead of the Yankees."}
{"sequence": "However, they were swept in three games in the ALDS by the Cleveland Indians."}
{"sequence": "Their postseason losing streak reached 13 straight games, dating back to the 1986 World Series."}
{"sequence": "Roger Clemens tied his major league record by fanning 20 Detroit Tigers on September 18, 1996 in one of his final appearances in a Red Sox uniform."}
{"sequence": "After Clemens had turned 30 and then had four seasons, 1993–96, which were by his standards mediocre at best, Duquette said the pitcher was entering \"the twilight of his career\"."}
{"sequence": "Clemens went on to pitch well for another ten years and win four more Cy Young Awards."}
{"sequence": "Out of contention in 1997, the team traded closer Heathcliff Slocumb to Seattle for catching prospect Jason Varitek and right-handed pitcher Derek Lowe."}
{"sequence": "Prior to the start of the 1998 season, the Red Sox dealt pitchers Tony Armas, Jr. and Carl Pavano to the Montreal Expos for pitcher Pedro Martínez."}
{"sequence": "Martínez became the anchor of the team's pitching staff and turned in several outstanding seasons."}
{"sequence": "In 1998, the team won the American League Wild Card, but again lost the American League Division Series to the Indians."}
{"sequence": "In 1999, Duquette called Fenway Park \"economically obsolete\" and, along with Red Sox ownership, led a push for a new stadium."}
{"sequence": "On the field, the 1999 Red Sox were finally able to overturn their fortunes against the Indians."}
{"sequence": "Cleveland took a 2–0 series lead, but Boston won the next three games behind strong pitching by Derek Lowe, Pedro Martínez and his brother Ramón Martínez."}
{"sequence": "Game 4's 23–7 win by the Red Sox was the highest-scoring playoff game in major league history."}
{"sequence": "Game 5 began with the Indians taking a 5–2 lead after two innings, but Pedro Martínez, nursing a shoulder injury, came on in the fourth inning and pitched six innings without allowing a hit while the team's offense rallied for a 12–8 win behind two home runs and seven runs batted in from outfielder Troy O'Leary."}
{"sequence": "After the ALDS victory, the Red Sox lost the American League Championship Series to the Yankees, four games to one."}
{"sequence": "The one bright spot was a lopsided win for the Red Sox in the much-hyped Martinez-Clemens game."}
{"sequence": "In 2002, the Red Sox were sold by Yawkey trustee and president Harrington to New England Sports Ventures, a consortium headed by principal owner John Henry."}
{"sequence": "Tom Werner served as executive chairman, Larry Lucchino served as president and CEO, and serving as vice chairman was Les Otten."}
{"sequence": "Dan Duquette was fired as GM of the club on February 28, with former Angels GM Mike Port taking the helm for the 2002 season."}
{"sequence": "A week later, manager Joe Kerrigan was fired and was replaced by Grady Little."}
{"sequence": "While nearly all offseason moves were made under Duquette, such as signing outfielder Johnny Damon away from the Oakland Athletics, the new ownership made additions such as outfielder Cliff Floyd and relief pitcher Alan Embree."}
{"sequence": "Nomar Garciaparra, Manny Ramírez, and Floyd all hit well, while Pedro Martínez put up his usual outstanding numbers."}
{"sequence": "Derek Lowe, newly converted into a starter, won 20 games—becoming the first player to save 20 games and win 20 games in back-to-back seasons."}
{"sequence": "After failing to reach the playoffs, Port was replaced by Yale University graduate Theo Epstein."}
{"sequence": "Epstein, raised in Brookline, Massachusetts, and just 28 at the time of his hiring, became the youngest general manager in MLB history."}
{"sequence": "The 2003 team was known as the \"Cowboy Up\" team, a nickname derived from first baseman Kevin Millar's challenge to his teammates to show more determination."}
{"sequence": "In the 2003 American League Division Series, the Red Sox rallied from a 0–2 series deficit against the Athletics to win the best-of-five series."}
{"sequence": "Derek Lowe returned to his former relief pitching role to save Game 5, a 4–3 victory."}
{"sequence": "The team then faced the Yankees in the 2003 American League Championship Series."}
{"sequence": "In Game 7, Boston led 5–2 in the eighth inning, but Pedro Martínez allowed three runs to tie the game."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox could not score off Mariano Rivera over the last three innings and eventually lost the game 6–5 when Yankee third baseman Aaron Boone hit a solo home run off of Tim Wakefield."}
{"sequence": "Some placed the blame for the loss on manager Grady Little for failing to remove starting pitcher Martínez in the 8th inning after some observers believe he began to show signs of tiring."}
{"sequence": "Others credited Little with the team's successful season and dramatic come-from-behind victory in the ALDS."}
{"sequence": "Nevertheless, Boston's management did not renew Little's contract, and hired former Philadelphia Phillies manager Terry Francona."}
{"sequence": "During the 2003–04 offseason, the Red Sox acquired another ace pitcher, Curt Schilling, and a closer, Keith Foulke."}
{"sequence": "Due to some midseason struggles with injuries, management shook up the team at the July 31 trading deadline as part of a four-team trade."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox traded the team's popular, yet oft-injured, shortstop Nomar Garciaparra and outfielder Matt Murton to the Chicago Cubs, and received first baseman Doug Mientkiewicz from the Minnesota Twins, and shortstop Orlando Cabrera from the Montreal Expos."}
{"sequence": "In a separate transaction, the Red Sox acquired center fielder Dave Roberts from the Los Angeles Dodgers."}
{"sequence": "Following the trades, the club won 22 out of 25 games and qualified for the playoffs as the AL Wild Card."}
{"sequence": "Players and fans affectionately referred to the players as \"the Idiots\", a term coined by Damon and Millar during the playoff push to describe the team's eclectic roster and devil-may-care attitude toward their supposed \"curse.\""}
{"sequence": "Boston began the postseason by sweeping the AL West champion Anaheim Angels in the ALDS."}
{"sequence": "In the third game of the series, David Ortiz hit a walk-off two-run homer in the 10th inning to win the game and the series to advance to a rematch of the previous year's ALCS in the ALCS against the Yankees."}
{"sequence": "The ALCS started very poorly for the Red Sox, as they lost the first three games (including a crushing 19–8 home loss in game 3)."}
{"sequence": "In Game 4, the Red Sox found themselves facing elimination, trailing 4–3 in the ninth with Mariano Rivera in to close for the Yankees."}
{"sequence": "After Rivera issued a walk to Millar, Roberts came on to pinch run and promptly stole second base."}
{"sequence": "He then scored on an RBI single by Bill Mueller, sending the game into extra innings."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox went on to win the game 6–4 on a two-run home run by Ortiz in the 12th inning."}
{"sequence": "The odds were still very much against the Sox in the series, but Ortiz also made the walk-off hit in the 14th inning of Game 5."}
{"sequence": "The comeback continued with a victory from an injured Schilling in Game 6."}
{"sequence": "Three sutures being used to stabilize the tendon in Schilling's right ankle bled throughout the game, famously making his sock appear bloody red."}
{"sequence": "With it, Boston became the first team in MLB history to force a series deciding Game 7 after trailing 3–0 in games."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox completed their historic comeback in Game 7 with a 10–3 victory over the Yankees."}
{"sequence": "Ortiz began the scoring with a two-run homer."}
{"sequence": "Along with his game-winning runs batted in during games 4 and 5, he was named ALCS Most Valuable Player."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox joined the 1942 Toronto Maple Leafs and 1975 New York Islanders as the only North American professional sports teams in history at the time to win a best-of-seven games series after being down 3–0. ("}
{"sequence": "The 2010 Philadelphia Flyers and the 2014 Los Angeles Kings would later accomplish the feat)."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox swept the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2004 World Series."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox never trailed throughout the series; Mark Bellhorn hit a game-winning home run off Pesky's Pole in game 1, and Schilling pitched another bloodied-sock victory in game 2, followed by similarly masterful pitching performances by Martinez and Derek Lowe."}
{"sequence": "It was the Red Sox' first championship in 86 years."}
{"sequence": "Manny Ramírez was named World Series MVP."}
{"sequence": "To add a final, surreal touch to Boston's championship season, on the night of Game 4 a total lunar eclipse colored the moon red over Busch Stadium."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox earned many accolades from the sports media and throughout the nation for their season, such as in December, when \"Sports Illustrated\" named the Boston Red Sox the 2004 Sportsmen of the Year."}
{"sequence": "The 2005 AL East was decided on the last weekend of the season, with the Yankees coming to Fenway Park with a one-game lead in the standings."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox won two of the three games to finish the season with the same record as the Yankees, 95–67."}
{"sequence": "However, a playoff was not needed, as the loser of such a playoff would still make the playoffs as a wild card team."}
{"sequence": "As the Yankees had won the season series, they were awarded the division title, and the Red Sox competed in the playoffs as the wild card team."}
{"sequence": "Boston failed to defend their championship, and was swept in three games by the eventual 2005 World Series champion Chicago White Sox in the first round of the playoffs."}
{"sequence": "In 2006 David Ortiz broke Jimmie Foxx's single season Red Sox home run record by hitting 54 homers."}
{"sequence": "However, Boston failed to make the playoffs after compiling a 9–21 record in the month of August due to several injuries in club's roster."}
{"sequence": "Theo Epstein's first step toward restocking the team for 2007 was to pursue one of the most anticipated acquisitions in baseball history."}
{"sequence": "On November 14, MLB announced that Boston had won the bid for the rights to negotiate a contract with Japanese Nippon Professional Baseball superstar pitcher Daisuke Matsuzaka."}
{"sequence": "Boston placed a bid of $51.1 million to negotiate with Matsuzaka and completed a 6-year, $52 million contract after they were announced as the winning bid."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox moved into first place in the AL East by mid-April and never relinquished their division lead."}
{"sequence": "Initially, rookie second baseman Dustin Pedroia under-performed, hitting below .200 in April."}
{"sequence": "Manager Terry Francona refused to bench him and his patience paid off as Pedroia eventually won the AL Rookie of the Year Award for his performance that season, which included 165 hits and a .317 batting average."}
{"sequence": "On the mound, Josh Beckett emerged as the ace of the staff with his first 20-win season, as fellow starting pitchers Schilling, Matsuzaka, Wakefield and Julián Tavárez all struggled at times."}
{"sequence": "Relief pitcher Hideki Okajima, another recent arrival from the NPB, posted an ERA of 0.88 through the first half and was selected for the All-Star Game."}
{"sequence": "Okajima finished the season with a 2.22 ERA and 5 saves, emerging as one of baseball's top relievers."}
{"sequence": "Minor league call-up Clay Buchholz provided a spark on September 1 by pitching a no-hitter in his second career start."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox captured their first AL East title since 1995."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox swept the Angels in the ALDS."}
{"sequence": "Facing the Cleveland Indians in the ALCS, the Red Sox fell in games 2, 3, and 4 before Beckett picked up his second victory of the series in game 5, starting a comeback."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox captured their twelfth American League pennant by outscoring the Indians 30–5 over the final three games."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox faced the Colorado Rockies in the 2007 World Series, and swept the Rockies in four games."}
{"sequence": "In Game 4, Wakefield gave up his spot in the rotation to a recovered Jon Lester, who gave the Red Sox an impressive start, pitching 5 shutout innings."}
{"sequence": "Key home runs late in the game by third baseman Mike Lowell and pinch-hitter Bobby Kielty secured the Red Sox' second title in four years, as Lowell was named Most Valuable Player in the World Series."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox began their season by participating in the third opening day game in MLB history to be played in Japan, where they defeated the Oakland A's in the Tokyo Dome."}
{"sequence": "On May 19, Jon Lester threw the 18th no-hitter in team history, defeating the Kansas City Royals 7–0."}
{"sequence": "Down the stretch, outfielder Manny Ramirez became embroiled in controversy surrounding public incidents with fellow players and other team employees, as well as criticism of ownership and not playing, which some claimed was due to laziness and nonexistent injuries."}
{"sequence": "The front office decided to move the disgruntled outfielder at the July 31 trade deadline, shipping him to the Dodgers in a three-way deal with the Pittsburgh Pirates that landed them Jason Bay to replace him in left field."}
{"sequence": "With Ramirez gone, and Bay providing a new spark in the lineup, the Red Sox improved vastly and made the playoffs as the AL Wild Card."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox defeated the Angels in the 2008 ALDS three games to one."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox then took on their AL East rivals the Tampa Bay Rays in the ALCS."}
{"sequence": "Down three games to one in the 5th game of the ALCS, Boston mounted a comeback from trailing 7–0 in the 7th inning to win 8–7."}
{"sequence": "They tied the series at three games apiece with a Game 6 victory before losing Game 7, 3–1, thus becoming the eighth team in a row since 2000 to fail to repeat as world champions."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox returned to postseason play in 2009, but were swept in the ALDS by the Los Angeles Angels."}
{"sequence": "In 2010 they placed third in the division and failed to make the playoffs."}
{"sequence": "In 2011 the Red Sox collapsed, becoming the first team in MLB history to blow a 9-game lead in the division heading into September, as they went 7–20 in the final month and failed again to make the playoffs."}
{"sequence": "In December 2011, Bobby Valentine was hired as a new manager."}
{"sequence": "The 2012 season marked the centennial of Fenway Park, and on April 20, past and present Red Sox players and coaches assembled to celebrate the park's anniversary."}
{"sequence": "However, the collapse that they endured in September 2011 carried over into the season."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox struggled throughout the season due to injuries, inconsistent play, and off-field news."}
{"sequence": "They finished 69–93 for their first losing season since 1997, and their worst season since 1965."}
{"sequence": "Boston, which finished last in the American League East with a 69–93 record in 2012–26 games behind the Yankees, became the 11th team in major league history to go from worst in the division to first the next season when it clinched the A.L. East division title on September 20, 2013."}
{"sequence": "Many credit the team's turnaround with the hiring of manager John Farrell, the former Red Sox pitching coach under Terry Francona from 2007 to 2010."}
{"sequence": "As a former member of the staff, he had the respect of influential players such as Lester, Pedroia, and Ortiz."}
{"sequence": "But there were other moves made in the offseason by general manager Ben Cherington who targeted \"character\" players to fill the team's needs."}
{"sequence": "These acquisitions included veteran catcher David Ross, Jonny Gomes, Mike Napoli, and Shane Victorino."}
{"sequence": "While some questioned these players as \"re-treads\", it was clear that Cherington was trying to move past 2011–2012 by bringing in \"clubhouse players\"."}
{"sequence": "Essential to the turnaround, however, was the pitching staff."}
{"sequence": "With ace veteran John Lackey coming off Tommy John surgery and both Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz returning to their prior form, this allowed the team to rely less on their bullpen."}
{"sequence": "Everything seemed in danger of collapsing, however, when both closers, Joel Hanrahan and Andrew Bailey, went down early with season-ending injuries."}
{"sequence": "Farrell gave the closing job to Koji Uehara on June 21 who delivered with a 1.09 ERA and an MLB record 0.565 WHIP."}
{"sequence": "On September 11, the 37-year-old right-hander set a new Red Sox record when he retired 33 straight batters."}
{"sequence": "Other reasons include the trade deadline acquisition of pitcher Jake Peavy when the Red Sox were in second place in the AL East, the depth of the bench with players such as Mike Carp and rookies Jackie Bradley, Jr. and Xander Bogaerts, and the re-emergence of players such as Will Middlebrooks and Daniel Nava."}
{"sequence": "On September 28, 2013, the team secured home field advantage throughout the American League playoffs when their closest competition, the Oakland Athletics, lost."}
{"sequence": "The next day, the team finished the season going 97–65, the best record in the American League and tied with the St. Louis Cardinals for the best record in baseball."}
{"sequence": "They proceeded to defeat the St. Louis Cardinals in the 2013 World Series, four games to two."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox became the first team since the 1991 Minnesota Twins to win the World Series a year after finishing in last place, and the second overall."}
{"sequence": "The 2012 Red Sox' .426 winning percentage was the lowest for a team in a season prior to a World Series championship."}
{"sequence": "Throughout the season, the Red Sox players and organization formed a close association with the city of Boston and its people in relation to the Boston Marathon bombing that occurred on April 15, 2013."}
{"sequence": "On April 20, the day after the alleged bombers were captured, David Ortiz gave a pre-game speech following a ceremony honoring the victims and the local law enforcement, in which he stated, \"This is our fucking city!"}
{"sequence": "And nobody is going to dictate our freedom!"}
{"sequence": "Stay strong!\""}
{"sequence": "For the entirety of the season, the team wore an additional arm patch that exhibited the Red Sox \"B\" logo and the word \"Strong\" within a blue circle."}
{"sequence": "The team also hung up in the dugout a custom jersey that read \"Boston Strong\" with the number 617, representing the city of Boston's area code."}
{"sequence": "On many occasions during the season, victims of the attack and law enforcement involved were given the honor of throwing the ceremonial first pitch."}
{"sequence": "Following their victory in the 2013 World Series, the first one clinched at home in Fenway Park since 1918, Red Sox players Jonny Gomes and Jarrod Saltalamacchia performed a ceremony during the team's traditional duck boat victory parade, in which they placed the World Series trophy and the custom 617 jersey on the Boston Marathon finish line on Boylston Street, followed by a moment of silence and a singing of God Bless America."}
{"sequence": "This ceremony helped the city \"reclaim\" its spirit that was lost after the bombing."}
{"sequence": "Overall, the Red Sox team and organization played a role in the healing process after the tragedy, owing to the team's unifying effect on the city."}
{"sequence": "Following the 2013 championship, the team finished last in the AL East during 2014 with a record of 71–91, and again in 2015 with a record of 78–84."}
{"sequence": "On September 12, 2015, David Ortiz hit his 500th career home run off Matt Moore in Tropicana Field becoming the 27th player in MLB history to achieve that prestigious milestone; in November 2015, Ortiz announced that the 2016 season was to be his last."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox had a record of 93–69 and won their division in 2016, with six American League All-Stars, the AL Cy Young Award winner in Rick Porcello, and the runner-up for the AL Most Valuable Player Award, Mookie Betts."}
{"sequence": "Rookie Andrew Benintendi established himself in the Red Sox' outfield, and Steven Wright emerged as one of the year's biggest surprises."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox grabbed the lead in the AL East early and held on to it throughout the year, which included many teams honoring Ortiz throughout the season."}
{"sequence": "Despite the success, the team lost five of their last six games of the regular season and were swept in the ALDS by the eventual American League Champion Cleveland Indians."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox once again finished with a record of 93–69 in 2017, and repeated as division champions."}
{"sequence": "The team went 5–5 in their last ten regular season games and were eliminated by the Houston Astros in the ALDS in four games."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox subsequently fired their manager, John Farrell, and hired Alex Cora, signing him to a three-year deal."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox finished with a record, winning the American League East division title for the third consecutive season, eight games ahead of the second-place New York Yankees, and were the first team to clinch a berth in the 2018 postseason."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox surpassed the 100-win mark for the first time since 1946, broke the franchise record of 105 wins that had been set in 1912, and won the most games of any MLB team since the 2001 Seattle Mariners won 116."}
{"sequence": "The 2018 Red Sox were highlighted by All-Stars Mookie Betts, J. D. Martinez, Chris Sale, and Craig Kimbrel."}
{"sequence": "Betts led baseball in batting average and slugging percentage, while Martinez led in runs batted in."}
{"sequence": "Sale tossed only 158 innings due to a shoulder injury late in the year, but was otherwise superb, posting a 2.11 earned run average to go along with 237 strikeouts."}
{"sequence": "Kimbrel saved 42 games and struck out 96 batters."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox entered the postseason as the top seed in the American League, and defeated the Yankees in four games in the Division Series."}
{"sequence": "Next, they defeated the defending champion Houston Astros in five games in the League Championship Series."}
{"sequence": "Boston then defeated the Los Angeles Dodgers in five games in the World Series, for the team's fourth championship in 15 years and ninth in franchise history."}
{"sequence": "The team's motto during the season, \"do damage\", became \"damage done\" upon their victory."}
{"sequence": "Despite retaining most players from the 2018 championship team, the 2019 Red Sox won 24 fewer games, finishing third in the division and missing the playoffs for the first time since 2015."}
{"sequence": "President of Baseball Operations Dave Dombrowski was dismissed following a September loss to the Yankees."}
{"sequence": "On October 28, the Red Sox hired Chaim Bloom as his replacement, with the title of Chief Baseball Officer."}
{"sequence": "On January 7, it was reported in \"The Athletic\" that the Red Sox had used their video replay room to steal signs during their 2018 season."}
{"sequence": "On January 15, the Red Sox and manager Alex Cora agreed to mutually part ways after he was named in MLB's report about the Houston Astros sign stealing scandal, which occurred during his tenure as bench coach with the 2017 Astros."}
{"sequence": "Ron Roenicke was subsequently named Boston's interim manager."}
{"sequence": "On February 10, a trade of Mookie Betts and David Price to the Los Angeles Dodgers was made official, in a move seen as a salary dump by analysts, although denied by Red Sox executives."}
{"sequence": "In March, the start of the MLB season was indefinitely postponed, due to the COVID-19 pandemic."}
{"sequence": "In April, MLB's investigation into 2018 sign-stealing resulted in a finding of improper actions by the team's replay operator, who as a result was suspended for the 2020 season, and the team forfeited their second-round selection in the 2020 MLB draft."}
{"sequence": "The \"interim\" tag was subsequently removed from Roenicke's title."}
{"sequence": "The team struggled throughout their abbreviated 60-game regular season, contested July 24 through September 27, finishing in last place of the AL East division, with a record of 24–36."}
{"sequence": "Prior to the final regular season game, management announced that Roenicke would not return as manager for the 2021 season."}
{"sequence": "For major MLB awards, voted by the Baseball Writers' Association of America (BBWAA), Red Sox players have won the MVP Award 12 times, most recently by Mookie Betts in 2018; the Cy Young Award seven times, most recently by Rick Porcello in 2016; Rookie of the Year six times, most recently by Dustin Pedroia in 2007; and Manager of the Year twice, most recently by Jimy Williams in 1999."}

{"sequence": "Since 1993, the city of Fort Myers, Florida, has hosted Boston's spring training, first at City of Palms Park, and since 2012 at jetBlue Park at Fenway South."}
{"sequence": "In October 2008, the Lee County, Florida, Board of Commissioners approved an agreement with the Red Sox to build a new spring training facility for the team."}
{"sequence": "In November 2008, the Red Sox signed an agreement with Lee County intended to keep their spring training home in the Fort Myers area for 30 more years."}
{"sequence": "In April 2009, the Red Sox announced that the new stadium would be located on a lot north of Southwest Florida International Airport."}
{"sequence": "In March 2011, the team and JetBlue Airlines officials announced that the new field would be named JetBlue Park at Fenway South."}
{"sequence": "JetBlue Park opened in March 2012."}
{"sequence": "Many characteristics of the stadium have been taken from Fenway Park, including a Green Monster wall in left field."}
{"sequence": "Included in the wall is a restored version of the manual scoreboard that was housed at Fenway for almost 30 years, beginning in the 1970s."}
{"sequence": "The field dimensions are identical to those at Fenway."}
{"sequence": "The unofficial beginning of the spring training season for the Red Sox is Truck Day, the day a tractor-trailer filled with equipment leaves Fenway Park bound for the team's spring training facility in Florida."}
{"sequence": "2020's Truck Day was February 3."}
{"sequence": "The Yankees–Red Sox rivalry is one of the oldest, most famous and fiercest rivalries in professional sports."}
{"sequence": "For over 100 years, the Red Sox and New York Yankees have been rivals."}
{"sequence": "The rivalry is often a heated subject of conversation in the Northeastern United States."}
{"sequence": "Since the inception of the wild card team and an added Division Series, every playoffs has featured one or both of the American League East rivals and they both have squared off in the American League Championship Series three times, with the Yankees winning twice in 1999 and 2003 and the Sox winning in 2004."}
{"sequence": "The two teams faced off most recently in the 2018 American League Division Series where the Red Sox won in 4 games."}
{"sequence": "In addition, the teams have twice met in the last regular-season series of a season to decide the league title, in 1904 (when the Red Sox won) and 1949 (when the Yankees won)."}
{"sequence": "The teams also finished tied for first in 1978, when the Yankees won a high-profile one-game playoff for the division title."}
{"sequence": "The 1978 division race is memorable for the Red Sox having held a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season."}
{"sequence": "In 2003, The Red Sox lost in game 7 of the AL Championship series on Aaron Boone's walk off home run."}
{"sequence": "Similarly, the 2004 AL Championship Series is notable for the Yankees leading 3 games to 0 and ultimately losing a best of seven series."}
{"sequence": "The Red Sox comeback was the only time in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0–3 deficit to win a series."}
{"sequence": "The rivalry is often termed \"the best\" and \"greatest rivalry in all of sports.\""}
{"sequence": "Games between the two teams often generate a great deal of interest and get extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television."}
{"sequence": "The flagship radio station of the Red Sox is WEEI-FM/93.7."}
{"sequence": "Joe Castiglione has broadcast Red Sox games since 1983 (initially assisting Ken Coleman) and has been the lead play-by-play announcer since 1993."}
{"sequence": "Tim Neverett worked with him from 2016 through 2018, but in 2019, WEEI opted for a more conversational format with a variety of commentators (see the above link) alongside Castiglione."}
{"sequence": "Former Red Sox player Lou Merloni has provided color commentary since 2013."}
{"sequence": "Castiglione's predecessors include Curt Gowdy and Ned Martin."}
{"sequence": "He has also worked with play-by-play veterans Bob Starr and Jerry Trupiano."}
{"sequence": "Many stations throughout New England and beyond carry the broadcasts."}
{"sequence": "All Red Sox telecasts not shown nationally on Fox or ESPN are seen on New England Sports Network (NESN), with Dave O'Brien calling play-by-play and Jerry Remy, former Red Sox second baseman, as color analyst."}
{"sequence": "During Remy's recovery from cancer, former Red Sox players Dennis Eckersley and Dave Roberts have alternated doing color commentary."}
{"sequence": "NESN became exclusive in 2006; before then, games were shown on such local stations as the original WHDH-TV, WNAC-TV (now the current WHDH), WBZ-TV, WSBK-TV, WLVI, WABU, and WFXT."}
{"sequence": "The integration of music into the culture of the Red Sox dates back to the Americans era, which saw the first use of the popular 1902 showtune \"Tessie\" as a rallying cry by fans."}
{"sequence": "The tune saw a resurgence in popularity when a new version by Boston area band The Dropkick Murphys was featured in the 2005 film \"Fever Pitch\", which tells the story of an obsessive Red Sox fan."}
{"sequence": "The song is frequently played after home wins and inspired the name of Red Sox mascot Wally the Green Monster's \"sister\" \"Tessie\"."}
{"sequence": "Their song \"I'm Shipping Up to Boston\" was used to signify the entrance of Boston's closing pitcher."}
{"sequence": "Another song associated with the team and its fanbase is Neil Diamond's 1969 single \"Sweet Caroline\"."}
{"sequence": "The song was first introduced to Fenway Park in 1997."}
{"sequence": "By 2002, its play had been established as a nightly occurrence."}
{"sequence": "It continues to be played at every home game during the 8th inning, sung along to by those in attendance."}
{"sequence": "In 2007, Diamond revealed that the song was written for Caroline Kennedy, American diplomat and daughter of Boston icon President John F. Kennedy."}
{"sequence": "Caroline Kennedy's great-grandfather, John F. Fitzgerald, threw Fenway Park's first ever ceremonial opening pitch on April 20, 1912."}
{"sequence": "When Diamond was named a Kennedy Center Honors recipient in 2011, Red Sox executive assistant Claire Durant arranged for 80 Red Sox fans to travel to Washington for the ceremony, which culminated in them singing the song behind Smokey Robinson onstage."}
{"sequence": "Previously, the Red Sox published three official requirements for a player to have his number retired on their website and in their annual media guides."}
{"sequence": "The requirements were as follows: These requirements were reconsidered after the election of Carlton Fisk to the Hall of Fame in 2000; who met the first two requirements but played the second half of his career with the White Sox."}
{"sequence": "As a means of meeting the criteria, then-GM Dan Duquette hired Fisk for one day as a special assistant, which allowed Fisk to technically finish his career with the Red Sox."}
{"sequence": "In 2008, the Red Sox made an \"exception\" by retiring #6 for Johnny Pesky."}
{"sequence": "Pesky neither spent ten years as a player nor was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame; however, Red Sox ownership cited \"... his versatility of his contributions—on the field, off the field, [and] in the dugout ...\", including as a manager, scout, and special instructor and decided that the honor had been well-earned."}
{"sequence": "Pesky spent 57 years with the Red Sox organization; as a minor league player (1940–1941), major league player (1942, 1946–1952), minor league manager (1961–1962, 1990), major league manager (1963–1964, 1980), broadcaster (1969–1974), major league coach (1975–1984), and as a special instructor and assistant general manager (1985–2012)."}
{"sequence": "In 2015, the Red Sox chose to forgo the official criteria and retire Pedro Martínez's #45."}
{"sequence": "Martínez only spent 7 of his 18 seasons in Boston."}
{"sequence": "In justifying the number's retirement, Red Sox principal owner John Henry stated, \"To be elected into the Baseball Hall of Fame upon his first year of eligibility speaks volumes regarding Pedro's outstanding career, and is a testament to the respect and admiration so many in baseball have for him.\""}
{"sequence": "After announcing Martínez's number retirement, the official criteria no longer appeared on the team website nor future media guides."}
{"sequence": "In 2017, less than eight months after he played the final game of his illustrious career, David Ortiz had his #34 retired by the Red Sox."}
{"sequence": "Ortiz will not be eligible for election to the Hall of Fame until 2022."}
{"sequence": "At the time of his retirement, Ortiz was the only Red Sox player to have won three World Series championships since the issuance of jersey numbers starting in 1931."}
{"sequence": "Dustin Pedroia has since become the second such Red Sox player (2007, 2013, and 2018)."}
{"sequence": "The number 42 was officially retired by Major League Baseball in 1997, but Mo Vaughn was one of a handful of players to continue wearing #42 through a grandfather clause."}
{"sequence": "He last wore it for the team in 1998."}
{"sequence": "In commemoration of Jackie Robinson Day, MLB invited players to wear the number 42 for games played on April 15, Coco Crisp (CF), David Ortiz (DH), and DeMarlo Hale (Coach) did that in 2007 and again in 2008."}
{"sequence": "Starting in 2009, MLB had all uniformed players for all teams wear #42 for Jackie Robinson Day."}
{"sequence": "While not officially retired, the Red Sox have not issued several numbers since the departure of prominent figures who wore them, specifically: There has also been debate in Boston media circles and among fans about the potential retiring of Tony Conigliaro's number 25."}
{"sequence": "Nonetheless, since Conigliaro's last full season in Boston, 1970, the number has continued to be issued to individuals, including players Orlando Cepeda, Steve Renko, Mark Clear, Ed Romero, Don Baylor, Larry Parrish, Jack Clark, Jeff Russell, Troy O'Leary, Jeremy Giambi, Ellis Burks, Adam Hyzdu, Mike Lowell, Jackie Bradley Jr., Kyle Kendrick, Rajai Davis, Steve Pearce and Kevin Plawecki; coach Dwight Evans, and manager Bobby Valentine."}
{"sequence": "Until the late 1990s, the numbers originally hung on the right-field facade in the order in which they were retired: 9–4–1–8."}
{"sequence": "It was pointed out that the numbers, when read as a date (9/4/18), marked the eve of the first game of the 1918 World Series, the last championship series that the Red Sox won before 2004."}
{"sequence": "After the facade was repainted, the numbers were rearranged in numerical order."}
{"sequence": "In 2012, the numbers were rearranged again in chronological order of retirement (9, 4, 1, 8, 27, 6, 14) followed by Robinson's 42."}
{"sequence": "As additional numbers are retired (e.g.: Martinez's 45, Boggs's 26, Ortiz's 34), Robinson's 42 is moved to the right so it remains the right-most number hanging."}
{"sequence": "Since 1995, the team has maintained its own hall of fame, recognizing distinguished careers of former uniformed and non-uniformed team personnel."}
{"sequence": "Red Sox personnel inducted to the National Baseball Hall of Fame are automatically inducted to the team's hall of fame."}
{"sequence": "Other honorees are chosen via a 15-member selection committee."}
{"sequence": "The Boston Red Sox farm system consists of eight minor league affiliates."}
{"sequence": "Baltimore Orioles The Baltimore Orioles are an American professional baseball team based in Baltimore, Maryland."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles compete in Major League Baseball (MLB) as a member club of the American League (AL) East division."}
{"sequence": "As one of the American League's eight charter teams in 1901, this particular franchise spent its first year as a major league club in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, as the Milwaukee Brewers before moving to St. Louis, Missouri, to become the St. Louis Browns in 1902."}
{"sequence": "After 52 years in St. Louis, the franchise was purchased in November 1953 by a syndicate of Baltimore business and civic interests led by attorney and civic activist Clarence Miles and Mayor Thomas D'Alesandro Jr. The team's current owner is American trial lawyer Peter Angelos."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles adopted their team name in honor of the official state bird of Maryland; it had also been used by several previous major and minor league baseball clubs in Baltimore, including another AL charter member franchise also named the \"Baltimore Orioles\", which moved north in 1903 to eventually become the New York Yankees."}
{"sequence": "Nicknames for the team include the \"O's\" and the \"Birds\"."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles experienced their greatest success from 1966 to 1983, when they made six World Series appearances, winning three of them (1966, 1970, 1983)."}
{"sequence": "This era of the club featured several future Hall of Famers who would later be inducted representing the Orioles, such as third baseman Brooks Robinson, outfielder Frank Robinson, starting pitcher Jim Palmer, first baseman Eddie Murray, shortstop Cal Ripken Jr., and manager Earl Weaver."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles have won a total of nine division championships (1969–1971, 1973–1974, 1979, 1983, 1997, 2014), six pennants (1966, 1969–1971, 1979, 1983), and three wild card berths (1996, 2012, 2016)."}
{"sequence": "After suffering a stretch of 14 straight losing seasons from 1998 to 2011, the team qualified for the postseason three times under manager Buck Showalter and general manager Dan Duquette, including a division title and advancement to the American League Championship Series for the first time in 17 years in 2014."}
{"sequence": "However the 2018 team lost 115 games, prompting the team to move on from Showalter and Duquette following the season's conclusion."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles' current manager is Brandon Hyde, while Mike Elias serves as general manager and executive vice president."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles are also well known for their influential ballpark, Oriole Park at Camden Yards, which opened in 1992 in downtown Baltimore."}
{"sequence": "From 1901 through the end of 2020, the franchise's overall win-loss record is 8793-9763 (a 0.474 win-loss percentage)."}
{"sequence": "Since moving to Baltimore in 1954, the Orioles have an overall win-loss record of 5331-5209 (a .506 win-loss percentage) through the end of 2020."}
{"sequence": "The modern Orioles franchise can trace its roots back to the original Milwaukee Brewers of the minor Western League, beginning in 1877, when the league reorganized."}
{"sequence": "The Brewers were there when the Western League renamed itself the American League in 1900."}
{"sequence": "At the end of the 1900 season, the American League removed itself from baseball's National Agreement (the formal understanding between the NL and the minor leagues)."}
{"sequence": "Two months later, the AL declared itself a competing major league."}
{"sequence": "As a result of several franchise shifts, the Brewers were one of only two Western League teams that didn't fold, move or get kicked out of the league (the other being the Detroit Tigers)."}
{"sequence": "In its first game in the American League, the team lost to the Detroit Tigers 14–13 after surrendering a nine-run lead in the 9th inning."}
{"sequence": "To this day, it is a major league record for the biggest deficit overcome that late in the game."}
{"sequence": "In the first American League season in 1901, they finished last (eighth place) with a record of 48–89."}
{"sequence": "Its lone Major League season, the team played at Lloyd Street Grounds, between 16th and 18th Streets in Milwaukee."}
{"sequence": "After one year in Milwaukee, the club relocated to St Louis, and for a while enjoyed some success, especially in the 1920s behind Hall of Fame first baseman George Sisler."}
{"sequence": "However, the team's fortunes declined from then on, as playing success and gate receipts instead went increasingly to the Browns' own tenants at Sportsman's Park, the National League Cardinals."}
{"sequence": "During this period the Browns won only one pennant, in the 1944 season stocked with wartime replacement players, and lost to the Cardinals in the third and last World Series ever played entirely in one ballpark."}
{"sequence": "In 1953, with the Browns unable to afford even stadium upkeep, owner Bill Veeck sold Sportsman's Park to the Cardinals and attempted to move the club back to Milwaukee, but this was vetoed by the other American League owners."}
{"sequence": "Instead, Veeck sold his franchise to a partnership of Baltimore businessmen."}
{"sequence": "Because Veeck was unpopular with fellow American League owners, his leaving baseball was a condition for the AL owners to approve the move."}
{"sequence": "The Miles-Krieger (Gunther Brewing Company)-Hoffberger group renamed their new team the Baltimore Orioles soon after taking control of the franchise."}
{"sequence": "The name has a rich history in Baltimore, having been used by a National League team in the 1890s."}
{"sequence": "In 1901, Baltimore and John McGraw were awarded an expansion franchise in the growing American League, naming the team the Orioles."}
{"sequence": "After a battle with Ban Johnson, the Head of the American League in 1902, McGraw took many of the top players including Walter Scott \"Steve\" Brodie, Dan McGann, Roger Bresnahan, and Joe McGinnity to the New York Giants."}
{"sequence": "As an affront to Johnson, McGraw kept the black and orange colors of the New York Giants, which San Francisco wears to this day."}
{"sequence": "In 1903, the franchise—the remaining players, assets and debts, the corporation—was transferred to New York where they were nicknamed the Highlanders until circa 1912, by which time Yanks or Yankees had taken over as their popular moniker."}
{"sequence": "As a member of the high-minor league level International League, the Orioles competed at what is now known as the AAA level from 1903 to 1953; the IL Orioles' most famous player was a local Baltimore product, hard-hitting left-handed pitcher Babe Ruth."}
{"sequence": "When Oriole Park burned down in 1944, the team moved to a temporary home, Municipal Stadium, where they won the Junior World Series."}
{"sequence": "Their large postseason crowds caught the attention of the major leagues, eventually leading to a new MLB franchise in Baltimore."}
{"sequence": "After starting the 1954 campaign with a two-game split against the Tigers in Detroit, the Orioles returned to Baltimore on April 15 to a welcoming parade that wound through the streets of downtown, with an estimated 350,000 spectators lining the route."}
{"sequence": "In its first-ever home opener at Memorial Stadium later in the afternoon, they treated a sellout crowd of 46,354 to a 3–1 victory over the Chicago White Sox."}
{"sequence": "The remainder of the season would not be as pleasant, with the team enduring 100 losses while avoiding the AL cellar by only three games."}
{"sequence": "With fellow investors both frustrated with his domination of the franchise's business operations and dissatisfied with yet another seventh-place finish, Clarence Miles resigned in early November 1955."}
{"sequence": "Real estate developer James Keelty Jr. succeeded him as president with investment banker Joseph Iglehart the new board chairman."}
{"sequence": "The seeds of long-term success were planted on September 14, 1954, when the Orioles hired Paul Richards to become the ballclub's manager and general manager."}
{"sequence": "He laid the foundation for what would years later be called the Oriole Way."}
{"sequence": "The instruction of baseball fundamentals became uniform in every detail between all classes within the organization."}
{"sequence": "Players were patiently refined until fundamentally sound instead of being hastily advanced to the next level."}
{"sequence": "For the remainder of the 1950s, the Orioles crawled up the standings, reaching as high as fifth place with a 76–76 record in 1957."}
{"sequence": "Richards succeeded in stocking the franchise with a plethora of young talent which included Dave Nicholson, Pete Ward, Ron Hansen (1960 AL Rookie of the Year), Milt Pappas, Jerry Adair, Steve Barber (20 wins in 1963), Boog Powell, Dave McNally, and Brooks Robinson."}
{"sequence": "Unfortunately, Richards also had the tendency to recklessly spend money on individuals with dubious baseball skills."}
{"sequence": "This became a major problem as bidding wars between the ballclubs to land the best amateur players escalated signing bonuses."}
{"sequence": "The solution came on November 5, 1958, when Lee MacPhail was appointed general manager, allowing Richards to focus on his managerial duties."}
{"sequence": "MacPhail added much-needed discipline to the scouting staff by establishing cross-checkers who thoroughly evaluated young hopefuls to determine whether they were worthy of being tendered a contract."}
{"sequence": "He also accepted the title of president after Keelty resigned in mid-December 1959."}
{"sequence": "One month prior to the end of the 1961 season, Richards resigned as the team's skipper to become the general manager of the expansion Houston Colt .45s."}
{"sequence": "A year earlier, he succeeded in establishing the Orioles as a legitimate contender when they stood atop the AL standings as late as early September before finishing in second place at 89–65."}
{"sequence": "In 1964, the Birds, piloted by Hank Bauer in his first year of managing the ballclub, were involved in a tight pennant race against the Yankees and White Sox."}
{"sequence": "They ended up in third place with a 97–65 record, only two games out."}
{"sequence": "It has been suggested they would likely have advanced to the Fall Classic had it not been for a minor wrist injury that sidelined Powell for two weeks in late August."}
{"sequence": "Nevertheless, Brooks Robinson enjoyed a breakout season with a league-high 118 RBIs, and won the AL Most Valuable Player Award."}
{"sequence": "The television/radio network of CBS' purchase of a majority stake in the Yankees on September9 of that same year resulted in a change to the ownership situation in Baltimore."}
{"sequence": "Iglehart, the Orioles' largest shareholder at 32% and owner of a sizable amount of CBS stock, straightened out his conflict of interest issues on May 25, 1965, by selling his 64,000 shares in the ball-club to the National Brewing Company, an original team investor which finally had controlling interest at 65%."}
{"sequence": "Brewery president Jerold Hoffberger became the Orioles' new chairman of the board."}
{"sequence": "Hoffberger's first action was installing Frank Cashen, the Director of Advertising for the National Brewery, as Senior Vice President & Chief Operating Officer for the Orioles."}
{"sequence": "With the benefit of a deep talent pool and superior scouts, the franchise continued to make improvements at the major league level."}
{"sequence": "Three months before the start of the 1963 season, the Orioles stabilized its infield by acquiring Luis Aparicio in a transaction that involved sending a trio of homegrown players (Hansen, Nicholson and Ward) to the White Sox."}
{"sequence": "They also scoured the minor leagues for selections in the Rule5 draft (Paul Blair from the Mets in 1962, Moe Drabowsky from the Cardinals in 1965) and claims off waivers (Curt Blefary, 1965 AL Rookie of the Year, from the Yankees in 1963)."}
{"sequence": "On December 9, 1965, the Orioles traded pitcher Milt Pappas (and several others) to the Cincinnati Reds in exchange for slugging outfielder Frank Robinson."}
{"sequence": "The following year, Robinson won the American League Most Valuable Player award, thus becoming the first (and so far only) man to win the MVP in each league (Robinson won the NL MVP in 1961, leading the Reds to the pennant)."}
{"sequence": "In addition to winning the 1966 MVP, Robinson also won the Triple Crown (leading the American League in batting average, home runs, and runs batted in), a feat also achieved the following season by Boston's Carl Yastrzemski."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles won their first-ever American League championship in 1966, and in a major upset, swept the World Series by out-dueling the defending World Champion Los Angeles Dodgers, whose pitching staff was led by aces Sandy Koufax and Don Drysdale."}
{"sequence": "The only home run ball ever hit completely out of Memorial Stadium was slugged by Robinson on Mother's Day in 1966, off Cleveland Indians pitcher Luis Tiant."}
{"sequence": "It cleared the left field single-deck portion of the grandstand."}
{"sequence": "A flag was later erected near the spot the ball cleared the back wall, with simply the word \"HERE\" upon it."}
{"sequence": "The flag is now in the Baltimore Orioles Museum."}
{"sequence": "Pappas went 30–29 in a little over two years with the Reds before he was traded."}
{"sequence": "Although he would go on to have back-to-back 17-win seasons for the Chicago Cubs in 1971 and 1972, including a no-hitter in the latter season, this did not help the Reds, who ended up losing the 1970 World Series to Robinson and the Orioles."}
{"sequence": "This trade has become renowned as one of the most lopsided in baseball history, including a mention by Susan Sarandon in her opening soliloquy in the 1988 film \"Bull Durham\": \"Bad trades are a part of baseball."}
{"sequence": "I mean, who can forget Frank Robinson for Milt Pappas?\""}
{"sequence": "In the 1960s, the Orioles farm system produced an especially large number of high-quality players and coaches and laid the foundation for two decades of on-field success."}
{"sequence": "This period included eighteen consecutive winning seasons (1968–1985)a run of success that saw the Orioles become the envy of the league, and the winningest team in baseball."}
{"sequence": "During this period, the Orioles played baseball the \"Oriole Way\", an organizational ethic best described by longtime farm hand and coach Cal Ripken Sr."}
{"sequence": "'s phrase \"perfect practice makes perfect!\""}
{"sequence": "The Oriole Way was a belief that hard work, professionalism, and a strong understanding of fundamentals were the keys to success at the major league level."}
{"sequence": "It was based on the belief that if every coach, at every level, taught the game the same way, the organization could produce \"replacement parts\" that could be substituted seamlessly into the big league club with little or no adjustment."}
{"sequence": "Elaborations on the Oriole way include pitching coach and manager Ray Miller's maxim \"Work fast, change speeds, and throw strikes\" and manager Earl Weaver's maxim \"Pitching, defense and three-run homers.\""}
{"sequence": "The \"Oriole Way\" began flourishing in 1966 after the Robinson-for-Pappas deal, as Robinson won the \"Triple Crown Award\"."}
{"sequence": "His Orioles would easily sweep the Los Angeles Dodgers in the 1966 World Series."}
{"sequence": "After a mediocre 1967 season, Hank Bauer would be replaced by Earl Weaver halfway into 1968."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles would finish second in the American League."}
{"sequence": "This would only be a prelude to 1969, when the Orioles won 109 games and easily won the newly created American League East division title."}
{"sequence": "Mike Cuellar shared the Cy Young Award with Detroit's Denny McLain."}
{"sequence": "After sweeping Minnesota in the American League Championship Series, Baltimore was shocked by losing to the New York Mets in a five-game World Series."}
{"sequence": "The next year, Boog Powell won the MVP and the Orioles won another 108 games."}
{"sequence": "After sweeping the Twins once again in the ALCS, the Orioles won the 1970 World Series by defeating the Cincinnati Reds' Big Red Machine in five games."}
{"sequence": "In 1971, the Orioles won another division title thanks to four 20-game winners on their pitching staff (Cuellar, Jim Palmer, Pat Dobson, and Dave McNally)."}
{"sequence": "After defeating the young Oakland A's in the ALCS, the Orioles would lose a heartbreaking seven-game World Series to the Pittsburgh Pirates."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles would miss the playoffs in 1972, but rebounded to win the division in 1973 and 1974."}
{"sequence": "Each time, they would lose to Oakland in the ALCS."}
{"sequence": "During this stretch, the Orioles began to phase out their veteran infield by replacing Davey Johnson and Brooks Robinson with younger stars Bobby Grich and Doug DeCinces, respectively."}
{"sequence": "Johnson would be dealt along with Johnny Oates to the Atlanta Braves for catcher and 1971 National League Rookie of the Year Earl Williams."}
{"sequence": "Although Williams had hit 63 home runs in two seasons with Atlanta, he would hit only 36 homers in two seasons with the Orioles."}
{"sequence": "In 1975, the Birds acquired slugger Lee May in a trade with Houston, and traded Dave McNally, Rich Coggins and minor-league pitcher Bill Kirkpatrick to Montreal for star outfielder Ken Singleton, and future 20-game winner Mike Torrez."}
{"sequence": "Jim Palmer won the Cy Young Award, but the Orioles lost the division title to the Boston Red Sox and their mega-rookies Fred Lynn and Jim Rice."}
{"sequence": "The 1976 season brought Reggie Jackson and Ken Holtzman from a trade with Oakland, but the Orioles only won 88 games."}
{"sequence": "It was this season when the Orioles made a trade that brought them players such as Tippy Martinez and Rick Dempsey."}
{"sequence": "This young foundation, along with the departures of the unhappy Jackson and Holtzman, would create the basis for 1977."}
{"sequence": "The \"No Name Orioles\", along with Rookie of the Year Eddie Murray, won 97 games and finished tied for second place with Boston."}
{"sequence": "After finishing fourth in 1978, the Orioles finally won the division in 1979 thanks to strong play from Ken Singleton and Cy Young winner Mike Flanagan."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles defeated the Angels in the ALCS, but lost to Pittsburgh in another stunning World Series."}
{"sequence": "This started a short period of heartbreak for Baltimore which would nevertheless culminate in a championship."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles won 100 games in 1980 thanks to Cy Young winner Steve Stone who went 25–7 (.781) while leading the league in wins (a franchise record) and win-loss percentage, but the Yankees won 103 games."}
{"sequence": "Although Baltimore had the best overall record in the AL East in 1981, they finished second in each half."}
{"sequence": "As a result, they were out of the playoffs due to the postseason structure that year because of the strike."}
{"sequence": "The 1982 campaign saw Baltimore eliminated on the final weekend of the season by the Milwaukee Brewers."}
{"sequence": "In an unforgettable scene, despite the season-ending loss eliminating them from the playoffs, fans stayed to honor the retiring Earl Weaver, who would be succeeded by Joe Altobelli."}
{"sequence": "In 1983, Altobelli would lead the Orioles to 98 wins and a division title thanks to MVP Cal Ripken Jr.. The Orioles defeated the Chicago White Sox in the ALCS thanks to a 10th-inning homer by Tito Landrum in the deciding game."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles won the World Series in five games by defeating the Philadelphia Phillies."}
{"sequence": "During their most productive years and only World Series championships thus far, the Orioles saw three of its players named MVP: Frank Robinson in 1966; Boog Powell in 1970; and Cal Ripken Jr. in 1983."}
{"sequence": "Additionally, Brooks Robinson was named Most Valuable Player in 1964, just two years before the 1966–1983 golden era began."}
{"sequence": "The pitching staff was phenomenal, with four pitchers winning six Cy Young Awards (Mike Cuellar in 1969; Jim Palmer in 1973, 1975, and 1976; Mike Flanagan in 1979; and Steve Stone in 1980)."}
{"sequence": "In 1971, the team's four starting pitchers, McNally, Cuellar, Palmer, and Pat Dobson, all won 20 games, a feat that has not been replicated."}
{"sequence": "In that year, the Birds went on to post a 101–61 record for their third-straight AL East title."}
{"sequence": "Also during this stretch three players were named rookies of the year: Al Bumbry (1973); Eddie Murray (1977); and Cal Ripken Jr. (1982)."}
{"sequence": "One might date the glory years of the Orioles dating back to 1964, which would include two third-place seasons, 1964–65, in which the Orioles won 97 and 94 games, respectively, and a year in which third-baseman Brooks Robinson won his Most Valuable Player Award (1964)."}
{"sequence": "The glory years of the Orioles effectively ended when the Detroit Tigers, a divisional rival at the time, went 35–5 to open the 1984 season on the way to winning the World Series, in which Hall-of-Fame pitcher Jim Palmer retired during the 1984 season."}
{"sequence": "After winning the 1983 World Series, the Orioles spent the next five years in steady decline, finishing 1986 in last place for the first time since the franchise moved to Baltimore."}
{"sequence": "The team hit bottom in 1988 when it started the season 0–21, en route to 107 losses and the worst record in the majors that year."}
{"sequence": "The \"Why Not?\""}
{"sequence": "Orioles surprised the baseball world the following year by spending most of the summer in first place until September when the Toronto Blue Jays overtook them and seized the AL East title on the final weekend of the regular season."}
{"sequence": "The next two years were spent below the .500 mark, highlighted only by Cal Ripken Jr. winning his second AL MVP Award in 1991."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles said goodbye to Memorial Stadium, the team's home for 38 years, at the end of the 1991 campaign."}
{"sequence": "Opening to much fanfare in 1992, Oriole Park at Camden Yards was an instant success, spawning other retro-designed major league ballparks within the next two decades."}
{"sequence": "The stadium became the site of the 1993 All-Star Game."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles returned to contention in those first two seasons at Camden Yards, only to finish in third place both times."}
{"sequence": "Also in 1993, with then-owner Eli Jacobs forced to divest himself of the franchise, Baltimore-based attorney Peter Angelos, along with the ownership syndicate he headed, was awarded the Orioles in bankruptcy court in New York City, returning the team to local ownership for the first time since 1979."}
{"sequence": "After the 1993 season, the Orioles acquired first baseman Rafael Palmeiro from the Texas Rangers."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles, who spent all of 1994 chasing the New York Yankees, occupied second place in the new five-team AL East when the players strike, which began on August 11, forced the eventual cancellation of the season."}
{"sequence": "The labor impasse would continue into the spring of 1995."}
{"sequence": "Almost all the major league clubs held spring training using replacement players, with the intention of beginning the season with them."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles, whose owner was a labor union lawyer, were the lone dissenters against creating an ersatz team, choosing instead to sit out spring training and possibly the entire season."}
{"sequence": "Had they fielded a substitute team, Cal Ripken Jr.'s consecutive games streak would have been jeopardized."}
{"sequence": "The replacements questions became moot when the strike was finally settled."}
{"sequence": "The Ripken countdown resumed once the season began."}
{"sequence": "Ripken finally broke Lou Gehrig's consecutive games streak of 2,130 games in a nationally televised game on September 6."}
{"sequence": "This was later voted the all-time baseball moment of the 20th century by fans from around the country in 1999."}
{"sequence": "Ripken finished his streak with 2,632 straight games, finally sitting on September 20, 1998, the Orioles final home game of the season against the Yankees at Camden Yards."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles finished two games under .500 (71–73) in third place in Phil Regan's only season of managing the ballclub."}
{"sequence": "Before the 1996 season, Angelos hired Pat Gillick as general manager."}
{"sequence": "Given the green light to spend heavily on established talent, Gillick signed several premium players like B. J. Surhoff, Randy Myers, David Wells and Roberto Alomar."}
{"sequence": "Under new manager Davey Johnson and on the strength of a then-major league record 257 home runs in a single season, the Orioles returned to the playoffs after a 12-year absence by clinching the AL wild card berth."}
{"sequence": "Alomar set off a firestorm in September when he spat into home plate umpire John Hirschbeck's face during an argument in Toronto."}
{"sequence": "He was later suspended for the first five games of the 1997 season, even though most wanted him banned from the postseason."}
{"sequence": "After dethroning the defending American League champion Cleveland Indians 3–1 in the Division Series, the Orioles fell to the Yankees 4–1 in an ALCS notable for right field umpire Rich Garcia's failure to call fan interference in the first game of the series, when 12-year-old Yankee fan Jeffrey Maier reached over the outfield wall to catch an in-play ball, which was scored as a home run for Derek Jeter, tying the game at 4–4 in the eighth inning."}
{"sequence": "Absent Maier's interference, it appeared as if the ball might have been off the wall or caught by right fielder Tony Tarasco."}
{"sequence": "The Yankees went on to win the game in extra innings on an ensuing walk-off home run by Bernie Williams."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles went \"wire-to-wire\" (first place from start to finish) in winning the AL East title in 1997."}
{"sequence": "After eliminating the Seattle Mariners 3–1 in the Division Series, the team lost again in the ALCS, this time to the underdog Indians 4–2, with each Oriole loss by only a run."}
{"sequence": "Johnson resigned as manager after the season, largely due to a spat with Angelos concerning Alomar's fine for missing a team function being donated to Johnson's wife's charity."}
{"sequence": "Pitching coach Ray Miller replaced Johnson."}
{"sequence": "With Miller at the helm, the Orioles found themselves not only out of the playoffs, but also with a losing season."}
{"sequence": "When Gillick's contract expired in 1998, it was not renewed."}
{"sequence": "Angelos brought in Frank Wren to take over as GM."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles added volatile slugger Albert Belle, but the team's woes continued in the 1999 season, with stars like Rafael Palmeiro, Roberto Alomar, and Eric Davis leaving in free agency."}
{"sequence": "After a second straight losing season, Angelos fired both Miller and Wren."}
{"sequence": "He named Syd Thrift the new GM and brought in former Cleveland manager Mike Hargrove."}
{"sequence": "In a rare event on March 28, 1999, the Orioles staged an exhibition series against the Cuban national team in Havana."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles won the game 3–2 in 11 innings."}
{"sequence": "They were the first Major League team to play in Cuba since 1959, when the Los Angeles Dodgers faced the Orioles in an exhibition."}
{"sequence": "The Cuban team visited Baltimore in May 1999."}
{"sequence": "Cuba won the second game 10–6."}
{"sequence": "Cal Ripken Jr. achieved his 3000th hit early in the season."}
{"sequence": "A fire sale occurred late in the season, where the Orioles traded away many veterans for unproven young players and minor league prospects."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles called up many of their AAA players to finish the season."}
{"sequence": "The only acquired player who would have a long-term career with the organization was Melvin Mora."}
{"sequence": "This was Cal Ripken Jr.'s final season."}
{"sequence": "His number (8) was retired in a ceremony before the final home game of the season."}
{"sequence": "The team's first year without Ripken saw the team with a record of 63–63 at the conclusion of play on August 23, but then proceed to lose 32 of its last 36 games of the season, including their final 12 in a row to finish the season 67–95."}
{"sequence": "In an effort to right the Orioles' sinking ship, changes began to sweep through the organization in 2003."}
{"sequence": "General manager Syd Thrift was fired and to replace him, the Orioles hired Jim Beattie as executive vice-president and Mike Flanagan as the vice president of baseball operations."}
{"sequence": "After another losing season, manager Mike Hargrove was not retained and Yankees coach Lee Mazzilli was brought in as the new manager."}
{"sequence": "The team signed powerful hitters in SS Miguel Tejada, C Javy López, and former Oriole 1B Rafael Palmeiro."}
{"sequence": "The following season, the Orioles traded for OF Sammy Sosa."}
{"sequence": "The team got hot early in 2005 and jumped out in front of the AL East division, holding onto first place for 62 straight days."}
{"sequence": "However, turmoil on and off the field began to take its toll as the Orioles started struggling around the All-Star break, dropping them close to the surging Yankees and Red Sox."}
{"sequence": "Injuries to Lopez, Sosa, Luis Matos, Brian Roberts, and Larry Bigbie came within weeks of each other, and the team grew increasingly dissatisfied with the \"band-aid\" moves of the front office and manager Mazzilli to help them through this period of struggle."}
{"sequence": "Various minor league players such as Single-A Frederick OF Jeff Fiorentino were brought up in place of more experienced players such as OF David Newhan, who had batted .311 the previous season."}
{"sequence": "After starting the season 42–28 (.600), the Orioles finished the season with a stretch of 32–60 (.348), ending at 74–88 (.457)."}
{"sequence": "Only the Kansas City Royals (.346) had a worse winning percentage for the season than did the Orioles for the final 92 games."}
{"sequence": "The club's major off-season acquisition, Sammy Sosa, posted his worst performance in a decade, with 14 home runs and a .221 batting average."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles did not attempt to re-sign him."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles also allowed Palmeiro to file for free agency and publicly stated they would not re-sign him."}
{"sequence": "On August 25, pitcher Sidney Ponson was arrested for DUI, and on September 1, the Orioles moved to void his contract (on a morals clause) and released him."}
{"sequence": "The Major League Baseball Players Association filed a grievance on Ponson's behalf and the case was sent to arbitration and was eventually resolved."}
{"sequence": "In the 2006 World Baseball Classic, the Orioles contributed more players than any other major league team, with eleven players suiting up for their home nations."}
{"sequence": "Érik Bédard and Adam Loewen pitched for Canada; Rodrigo López and Gerónimo Gil (released before the season began by the club) played for Mexico; Daniel Cabrera and Miguel Tejada for the Dominican Republic; Javy López and Luis Matos for Puerto Rico; Bruce Chen for Panama; Ramón Hernández for Venezuela; and John Stephens for Australia."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles finished the 2006 season with a record of 70 wins and 92 losses, 27 games behind the AL East-leading Yankees."}
{"sequence": "On June 18, the Orioles fired Sam Perlozzo after losing eight straight games."}
{"sequence": "He was replaced on interim basis by Dave Trembley."}
{"sequence": "On June 22, Miguel Tejada's consecutive-games streak came to an end due to an injury, the fifth-longest streak in major league history."}
{"sequence": "Aubrey Huff became the first Oriole to hit for the cycle at home, on June 29 against the Angels."}
{"sequence": "On July 7, Érik Bédard struck out 15 batters in a game against the Texas Rangers to tie a franchise record held by Mike Mussina."}
{"sequence": "On July 31, 2007, Andy MacPhail named Dave Trembley as the Orioles manager through the remainder of the 2007 season, and advised him to \"Keep up the good work.\""}
{"sequence": "Facing the Texas Rangers in a doubleheader at Camden Yards on August 22, the Orioles surrendered 30 runs in the first game, a modern-era record for a single game, in a 30–3 defeat."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles led the game 3–0 after three innings of play."}
{"sequence": "Sixteen of Texas' thirty runs were scored in the final two innings."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles would also fall in the nightcap, 9–7."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles began the 2008 season in a rebuilding mode under President of Baseball Operations Andy MacPhail."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles traded away star players Miguel Tejada to the Astros and ace Érik Bédard to the Seattle Mariners for prized prospect Adam Jones, lefty reliever George Sherrill, and minor league pitchers Kam Mickolio, Chris Tillman, and Tony Butler."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles started off the first couple weeks of the season near the top of their division as players such as Nick Markakis and newcomer Luke Scott led the team offensively."}
{"sequence": "Although the Orioles hovered around .500 for much of the season, they had fallen back by September and were over 20 games behind the first place Tampa Bay Rays."}
{"sequence": "They finished the season losing 11 of their final 12 games and 28 of their final 34."}
{"sequence": "The team finished last for the first time since their 1988 season."}
{"sequence": "After the season ended, the Orioles showcased altered uniforms, with a circular 'Maryland' patch added to the left-hand sleeve of all jerseys and the grey road jerseys displaying \"Baltimore\" across the chest for the first time in a quarter-century; this reflected the arrival of the Washington Nationals, because ever since the Washington Senators had departed for Texas in 1972, the Orioles had claimed to represent the Baltimore-Washington metro area."}
{"sequence": "On June 30, the Orioles rallied to score 10 runs against Boston Red Sox after facing a 10–1 deficit in the 7th inning, winning the game by 11–10, setting a Major League Baseball record for the largest comeback by a last-place team over a first-place team."}
{"sequence": "However, the team finished the 2009 season with 64 wins and 98 losses, making it the worst record in the 2009 American League season."}
{"sequence": "Despite this, Manager Dave Trembley was re-hired for the 2010 season."}
{"sequence": "Centerfielder Adam Jones was named to the 2009 All Star team, and awarded a Gold Glove award for his defensive play."}
{"sequence": "On April 12, the team set a club record for the lowest paid attendance in Camden Yards history, only 9,129 attended the game versus the Tampa Bay Rays."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles then went 2–16 to begin the season, last in the league by quite a margin."}
{"sequence": "On June 4, with an 8-game losing streak and the worst record in the league at 15–39, the Orioles replaced Dave Trembley as manager with third base coach Juan Samuel as interim manager."}
{"sequence": "They did well at first, but then they started losing again, going 17–34 under Samuel."}
{"sequence": "The Orioles hired Buck Showalter on July 29 to be the full-time manager."}
{"sequence": "He was introduced on August2 and made his debut on August 3, after the Orioles fired Samuel."}
{"sequence": "Showalter's arrival produced, or coincided with, a turnaround; the Birds went 34–23 under Showalter to finish 66–96."}

{"sequence": "The road uniform is gray with the word \"Baltimore\" written across the chest."}
{"sequence": "This style, with noticeable changes in the script, striping and materials, has been worn for much of the team's history, but with a few exceptions: A long campaign of several decades was waged by numerous fans and sportswriters to return the name of the city to the \"away\" jerseys which was used since the 1950s and had been formerly dropped during the 1970s era of Edward Bennett Williams when the ownership was continuing to market the team also to fans in the nation's capital region after the moving of the former Washington Senators in 1971."}

{"sequence": "Bastarnae The Bastarnae (Latin variants: \"Bastarni\", or \"Basternae\"; ) were an ancient people who between 200 BC and 300 AD inhabited the region between the Carpathian Mountains and the river Dnieper, to the north and east of ancient Dacia."}
{"sequence": "The Peucini, described as a branch of the Bastarnae by Greco-Roman writers, occupied the region north of the Danube Delta."}
{"sequence": "The ethno-linguistic affiliation of the Bastarnae was probably Celtic, which is supported by the earliest historians."}
{"sequence": "However, later historical sources imply a Germanic or Scytho-Sarmatian origin."}
{"sequence": "Often they are associated with the Germans, or the peoples \"between the Celts and the Germans\"."}
{"sequence": "The most likely scenario is that they were originally a Celtic tribe, originally resident in the lower Vistula River valley."}
{"sequence": "Around 200 BC, these tribes migrated, possibly accompanied by some Germanic elements, south-eastwards into the North Pontic region."}
{"sequence": "Some elements appear to have become assimilated, to some extent, by the surrounding Sarmatians by the 3rd century."}
{"sequence": "Although largely sedentary, some elements may have adopted a semi-nomadic lifestyle."}
{"sequence": "So far, no archaeological sites have been conclusively attributed to the Bastarnae."}
{"sequence": "The archaeological horizons most often associated by scholars with the Bastarnae are the Zarubintsy and Poienesti-Lukashevka cultures."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae first came into conflict with the Romans during the 1st century BC when, in alliance with Dacians and Sarmatians, they unsuccessfully resisted Roman expansion into Moesia and Pannonia."}
{"sequence": "Later, they appear to have maintained friendly relations with the Roman Empire during the first two centuries AD."}
{"sequence": "This changed c. 180, when the Bastarnae are recorded as participants in an invasion of Roman territory, once again in alliance with Sarmatian and Dacian elements."}
{"sequence": "In the mid-3rd century, the Bastarnae were part of a Gothic-led grand coalition of lower Danube tribes that repeatedly invaded the Balkan provinces of the Roman Empire."}
{"sequence": "Many Bastarnae were resettled within the Roman Empire in the late 3rd century."}
{"sequence": "According to Polybius (200–118 BC): \"A mission from the Dardanians now arrived, telling of the Bastarnae, their numbers, the huge size and the valour of their warriors, and also pointing out that Perseus and the Galatians were in league with this tribe."}
{"sequence": "According to Livy (64 BC – 17 AD): \"The way to the Hadriatic and to Italy lay through the Scordisci; that was the only practicable route for an army, and the Scordisci were expected to grant a passage to the Bastarnae without any difficulty, for neither in speech nor habits were they dissimilar, and it was hoped that they would unite forces with them when they saw that they were going to secure the plunder of a very wealthy nation.\""}
{"sequence": "According to Strabo (64 BC – 24 AD): \"However, it is clear from the \"climata\" and the parallel distances that if one travels longitudinally towards the east, one encounters the regions that are about the Borysthenes and that are to the north of the Pontus; but what is beyond Germany and what beyond the countries which are next after Germany — whether one should say the Bastarnae, as most writers suspect, or say that others lie in between, either the Iazyges, or the Roxolani, or certain other of the wagon-dwellers — it is not easy to say; nor yet whether they extend as far as the ocean along its entire length, or whether any part is uninhabitable by reason of the cold or other cause, or whether even a different race of people, succeeding the Germans, is situated between the sea and the eastern Germans."}
{"sequence": "According to Plutarch (46–120 AD): \"He also secretly stirred up the Gauls settled along the Danube, who are called Basternae, an equestrian host and warlike; and he invited the Illyrians, through Genthius their king, to take part with him in the war."}
{"sequence": "According to Tacitus (56–120 AD): \"As to the tribes of the Peucini, Veneti, and Fenni I am in doubt whether I should class them with the Germans or the Sarmatæ, although indeed the Peucini called by some Bastarnæ, are like Germans in their language, mode of life, and in the permanence of their settlements."}
{"sequence": "They all live in filth and sloth, and by the intermarriages of the chiefs they are becoming in some degree debased into a resemblance to the Sarmatæ.\""}
{"sequence": "According to Cassius Dio (155–235 AD): \"During the same period in which these events occurred Marcus Crassus was sent into Macedonia and Greece and carried on war with the Dacians and Bastarnae."}
{"sequence": "I have already stated who the former were and why they had become hostile; the Bastarnae, on the other hand, who are properly classed as Scythians, had at this time crossed the Ister and subdued the part of Moesia opposite them, and afterwards subdued the Triballi who adjoin this district and the Dardani who inhabit the Triballian country.\""}
{"sequence": "According to Zosismus (490s–510 AD): \"He likewise left in Thrace the Bastarnae, a Scythian people, who submitted to him, giving them land to inhabit there; on which account they observed the Roman laws and customs.\""}
{"sequence": "The origin of the tribal name is uncertain."}
{"sequence": "It is not even clear whether it was an exonym (a name ascribed to them by outsiders) or an endonym (a name by which the Bastarnae described themselves)."}
{"sequence": "A related question is whether the groups denoted \"Bastarnae\" by the Romans considered themselves a distinct ethnic group at all (endonym) or whether it was a generic exonym used by the Greco-Romans to denote a disparate group of tribes of the Carpathian region that could not be classified as Dacians or Sarmatians."}
{"sequence": "One possible derivation is from the proto-Germanic word \"*bastjan\" (from Proto-Indo-European root *\"bʰas-\"), meaning \"binding\" or \"tie\"."}
{"sequence": "In this case, \"Bastarnae\" may have had the original meaning of a coalition or \"bund\" of tribes."}
{"sequence": "It is possible that the Roman term \"basterna\", denoting a type of wagon or litter, is derived from the name of this people (or, if it is an exonym, that the name of the people is derived from it) who were known, like many Germanic tribes, to travel with a wagon train for their families."}
{"sequence": "It has also been suggested that the name is linked with the Germanic word \"bastard\", meaning illegitimate or mongrel, but Roger Batty considers this derivation unlikely."}
{"sequence": "If the name is an endonym, then this derivation is unlikely, as most endonyms have flattering meanings (e.g. \"brave\", \"strong\", \"noble\")."}
{"sequence": "Trubačev proposes a derivation from Old Persian, Avestan \"bast-\" \"bound, tied; slave\" (cf."}
{"sequence": "Ossetic bættən \"bind\", bast \"bound\") and Iranian \"*arna-\" \"offspring\", equating it with the \"δουλόσποροι\" \"slave Sporoi\" mentioned by Nonnus and Cosmas, where the Sporoi are the people Procopius mentions as the ancestors of the Slavs."}
{"sequence": "The original homeland of the Bastarnae remains uncertain."}
{"sequence": "Babeş and Shchukin argue in favour of an origin in eastern Pomerania on the Baltic coast of today's north-west Poland, on the grounds of correspondences in archaeological material, e.g. a Pomeranian-style fibula found in a Poieneşti site in Moldavia, although Batty considers the evidence insufficient."}
{"sequence": "Babeş identifies the Sidoni, a branch of the Bastarnae which Strabo places north of the Danube delta with the \"Sidini\" located by Ptolemy in Pomerania."}
{"sequence": "Batty argues that Greco-Roman sources of the 1st century AD locate the Bastarnae homeland on the northern side of the Northern Carpathian mountain range, encompassing south-east Poland and south-west Ukraine (i.e. the region traditionally known as Galicia)."}
{"sequence": "Pliny locates the Bastarnae between the Suebi and the Dacians (\"contermini Dacis\")."}
{"sequence": "The Peutinger Map (produced ca."}
{"sequence": "400 AD, but including material from as early as the 1st century) shows the Bastarnae (mis-spelt \"Blastarni\") north of the Carpathian mountains and appears to name the Galician Carpathians as the \"Alpes Bastarnicae\"."}
{"sequence": "From Galicia, the Bastarnae expanded into the Moldavia and Bessarabia regions, reaching the Danube Delta."}
{"sequence": "Strabo describes the Bastarnae as inhabiting the territory \"between the \"Ister\" (the Danube) and the \"Borysthenes\" (the Dnieper)\"."}
{"sequence": "He identifies three sub-tribes of the Bastarnae: the Atmoni, Sidoni and Peucini."}
{"sequence": "The latter derived their name from Peuce, a large island in the Danube Delta which they had colonised."}
{"sequence": "The 2nd-century geographer Ptolemy states that the \"Carpiani\" or Carpi (believed to have occupied Moldavia) separated the Peucini from the other Bastarnae \"above Dacia\" (i.e. north of Dacia)."}
{"sequence": "It thus appears that the Bastarnae were settled in a vast arc stretching around the northern and eastern flanks of the Carpathians from south-east Poland to the Danube Delta."}
{"sequence": "The larger group inhabited the northern and eastern slopes of the Carpathians and the region between the Prut and Dnieper rivers (modern-day Moldova/western Ukraine), while a separate group (the Peucini, Sidoni and Atmoni) dwelt in and north of the Danube Delta region."}
{"sequence": "Scholars hold divergent theories about the ethnicity of the Bastarnae."}
{"sequence": "One view, following what appears to be the most authoritative view among earliest scholars, is that they spoke a Celtic language."}
{"sequence": "However others hold that they were Scythian/Germanic, or mixed Germanic/Sarmatian."}
{"sequence": "A fringe theory is that they were Proto-Slavic."}
{"sequence": "Shchukin argues that the ethnicity of the Bastarnae was unique and rather than trying to label the Bastanae as Celtic, Germanic or Sarmatian, it should be accepted that the \"Basternae were the Basternae\"."}
{"sequence": "Batty argues that assigning an \"ethnicity\" to the Bastarnae is meaningless; as in the context of the Iron Age Pontic-Danubian region, with its multiple overlapping peoples and languages, ethnicity was a very fluid concept: it could and did change rapidly and frequently, according to socio-political vicissitudes."}
{"sequence": "This was especially true of the Bastarnae, who are attested over a relatively vast area."}
{"sequence": "A leading reason to consider the Bastarnae as Celtic is that the regions they are documented to have occupied (the northern and eastern slopes of the Carpathians) overlapped to a great extent with the locations of Celtic tribes attested in the northern Carpathians. ("}
{"sequence": "The modern name of this region, Galicia, is generally regarded as having a later origin, in either a Slavic or Turkic language."}
{"sequence": "However, some scholars have instead suggested that the name Galicia may derive from its former Celtic inhabitants the Taurisci, Osi, Cotini and Anartes of Slovakia and northern Romania and the Britogalli of the Danube Delta region.)"}
{"sequence": "In addition, archaeological cultures which some scholars have linked to the Bastarnae (Poieneşti-Lukashevka and Zarubintsy) display pronounced Celtic affinities."}
{"sequence": "Finally, the arrival of the Bastarnae in the Pontic-Danubian region, which can be dated to 233–216 BC according to two ancient sources, coincides with the latter phase of Celtic migration into the region (400–200 BC)."}
{"sequence": "The earliest historians give a Celtic or Gallic origin to the Bastarnae."}
{"sequence": "Roman historian Livy, writing in c. 10 AD, attests that the Bastarnae spoke Celtic."}
{"sequence": "Relating the Bastarnic invasion of the Balkans of 179 BC (see Allies of Philip of Macedon below), he describes them then as \"they were not very different in either language or manners\" to the Celtic tribe of the Scordisci, a tribe of Pannonia."}
{"sequence": "The Scordisci are described as Celtic by Strabo (although he adds that they had mingled with Illyrians and Thracians)."}
{"sequence": "The Greek historian Plutarch inform us that the Roman consul Hostilius \"secretly stirred up the Gauls settled along the Danube, who are called Basternae\".\""}
{"sequence": "However, a Celtic identity for the Bastarnae is apparently contradicted by Polybius (writing ca."}
{"sequence": "150 BC), who was an actual contemporary of the events described, unlike Livy, who was writing some 200 years later."}
{"sequence": "Polybius clearly distinguishes the Bastarnae from the \"Galatae\" (i.e. Celts): \"An embassy from the Dardani arrived [at the Roman Senate], talking of the Bastarnae, their huge numbers, the strength and valour of their warriors, and also reporting that Perseus [king of Macedon] and the Galatae were in league with this tribe.\""}
{"sequence": "In addition, inscription AE (1905) 14, recording a campaign on the Hungarian Plain by the Augustan-era general Marcus Vinucius (10 BC or 8 BC), also appears to distinguish the Bastarnae from neighbouring Celtic tribes: \"Marcus Vinucius... governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the Cotini, Osi...[missing tribal name] and Anartii to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome.\""}
{"sequence": "The three names of Bastarnae leaders found in ancient sources are of Celtic origin: Cotto, Clondicus and Teutagonus."}
{"sequence": "Greco-Roman geographers of the 1st century AD are unanimous and specific that the Bastarnae were Germanic in language and culture."}
{"sequence": "The Greek geographer Strabo (writing c. 5–20 AD) says the Bastarnae are \"of Germanic stock\"."}
{"sequence": "The Roman geographer Pliny the Elder (c. 77 AD), classifies the Bastarnae and Peucini as being one of the five main subdivisions of Germanic peoples, the other subdivisions being three West Germanic groups, the \"Inguaeones\", \"Istuaeones\" and \"Hermiones\", and the East Germanic \"Vandili\"."}
{"sequence": "The Roman historian Tacitus (c. 100 AD) describes the Bastarnae as Germans with substantial Sarmatian influence, but moves on to state: \"The Peucini, however, who are sometimes called Bastarnae, are like the Germans in their language, way of life and types of dwelling.\""}
{"sequence": "Strabo includes the Roxolani, generally considered by scholars to have been a Sarmatian tribe, in a list of Bastarnae subgroups."}
{"sequence": "However, this may simply be an error due to the close proximity of the two peoples north of the Danube Delta."}
{"sequence": "In the 3rd century, the Greek historian Dio Cassius states that the \"Bastarnae are properly classed as Scythians\" and \"members of the Scythian race\"."}
{"sequence": "Likewise, the 6th-century historian Zosimus, reporting events around 280 AD, refers to \"the Bastarnae, a Scythian people\"."}
{"sequence": "However, it appears that these late Greco-Roman chroniclers used the term \"Scythian\" more often in a geographical sense (for inhabitants of the region they called Scythia, i.e. the Pontic region north of the Danube) rather than in an ethnic one (for members of the Scythian people, steppe nomads of Iranic origin, related to the Sarmatians, who had supplanted the Scythians' dominance of the steppes in the period BC)."}
{"sequence": "For example, Zosimus also routinely refers to the Goths, who were undoubtedly Germanic-speakers, as \"Scythians\"."}
{"sequence": "It is possible that some Bastarnae may have been assimilated by the surrounding (and possibly dominant) Sarmatians, perhaps adopting their tongue (which belonged to the Iranian group of Indo-European languages) and customs."}
{"sequence": "Thus Tacitus' comment that \"mixed marriages are giving [the Bastarnae] to some extent the vile appearance of the Sarmatians\"."}
{"sequence": "On the other hand, the Bastarnae maintained a separate name until ca."}
{"sequence": "300 AD, probably implying retention of their distinctive ethno-linguistic heritage up to that time."}
{"sequence": "It seems likely, on balance, that the core population of Bastarnae had always been, and continued to be, Germanic in language and culture."}
{"sequence": "According to Malcolm Todd, traditional archaeology has not been able to construct a typology of Bastarnae material culture, and thus to ascribe particular archaeological sites to the Bastarnae."}
{"sequence": "A complicating factor is that the regions where Bastarnae are attested contained a patchwork of peoples and cultures (Sarmatians, Scythians, Dacians, Thracians, Celts, Germans and others), some sedentary, some nomadic."}
{"sequence": "In any event, post-1960s archaeological theory has questioned the validity of equating material \"cultures\", as defined by archaeologists, with distinct ethnic groups."}
{"sequence": "In this view, it is impossible to attribute a \"culture\" to a particular ethnic group: it is likely that the material cultures discerned in the region belonged to several, if not all, of the groups inhabiting it."}
{"sequence": "These cultures probably represent relatively large-scale socio-economic interactions between disparate communities of the broad region, possibly including mutually antagonistic groups."}
{"sequence": "It is not even certain whether the Bastarnae were sedentary, nomadic or semi-nomadic."}
{"sequence": "Tacitus' statement that they were \"German in their way of life and types of dwelling\" implies a sedentary bias, but their close relations with the Sarmatians, who were nomadic, may indicate a more nomadic lifestyle for some Bastarnae, as does their attested wide geographical range."}
{"sequence": "If the Bastarnae were nomadic, then the sedentary \"cultures\" identified by archaeologists in their \"lebensraum\" would not represent them."}
{"sequence": "Nomadic peoples generally leave scant traces, due to the impermanent materials and foundations used in the construction of their dwellings."}
{"sequence": "Scholars have identified two closely related sedentary \"cultures\" as possible candidates to represent the Bastarnae (among other peoples) as their locations broadly correspond to where ancient sources placed the Basternae: the Zarubintsy culture lying in the forest-steppe zone in northern Ukraine and southern Belarus, and the Poieneşti-Lukashevka culture (Lucăşeuca) in northern Moldavia."}
{"sequence": "These cultures were characterised by agriculture, documented by numerous finds of sickles."}
{"sequence": "Dwellings were either of surface or semi-subterranean types, with posts supporting the walls, a hearth in the middle and large conical pits located nearby."}
{"sequence": "Some sites were defended by ditches and banks, structures thought to have been built to defend against nomadic tribes from the steppe."}
{"sequence": "Inhabitants practiced cremation."}
{"sequence": "Cremated remains were either placed in large, hand-made ceramic urns, or were placed in a large pit and surrounded by food and ornaments such as spiral bracelets and Middle to Late La Tène-type \"fibulae\" (attesting the continuing strength of Celtic influence in this region)."}
{"sequence": "A major problem with associating the Poieneşti-Lukashevka and Zarubintsy cultures with the Bastarnae is that both cultures had disappeared by the early 1st century AD, while the Bastarnae continue to be attested in those regions throughout the Roman Principate."}
{"sequence": "Another issue is that the Poieneşti-Lukashevka culture has also been attributed to the Costoboci, a people considered ethnically Dacian by mainstream scholarship, who inhabited northern Moldavia, according to Ptolemy (ca."}
{"sequence": "140 AD)."}
{"sequence": "Indeed, Mircea Babeş and Silvia Theodor, the two Romanian archaeologists who identified Lukashevka as Bastarnic, nevertheless insisted that the majority of the population in the Lukashevka sphere (in northern Moldavia) was \"Geto-Dacian\"."}
{"sequence": "A further problem is that neither of these cultures were present in the Danube Delta region, where a major concentration of Bastarnae are attested by the ancient sources."}
{"sequence": "Starting in about 200 AD, the Chernyakhov culture became established in the modern-day western Ukraine and Moldova region inhabited by the Bastarnae."}
{"sequence": "The culture is characterised by a high degree of sophistication in the production of metal and ceramic artefacts, as well as of uniformity over a vast area."}
{"sequence": "Although this culture has conventionally been identified with the migration of the Gothic \"ethnos\" into the region from the northwest, Todd argues that its most important origin is Scytho-Sarmatian."}
{"sequence": "Although the Goths certainly contributed to it, so probably did other peoples of the region such as the Dacians, proto-Slavs, Carpi and possibly the Bastarnae."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae first appear in the historical record in 179 BC, when they crossed the Danube in a massive force."}
{"sequence": "They did so at the invitation of their long-time ally, King Philip V of Macedon, a direct descendant of Antigonus, one of the Diadochi, the generals of Alexander the Great who had shared his empire after his death in 323 BC."}
{"sequence": "The Macedonian king had suffered a disastrous defeat at the hands of the Romans in the Second Macedonian War (200–197 BC), which had reduced him from a powerful Hellenistic monarch to the status of a petty client-king with a much-reduced territory and a tiny army."}
{"sequence": "After nearly 20 years of slavish adherence to the Roman Senate's dictats, Philip had been goaded by the incessant and devastating raiding of the Dardani, a warlike Thraco-Illyrian tribe on his northern border, which his treaty-limited army was too small to counter effectively."}
{"sequence": "Counting on the Bastarnae, with whom he had forged friendly relations, he plotted a strategy to deal with the Dardani and then to regain his lost territories in Greece and his political independence."}
{"sequence": "First, he would unleash the Bastarnae against the Dardani."}
{"sequence": "After the latter had been crushed, Philip planned to settle Bastarnae families in Dardania (southern Kosovo/Skopje region) to ensure that the region was permanently subdued."}
{"sequence": "In a second phase, Philip aimed to launch the Bastarnae on an invasion of Italy via the Adriatic coast."}
{"sequence": "Although he was aware that the Bastarnae were likely to be defeated, Philip hoped that the Romans would be distracted long enough to allow him to reoccupy his former possessions in Greece."}
{"sequence": "However, Philip, now 60 years of age, died before the Bastarnae could arrive."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae host was still \"en route\" through Thrace, where it became embroiled in hostilities with the locals, who had not provided them with sufficient food at affordable prices as they marched through."}
{"sequence": "Probably in the vicinity of Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria), the Bastarnae broke out of their marching columns and pillaged the land far and wide."}
{"sequence": "The terrified local Thracians took refuge with their families and animal herds on the slopes of \"Mons Donuca\" (Mount Musala), the highest mountain in Thrace."}
{"sequence": "A large force of Bastarnae chased them up the mountain, but were driven back and scattered by a massive hailstorm."}
{"sequence": "Then the Thracians ambushed them, turning their descent into a panic-stricken rout."}
{"sequence": "Back at their wagon fort in the plain, around half of the demoralised Bastarnae decided to return home, leaving c. 30,000 to press on to Macedonia."}
{"sequence": "Philip's son and successor Perseus, while protesting his loyalty to Rome, deployed his Bastarnae guests in winter quarters in a valley in Dardania, presumably as a prelude to a campaign against the Dardani the following summer."}
{"sequence": "However, in the depths of winter their camp was attacked by the Dardani."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae easily beat off the attackers, chased them back to their chief town and besieged them, but they were surprised in the rear by a second force of Dardani, which had approached their camp stealthily by mountain paths, and proceeded to storm and ransack it."}
{"sequence": "Having lost their entire baggage and supplies, the Bastarnae were obliged to withdraw from Dardania and to return home."}
{"sequence": "Most perished as they crossed the frozen Danube on foot, only for the ice to give way."}
{"sequence": "Despite the failure of Philip's Bastarnae strategy, the suspicion aroused by these events in the Roman Senate, which had been warned by the Dardani of the Bastarnae invasion, ensured the demise of Macedonia as an independent state."}
{"sequence": "Rome declared war on Perseus in 171 BC and after the Macedonian army was crushed at the Battle of Pydna (168 BC), Macedonia was split up into four Roman puppet-cantons (167 BC)."}
{"sequence": "Twenty-one years later, these were in turn abolished and annexed to the Roman Republic as the province of Macedonia (146 BC)."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae first came into direct conflict with Rome as a result of expansion into the lower Danube region by the proconsuls (governors) of Macedonia in 75–72 BC."}
{"sequence": "Gaius Scribonius Curio (proconsul 75–73 BC) campaigned successfully against the Dardani and the Moesi, becoming the first Roman general to reach the Danube with his army."}
{"sequence": "His successor, Marcus Licinius Lucullus (brother of the famous Lucius Lucullus), campaigned against the Thracian Bessi tribe and the Moesi, ravaging the whole of Moesia, the region between the Haemus (Balkan) mountain range and the Danube."}
{"sequence": "In 72 BC, his troops occupied the Greek coastal cities of Scythia Minor (modern Dobruja region, Romania/Bulgaria), which had sided with Rome's Hellenistic arch-enemy, King Mithridates VI of Pontus, in the Third Mithridatic War (73–63 BC)."}
{"sequence": "The presence of Roman forces in the Danube Delta was seen as a major threat by all the neighbouring transdanubian peoples: the Peucini Bastarnae, the Sarmatians and, most importantly, by Burebista (ruled 82–44 BC), king of the Getae."}
{"sequence": "The Getae occupied the region today called Wallachia as well as Scythia Minor and were either a Dacian- or Thracian- speaking people."}
{"sequence": "Burebista had unified the Getae tribes into a single kingdom, for which the Greek cities were vital trade outlets."}
{"sequence": "In addition, he had established his hegemony over neighbouring Sarmatian and Bastarnae tribes."}
{"sequence": "At its peak, the Getae kingdom reportedly was able to muster 200,000 warriors."}
{"sequence": "Burebista led his transdanubian coalition in a struggle against Roman encroachment, conducting many raids against Roman allies in Moesia and Thrace, penetrating as far as Macedonia and Illyria."}
{"sequence": "The coalition's main chance came in 62 BC, when the Greek cities rebelled against Roman rule."}
{"sequence": "In 61 BC, the notoriously oppressive and militarily incompetent proconsul of Macedonia, Gaius Antonius, nicknamed \"Hybrida\" (\"The Monster\"), an uncle of the famous Mark Antony, led an army against the Greek cities."}
{"sequence": "As his army approached Histria, Antonius detached his entire mounted force from the marching column and led it away on a lengthy excursion, leaving his infantry without cavalry cover, a tactic he had already used with disastrous results against the Dardani."}
{"sequence": "Dio implies that he did so out of cowardice, in order to avoid the imminent clash with the opposition, but it is more likely that he was pursuing a large enemy cavalry force, probably Sarmatians."}
{"sequence": "A Bastarnae host, which had crossed the Danube to assist the Histrians, promptly attacked, surrounded and massacred the Roman infantry, capturing several of their \"vexilla\" (military standards)."}
{"sequence": "This battle resulted in the collapse of the Roman position on the lower Danube."}
{"sequence": "Burebista apparently annexed the Greek cities (55–48 BC)."}
{"sequence": "At the same time, the subjugated \"allied\" tribes of Moesia and Thrace evidently repudiated their treaties with Rome, as they had to be reconquered by Augustus in 29–8 BC (see below)."}
{"sequence": "In 44 BC, Roman dictator-for-life Julius Caesar planned to lead a major campaign to crush Burebista and his allies once and for all, but he was assassinated before it could start."}
{"sequence": "However, the campaign was made redundant by Burebista's overthrow and death in the same year, after which his Getae empire fragmented into four, later five, independent petty kingdoms."}
{"sequence": "These were militarily far weaker, as Strabo assessed their combined military potential at just 40,000 armed men, and were often involved in internecine warfare."}
{"sequence": "The Geto-Dacians did not again become a threat to Roman hegemony in the lower Danube until the rise of Decebal 130 years later (86 AD)."}
{"sequence": "Once he had established himself as sole ruler of the Roman state in 30 BC, Caesar's grand-nephew and adopted son Augustus inaugurated a strategy of advancing the empire's south-eastern European border to the line of the Danube from the Alps, the Dinaric Alps and Macedonia."}
{"sequence": "The primary objective was to increase strategic depth between the border and Italy and also to provide a major fluvial supply route between the Roman armies in the region."}
{"sequence": "On the lower Danube, which was given priority over the upper Danube, this required the annexation of Moesia."}
{"sequence": "The Romans' target was thus the tribes which inhabited Moesia, namely (from west to east) the Triballi, Moesi and those Getae who dwelt south of the Danube."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae were also a target because they had recently subjugated the Triballi, whose territory lay on the southern bank of the Danube between the tributary rivers \"Utus\" (Vit) and \"Ciabrus\" (Tsibritsa), with their chief town at Oescus (Gigen, Bulgaria)."}
{"sequence": "In addition, Augustus wanted to avenge the defeat of Gaius Antonius at Histria 32 years before and to recover the lost military standards."}
{"sequence": "These were held in a powerful fortress called Genucla (Isaccea, near modern Tulcea, Romania, in the Danube Delta region), controlled by Zyraxes, the local Getan king."}
{"sequence": "The man selected for the task was Marcus Licinius Crassus, grandson of Crassus the triumvir and an experienced general at 33 years of age, who was appointed proconsul of Macedonia in 29 BC."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae provided the \"casus belli\" by crossing the Haemus and attacking the Dentheletae, a Thracian tribe who were Roman allies."}
{"sequence": "Crassus marched to the Dentheletae's assistance, but the Bastarnae host hastily withdrew over the Haemus at his approach."}
{"sequence": "Crassus followed them closely into Moesia but they would not be drawn into battle, withdrawing beyond the Tsibritsa."}
{"sequence": "Crassus now turned his attention to the Moesi, his prime target."}
{"sequence": "After a successful campaign which resulted in the submission of a substantial section of the Moesi, Crassus again sought out the Bastarnae."}
{"sequence": "Discovering their location from some peace envoys they had sent to him, he lured them into battle near the Tsibritsa by a stratagem."}
{"sequence": "Hiding his main body of troops in a wood, he stationed as bait a smaller vanguard in open ground before the wood."}
{"sequence": "As expected, the Bastarnae attacked the vanguard in force, only to find themselves entangled in the full-scale pitched battle with the Romans that they had tried to avoid."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae tried to retreat into the forest but were hampered by the wagon train carrying their women and children, as these could not move through the trees."}
{"sequence": "Trapped into fighting to save their families, the Bastarnae were routed."}
{"sequence": "Crassus personally killed their king, Deldo, in combat, a feat which qualified him for Rome's highest military honour, \"spolia opima\", but Augustus refused to award it on a technicality."}
{"sequence": "Thousands of fleeing Bastarnae perished, many asphyxiated in nearby woods by encircling fires set by the Romans, others drowned trying to swim across the Danube."}
{"sequence": "Nevertheless, a substantial force dug themselves into a powerful hillfort."}
{"sequence": "Crassus laid siege to fort, but had to enlist the assistance of Rholes, a Getan petty king, to dislodge them, for which service Rholes was granted the title of \"socius et amicus populi Romani\" (\"ally and friend of the Roman people\")."}
{"sequence": "The following year (28 BC), Crassus marched on Genucla."}
{"sequence": "Zyraxes escaped with his treasure and fled over the Danube into Scythia to seek aid from the Bastarnae."}
{"sequence": "Before he was able to bring reinforcements, Genucla fell to a combined land and fluvial assault by the Romans."}
{"sequence": "The strategic result of Crassus' campaigns was the permanent annexation of Moesia by Rome."}
{"sequence": "About a decade later, in 10 BC, the Bastarnae again clashed with Rome during Augustus' conquest of Pannonia (the \"bellum Pannonicum\" 14–9 BC)."}
{"sequence": "Inscription AE (1905) 14 records a campaign on the Hungarian Plain by the Augustan-era general Marcus Vinucius: Marcus Vinucius...[patronymic], Consul [in 19 BC]...[various official titles], governor of Illyricum, the first [Roman general] to advance across the river Danube, defeated in battle and routed an army of Dacians and Basternae, and subjugated the Cotini, Osi...[missing tribal name] and Anartii to the power of the emperor Augustus and of the people of Rome."}
{"sequence": "Most likely, the Bastarnae, in alliance with Dacians, were attempting to assist the hard-pressed Illyrian/Celtic tribes of Pannonia in their resistance to Rome."}
{"sequence": "It appears that in the final years of Augustus' rule, the Bastarnae made their peace with Rome."}
{"sequence": "The \"Res Gestae Divi Augusti\" (\"Acts of the divine Augustus\", 14 AD), an inscription commissioned by Augustus to list his achievements, states that he received an embassy from the Bastarnae seeking a treaty of friendship."}
{"sequence": "It appears that a treaty was concluded and apparently proved remarkably effective, as no hostilities with the Bastarnae are recorded in surviving ancient sources until c. 175, some 160 years after Augustus' inscription was carved."}
{"sequence": "But surviving evidence for the history of this period is so thin that it cannot be excluded that the Bastarnae clashed with Rome during it."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae may have been involved in the Dacian Wars of Domitian (86–88) and Trajan (101–102 and 105–106), since these took place in the lower Danube region and it is known that both sides were supported by neighbouring indigenous tribes."}
{"sequence": "In the late 2nd century, the \"Historia Augusta\" mentions that in the rule of Marcus Aurelius (161–180), an alliance of lower Danube tribes including the Bastarnae, the Sarmatian Roxolani and the Costoboci took advantage of the emperor's difficulties on the upper Danube (the Marcomannic Wars) to invade Roman territory."}
{"sequence": "During the late 2nd century, the main ethnic change in the northern Black Sea region was the immigration, from the Vistula valley in the North, of the Goths and accompanying Germanic tribes such as the Taifali and the Hasdingi, a branch of the Vandal people."}
{"sequence": "This migration was part of a series of major population movements in the European \"barbaricum\" (the Roman term for regions outside their empire)."}
{"sequence": "The Goths appear to have established a loose political hegemony over the existing tribes in the region."}
{"sequence": "Under the leadership of the Goths, a series of major invasions of the Roman empire were launched by a grand coalition of lower Danubian tribes from c. 238 onwards."}
{"sequence": "The participation of the Bastarnae in these is likely but largely unspecified, due to Zosimus' and other chroniclers' tendency to lump all these tribes under the general term \"Scythians\" – meaning all the inhabitants of Scythia, rather than the specific Iranic-speaking people called the Scythians."}
{"sequence": "Thus, in 250–251, the Bastarnae were probably involved in the Gothic and Sarmatian invasions which culminated in the Roman defeat at the Battle of Abrittus and the slaying of Emperor Decius (251)."}
{"sequence": "This disaster was the start of the Third Century Crisis of the Roman Empire, a period of military and economic chaos."}
{"sequence": "At this critical moment, the Roman army was crippled by the outbreak of a second smallpox pandemic, the plague of Cyprian (251–70)."}
{"sequence": "The effects are described by Zosimus as even worse than the earlier Antonine plague (166–180), which probably killed 15–30% of the empire's inhabitants."}
{"sequence": "Taking advantage of Roman military disarray, a vast number of barbarian peoples overran much of the empire."}
{"sequence": "The Sarmato-Gothic alliance of the lower Danube carried out major invasions of the Balkans region in 252, and in the periods 253–258 and 260–268."}
{"sequence": "The Peucini Bastarnae are specifically mentioned in the 267/268 invasion, when the coalition built a fleet in the estuary of the river \"Tyras\" (Dniester)."}
{"sequence": "The Peucini Bastarnae would have been critical to this venture since, as coastal and delta dwellers, they would have had seafaring experience that the nomadic Sarmatians and Goths lacked."}
{"sequence": "The barbarians sailed along the Black Sea coast to Tomis in Moesia Inferior, which they tried to take by assault without success."}
{"sequence": "They then attacked the provincial capital Marcianopolis (Devnya, Bulgaria), also in vain."}

{"sequence": "Driven off by Roman forces, the coalition host moved overland into Thracia, where finally it was crushed by Emperor Claudius II (r. 268–270) at Naissus (269)."}
{"sequence": "Claudius II was the first of a sequence of military emperors (the so-called \"Illyrian emperors\" from their main ethnic origin) who restored order in the empire in the late 3rd century."}
{"sequence": "These emperors followed a policy of large-scale resettlement within the empire of defeated barbarian tribes, granting them land in return for an obligation of military service much heavier than the usual conscription quota."}
{"sequence": "The policy had the triple benefit, from the Roman point of view, of weakening the hostile tribe, repopulating the plague-ravaged frontier provinces (bringing their abandoned fields back into cultivation) and providing a pool of first-rate recruits for the army."}
{"sequence": "It could also be popular with the barbarian prisoners, who were often delighted by the prospect of a land grant within the empire."}
{"sequence": "In the 4th century, such communities were known as \"laeti\"."}
{"sequence": "The emperor Probus (r. 276–282) is recorded as resettling 100,000 Bastarnae in Moesia, in addition to other peoples, including Goths, Gepids and Vandals."}
{"sequence": "The Bastarnae are reported to have honoured their oath of allegiance to the emperor, while the other resettled peoples mutinied while Probus was distracted by usurpation attempts and ravaged the Danubian provinces far and wide."}
{"sequence": "A further massive transfer of Bastarnae was carried out by Emperor Diocletian (ruled 284–305) after he and his colleague Galerius defeated a coalition of Bastarnae and Carpi in 299."}
{"sequence": "The remaining transdanubian Bastarnae disappear into historical obscurity in the late empire."}
{"sequence": "Neither of the main ancient sources for this period, Ammianus Marcellinus and Zosimus, mention the Bastarnae in their accounts of the 4th century, possibly implying the loss of their separate identity, presumably assimilated by the regional hegemons, the Goths."}
{"sequence": "Such assimilation would have been facilitated if, as is possible, the Bastarnae spoke an East Germanic language closely related to Gothic."}
{"sequence": "If the Bastarnae remained an identifiable group, it is highly likely that they participated in the vast Gothic-led migration, driven by Hunnic pressure, that was admitted into Moesia by Emperor Valens in 376 and eventually defeated and killed Valens at Adrianople in 378."}
{"sequence": "Although Ammianus refers to the migrants collectively as \"Goths\", he states that, in addition, \"Taifali and other tribes\" were involved."}
{"sequence": "However, after a gap of 150 years, there is a final mention of Bastarnae in the mid-5th century."}
{"sequence": "In 451, the Hunnic leader Attila invaded Gaul with a large army which was ultimately routed at the Battle of Châlons by a Roman-led coalition under the general Aetius."}
{"sequence": "Attila's host, according to Jordanes, included contingents from the \"innumerable tribes that had been brought under his sway\"."}
{"sequence": "This included the Bastarnae, according to the Gallic nobleman Sidonius Apollinaris."}
{"sequence": "However, E.A. Thompson argues that Sidonius' mention of Bastarnae at Chalons is probably false: his purpose was to write a panegyric and not a history, and Sidonius added some spurious names to the list of real participants (e.g. Burgundians, Sciri and Franks) for dramatic effect."}

{"sequence": "After World War I and the establishment of an independent Czechoslovak state, the whole of Bohemia became a part of Czechoslovakia, defying claims of the German speaking inhabitants that regions with German speaking majority should be included in the Republic of German-Austria."}
{"sequence": "Between 1938 and 1945, these border regions were joined to Nazi Germany as the Sudetenland."}
{"sequence": "The remainder of Czech territory became the Second Czechoslovak Republic and was subsequently occupied as the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia."}

{"sequence": "However, the three lands are mentioned in the preamble of the Constitution of the Czech Republic: \"We, citizens of the Czech Republic in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia…\" Bohemia had an area of and today is home to approximately 6.5 million of the Czech Republic's 10.5 million inhabitants."}
{"sequence": "Bohemia was bordered in the south by Upper and Lower Austria (both in Austria), in the west by Bavaria and in the north by Saxony and Lusatia (all in Germany), in the northeast by Silesia (in Poland), and in the east by Moravia (also part of the Czech Republic)."}
{"sequence": "Bohemia's borders were mostly marked by mountain ranges such as the Bohemian Forest, the Ore Mountains, and the Krkonoše, a part of the Sudetes range; the Bohemian-Moravian border roughly follows the Elbe-Danube watershed."}

{"sequence": "The earliest mention was by Tacitus' \"Germania\" 28 (written at the end of the 1st century AD), and later mentions of the same name are in Strabo and Velleius Paterculus."}
{"sequence": "The name appears to include the tribal name \"Boi-\" plus the Germanic element *\"haimaz\" \"home\" (whence Gothic \"haims\", German \"Heimat\", English \"home\"), indicating a Proto-Germanic \"*Bajahaimaz\"."}
{"sequence": "\"Boiohaemum\" was apparently isolated to the area where King Marobod's Kingdom was centred, within the Hercynian forest."}
{"sequence": "Byzantine Emperor Constantine VII in his 10th century work \"De Administrando Imperio\" also mentioned the region as \"Boiki\" (see White Serbia)."}
{"sequence": "The Czech name \"Čechy\" is derived from the name of the Slavic ethnic group, the Czechs, who settled in the area during the 6th or 7th century AD."}
{"sequence": "Bohemia, like neighbouring Bavaria, is named after the Boii, a large Celtic nation known to the Romans for their migrations and settlement in northern Italy and other places."}
{"sequence": "Another part of the nation moved west with the Helvetii into southern France, which was one of the events leading to the interventions of Julius Caesar's Gaulish campaign of 58 BC."}

{"sequence": "In the area of modern Bohemia the Marcomanni and other Suebic groups were led by their king, Marobodus, after they had suffered defeat to Roman forces in Germany."}
{"sequence": "He took advantage of the natural defenses provided by its mountains and forests."}
{"sequence": "They were able to maintain a strong alliance with neighbouring tribes including (at different times) the Lugii, Quadi, Hermunduri, Semnones, and Buri, which was sometimes partly controlled by the Roman Empire and sometimes in conflict with it; for example, in the 2nd century, they fought Marcus Aurelius."}
{"sequence": "In late classical times and the early Middle Ages, two new Suebic groupings appeared to the west of Bohemia in southern Germany, the Alemanni (in the Helvetian desert), and the Bavarians (Baiuvarii)."}
{"sequence": "Many Suebic tribes from the Bohemian region took part in such movements westwards, even settling as far away as Spain and Portugal."}
{"sequence": "With them were also tribes who had pushed from the east, such as the Vandals, and Alans."}
{"sequence": "Other groups pushed southwards towards Pannonia."}

{"sequence": "These are precursors of today's Czechs, but the exact amount of Slavic immigration is a subject of debate."}
{"sequence": "The Slavic influx was divided into two or three waves."}
{"sequence": "The first wave came from the southeast and east, when the Germanic Lombards left Bohemia (c. 568 AD)."}
{"sequence": "Soon after, from the 630s to 660s, the territory was taken by Samo's tribal confederation."}

{"sequence": "The formal independence of Bohemia was further jeopardized when the Bohemian Diet approved administrative reform in 1749."}

{"sequence": "The renewal of the old Bohemian Crown (Kingdom of Bohemia, Margraviate of Moravia, and Duchy of Upper and Lower Silesia) became the official political program of both Czech liberal politicians and the majority of Bohemian aristocracy (\"state rights program\"), while parties representing the German minority and small part of the aristocracy proclaimed their loyalty to the centralistic Constitution (so-called \"Verfassungstreue\")."}

{"sequence": "The last attempt occurred in May 1945 when Czechoslovakia tried to annex the area, whose German speaking majority was being expelled by Polish authorities."}
{"sequence": "The Czech argued that because of the small Czech minority present in the western part of the Kłodzko Valley, which was called the region's \"Czech Corner\" by the German majority, the area should go over to Czechoslovakia instead of being assigned to Poland, as no relevant Polish minority lived in the area."}
{"sequence": "Pressure brought on by the Soviet Union led to a ceasing of military operations, with the Czech minority being expelled to Germany and Czechoslovakia."}

{"sequence": "The BBC claim that they target the 1529 age group, and the average age of its UK audience since 2009 is 30."}
{"sequence": "BBC Radio 1 started 24-hour broadcasting on 1 May 1991."}
{"sequence": "Radio 1 was established in 1967 (along with the more middle of the road BBC Radio 2) as a successor to the BBC Light Programme, which had broadcast popular music and other entertainment since 1945."}
{"sequence": "Radio 1 was conceived as a direct response to the popularity of offshore pirate radio stations such as Radio Caroline and Radio London, which had been outlawed by Act of Parliament."}
{"sequence": "Radio 1 was launched at 7:00am on Saturday 30 September 1967."}
{"sequence": "Broadcasts were on AM (247 metres), using a network of transmitters which had carried the Light Programme."}
{"sequence": "Most were of comparatively low power, at less than 50 kilowatts, leading to patchy coverage of the country."}
{"sequence": "The first disc jockey to broadcast on the new station was Tony Blackburn, whose cheery style, first heard on Radio Caroline and Radio London, won him the prime slot on what became known as the \"Radio 1 Breakfast Show\"."}
{"sequence": "The first words on Radio 1 – after a countdown by the Controller of Radios 1 and 2, Robin Scott, and a jingle, recorded at PAMS in Dallas, Texas, beginning \"The voice of Radio 1\" – were: This was the first use of US-style jingles on BBC radio, but the style was familiar to listeners who were acquainted with Blackburn and other DJs from their days on pirate radio."}
{"sequence": "The reason jingles from PAMS were used was that the Musicians' Union would not agree to a single fee for the singers and musicians if the jingles were made \"in-house\" by the BBC; they wanted repeat fees each time one was played."}
{"sequence": "The first music to be heard on the station was \"Theme One\", specially composed for the launch by George Martin."}
{"sequence": "It was followed by an extract from \"Beefeaters\" by Johnny Dankworth."}
{"sequence": "The first complete record played on Radio 1 was \"Flowers in the Rain\" by The Move, the number 2 record in that week's Top 20 (the number 1 record by Engelbert Humperdink would have been inappropriate for the station's sound)."}
{"sequence": "The second single was \"Massachusetts\" by The Bee Gees."}
{"sequence": "The breakfast show remains the most prized slot in the Radio 1 schedule, with every change of breakfast show presenter generating considerable media interest."}

{"sequence": "Many of the most popular pirate radio voices, such as Simon Dee, had only a one-hour slot per week (\"Midday Spin.\")"}
{"sequence": "Initially, the station was unpopular with some of its target audience who, it is claimed, disliked the fact that much of its airtime was shared with Radio 2 and that it was less unequivocally aimed at a young audience than the offshore stations, with some DJs such as Jimmy Young being in their 40s."}
{"sequence": "The very fact that it was part of an \"establishment\" institution such as the BBC was a turn-off for some, and needle time restrictions prevented it from playing as many records as offshore stations had."}
{"sequence": "It also had limited finances (partly because the BBC did not increase its licence fee to fund the new station) and often, as in January 1975, suffered disproportionately when the BBC had to make financial cutbacks, strengthening an impression that it was regarded as a lower priority by senior BBC executives."}
{"sequence": "Despite this, it gained massive audiences, becoming the most listened-to station in the world with audiences of over 10 million claimed for some of its shows (up to 20 million for some of the combined Radio 1 and Radio 2 shows)."}
{"sequence": "In the early to mid-1970s Radio 1 presenters were rarely out of the British tabloids, thanks to the Publicity Department's high-profile work."}
{"sequence": "The touring summer live broadcasts called the Radio 1 Roadshow – usually as part of the BBC 'Radio Weeks' promotions that took Radio 1, 2 and 4 shows on the road – drew some of the largest crowds of the decade."}
{"sequence": "The station undoubtedly played a role in maintaining the high sales of 45 rpm single records although it benefited from a lack of competition, apart from Radio Luxembourg and Manx Radio in the Isle of Man. ("}
{"sequence": "Independent Local Radio did not begin until October 1973, took many years to cover virtually all of the UK and was initially a mixture of music and talk)."}
{"sequence": "Alan Freeman's \"Saturday Rock Show\" was voted \"Best Radio Show\" five years running by readers of a national music publication, and was then axed by controller Derek Chinnery."}
{"sequence": "Annie Nightingale, whose first Radio 1 program aired on 5 October 1969, was Britain's first national female DJ (the earliest record presenter is thought to be Forces Favourites' Jean Metcalfe but as Metcalfe only presented the programme she is not considered a 'true' DJ) and is now the longest-serving presenter, having constantly evolved her musical tastes with the times."}
{"sequence": "At the start of 1981, Mike Read took over \"The Radio 1 Breakfast Show\" from Dave Lee Travis."}
{"sequence": "Towards the end of the year, Steve Wright started the long-running \"Steve Wright in the Afternoon\" show."}
{"sequence": "In 1982, the new \"Radio 1's Weekend Breakfast Show\" started, initially with Tony Blackburn supported by Maggie Philbin and Keith Chegwin."}
{"sequence": "Adrian John and Pat Sharp also join for the early weekend shows."}
{"sequence": "Gary Davies and Janice Long also join, hosting Saturday night late and evening shows respectively."}
{"sequence": "In 1984, Robbie Vincent joins to host a Sunday evening soul show."}
{"sequence": "With Mike Smith leaves for a while to present on BBC TV's \"Breakfast Time\", Gary Davies then takes over weekday lunchtime slot."}
{"sequence": "Bruno Brookes joins and replaces Peter Powell as presenter of the teatime show, with Powell replacing Blackburn on the weekend breakfast."}
{"sequence": "In 1985, Radio 1 relocated from its studios in Broadcasting House to Egton House."}
{"sequence": "In March 1985, Ranking Miss P becomes the first black female DJ on the station, hosting a reggae programme."}
{"sequence": "In July, Andy Kershaw also joins the station."}
{"sequence": "Simon Mayo joins the station in 1986, whilst Smith rejoins to replace Read on the breakfast show."}
{"sequence": "In response to the growth in dance and rap music, Jeff Young joins in October 1987 with the Big Beat show."}
{"sequence": "At the end of the year, Nicky Campbell, Mark Goodier, and Liz Kershaw all join and Janice Long leaves."}
{"sequence": "Mayo replaces Smith on the breakfast show in May 1988."}
{"sequence": "In September, Goodier and Kershaw take over weekend breakfasts with Powell departing."}
{"sequence": "Campbell takes over weekdays."}
{"sequence": "From September 1988, Radio 1 begins its FM switch-on, with further rollout across the country through 1989."}
{"sequence": "In 1992, Radio 1, for the first and only time, covered a general election."}
{"sequence": "Their coverage was presented by Nicky Campbell."}
{"sequence": "In his last few months as controller, Johnny Beerling commissioned a handful of new shows that in some ways set the tone for what was to come under Matthew Bannister."}
{"sequence": "One of these \"Loud'n'proud\" was the UK's first national radio series aimed at a gay audience (made in Manchester and was aired from August 1993)."}
{"sequence": "Far from being a parting quirk, the show was a surprise hit and led to the network's first coverage of the large outdoor Gay Pride event in 1994."}
{"sequence": "Bannister took the reins fully in October 1993."}
{"sequence": "His aim was to rid the station of its 'Smashie and Nicey' image and make it appeal to the under 25s."}
{"sequence": "Although originally launched as a youth station, by the early 1990s, its loyal listeners (and DJs) had aged with the station over its 25-year history."}
{"sequence": "Many long-standing DJs, such as Simon Bates, Dave Lee Travis, Alan Freeman, Bob Harris, Paul Gambaccini, Gary Davies, and later Steve Wright, Bruno Brookes and Johnnie Walker left the station or were dismissed, and in January 1995 old music (typically anything recorded before 1990) was dropped from the daytime playlist."}
{"sequence": "Many listeners rebelled as the first new DJs to be introduced represented a crossover from other parts of the BBC (notably Bannister and Trevor Dann's former colleagues at the BBC's London station, GLR) with Emma Freud and Danny Baker."}
{"sequence": "Another problem was that, at the time, Radio 2 was sticking resolutely to a format which appealed mainly to those who had been listening since the days of the Light Programme, and commercial radio, which was targeting the \"Radio 1 and a half\" audience, consequently enjoyed a massive increase in its audience share at the expense of Radio 1."}
{"sequence": "After the departure of Steve Wright, who had been unsuccessfully moved from his long-running afternoon show to the breakfast show in January 1994, Bannister hired Chris Evans to present the prime morning slot in April 1995."}
{"sequence": "Evans was a popular presenter who was eventually dismissed in 1997 after he demanded to present the breakfast show for only four days per week."}
{"sequence": "Evans was replaced from 17 February 1997 by Mark and Lard – Mark Radcliffe (along with his sidekick Marc Riley), who found the slick, mass-audience style required for a breakfast show did not come naturally to them."}
{"sequence": "They were replaced by Zoe Ball and Kevin Greening eight months later in October 1997, with Greening moving on and leaving Ball as solo presenter."}
{"sequence": "The reinvention of the station happened at a fortuitous time, with the rise of Britpop in the mid-90s – bands like Oasis, Blur and Pulp were popular and credible at the time and the station's popularity rose with them."}
{"sequence": "Documentaries like John Peel's \"Lost in Music\" which looked at the influence that the use of drugs have had over popular musicians received critical acclaim but were slated inside Broadcasting House."}
{"sequence": "Later in the 1990s the Britpop boom declined, and manufactured chart pop (boy bands and acts aimed at sub-teenagers) came to dominate the charts."}
{"sequence": "New-genre music occupied the evenings (indie on weekdays and dance at weekends), with a mix of specialist shows and playlist fillers through late nights."}
{"sequence": "The rise of rave culture through the late 1980s and early 1990s gave the station the opportunity to move into a controversial and youth-orientated movement by bringing in club DJ Pete Tong amongst others."}
{"sequence": "There had been a dance music programme on Radio 1 since 1987 and Pete Tong was the second DJ to present an all dance music show."}
{"sequence": "This quickly gave birth to the Essential Mix where underground DJs mix electronic and club based music in a two-hour slot."}
{"sequence": "Dance music has been a permanent feature on Radio 1 since with club DJs such as Judge Jules, Danny Rampling and Seb Fontaine all having shows as well as Radio 1 hosting an annual weekend in Ibiza."}
{"sequence": "Listening numbers continued to decline but the station succeeded in targeting a younger age-group and more cross gender groups."}
{"sequence": "Eventually, this change in content was reflected by a rise in audience that is continuing to this day."}
{"sequence": "Notably, the station has received praise for shows such as The Surgery, Bobby Friction and Nihal's show, \"The Evening Session\" and its successor Zane Lowe's show."}
{"sequence": "Its website has also been well received."}
{"sequence": "However, the breakfast show and the UK Top 40 continued to struggle."}
{"sequence": "In 2000, Zoe Ball was replaced in the mornings by close friend and fellow ladette Sara Cox, but, despite heavy promotion, listening figures for the breakfast show continued to fall."}
{"sequence": "In 2004 Cox was replaced by Chris Moyles."}
{"sequence": "The newly rebranded breakfast show was known as The Chris Moyles Show and it increased its audience, ahead of The Today Programme on Radio 4 as the second most popular breakfast show (after The Chris Evans Breakfast Show hosted by Chris Evans)."}
{"sequence": "Moyles continued to use innovative ways to try to tempt listeners from the \"Wake Up to Wogan\" show."}
{"sequence": "In 2006, for example, creating a \"SAY NO TO WOGAN\" campaign live on-air."}
{"sequence": "This angered the BBC hierarchy, though the row simmered down when it was clear that the 'campaign' had totally failed to alter the listening trends of the time – Wogan still increased figures at a faster rate than Moyles."}
{"sequence": "The chart show's ratings fell after the departure of long-time host Mark Goodier, amid falling single sales in the UK."}
{"sequence": "Ratings for the show fell in 2002 whilst Goodier was still presenting the show, meaning that commercial radio's Network Chart overtook it in the ratings for the first time."}
{"sequence": "However, the BBC denied he was being sacked."}
{"sequence": "Before July 2015, when the chart release day was changed to Friday, the BBC show competed with networked commercial radio's The Big Top 40 Show which was broadcast at the same time."}
{"sequence": "Many DJs either ousted by Bannister or who left during his tenure (such as Johnnie Walker, Bob Harris and Steve Wright) have joined Radio 2 which has now overtaken Radio 1 as the UK's most popular radio station, using a style that Radio 1 had until the early 1990s."}
{"sequence": "The success of Moyles' show has come alongside increased success for the station in general."}
{"sequence": "In 2006, DJs Chris Moyles, Scott Mills and Zane Lowe all won gold Sony Radio Awards, while the station itself came away with the best station award."}
{"sequence": "A new evening schedule was introduced in September 2006, dividing the week by genre."}
{"sequence": "Monday was mainly pop-funkrock-oriented, Tuesday was R&B and hip-hop, Thursdays and Fridays were primarily dance, with specialist R&B and reggae shows."}
{"sequence": "Following the death of John Peel in October 2004, Annie Nightingale is now the longest serving presenter, having worked there since 1970."}
{"sequence": "The licence-fee funding of Radio 1, alongside Radio 2, is often criticised by the commercial sector."}
{"sequence": "In the first quarter of 2011 Radio 1 was part of an efficiency review conducted by John Myers."}
{"sequence": "His role, according to Andrew Harrison, the chief executive of RadioCentre, was \"to identify both areas of best practice and possible savings.\""}
{"sequence": "The controller of Radio 1 and sister station 1Xtra changed to Ben Cooper on 28 October 2011, following the departure of Andy Parfitt."}
{"sequence": "Ben Cooper answered to the Director of BBC Audio and Music, Tim Davie."}
{"sequence": "On 7 December 2011, Ben Cooper's first major changes to the station were announced."}

{"sequence": "In September 2012, Nick Grimshaw replaced Chris Moyles as host of \"Radio 1's Breakfast Show\"."}
{"sequence": "Grimshaw previously hosted Mon-Thurs 10pm-Midnight, Weekend Breakfast and Sunday evenings alongside Annie Mac."}
{"sequence": "Grimshaw was replaced by Phil Taggart and Alice Levine on the 10pm-Midnight show."}

{"sequence": "It was announced that Radio 1 Dance will launch on Friday 9th October 2020 with Annie Mac and Danny Howard kicking the station off from 6 pm."}
{"sequence": "The station is broadcast exclusively on BBC Sounds."}
{"sequence": "From inception for over 20 years, Radio 1 broadcast from an adjacent pair of continuity suites (originally Con A and Con B) in the main control room of Broadcasting House."}
{"sequence": "These cons were configured to allow DJs to operate the equipment themselves and play their own records and jingle cartridges (called self-op)."}
{"sequence": "This was a departure from traditional BBC practice, where a studio manager would play in discs from the studio control cubicle."}
{"sequence": "Due to needle time restrictions, much of the music was played from tapes of BBC session recordings."}
{"sequence": "The DJs were assisted by one or more technical operators (TOs) who would set up tapes and control sound levels during broadcasts."}
{"sequence": "In 1985, Radio 1 moved across the road from Broadcasting House to Egton House."}
{"sequence": "The station moved to Yalding House in 1996, and Egton House was demolished in 2003 to make way for extension to Broadcasting House."}
{"sequence": "This extension would eventually be renamed the Egton Wing, and then the Peel Wing."}
{"sequence": "Until recently, the studios were located in the basement of Yalding House (near to BBC Broadcasting House) which is on Great Portland Street in central London."}
{"sequence": "They used to broadcast from two main studios in the basement; Y2 and Y3 (there is also a smaller studio, YP1, used mainly for production)."}
{"sequence": "These two main studios (Y2 and Y3) are separated by the \"Live Lounge\", although it is mainly used as an office; there are rarely live sets recorded from it, as Maida Vale Studios is used instead for larger set-ups."}
{"sequence": "The studios are linked by webcams and windows through the \"Live Lounge\", allowing DJs to see each other when changing between shows."}
{"sequence": "Y2 is the studio from where \"The Chris Moyles Show\" was broadcast and is also the studio rigged with static cameras for when the station broadcasts on the \"Live Cam\"."}
{"sequence": "The station moved there in 1996 from Egton House."}
{"sequence": "In December 2012, Radio 1 moved from Yalding House to new studios on the 8th floor of the new BBC Broadcasting House, Portland Place, just a few metres away from the \"Peel Wing\", formerly the \"Egton Wing\", which occupies the land on which Egton House previously stood: it was renamed the \"Peel Wing\" in 2012 in honour of the long-serving BBC Radio 1 presenter, John Peel, who broadcast on the station from its launch in 1967 up until his death in 2004."}
{"sequence": "Programmes have also regularly been broadcast from other regions, notably \"The Mark and Lard Show\", broadcast every weekday from New Broadcasting House, Oxford Road, Manchester for over a decade (October 1993 – March 2004) – the longest regular broadcast on the network from outside the capital."}
{"sequence": "Radio 1 originally broadcast on AM (or 247 metres)."}
{"sequence": "On 23 November 1978, the station was moved to and (275 and 285 m), but did not begin broadcasting on its own FM frequencies until late 1987."}
{"sequence": "The BBC had been allocated three FM frequency ranges in 1955, for the then Light Programme (now BBC Radio 2), Third Programme (now BBC Radio 3) and Home Service (now BBC Radio 4) stations."}
{"sequence": "Thus when Radio 1 was launched, there was no FM frequency range allocated for the station, the official reason being that there was no space, even though no commercial stations had yet launched on FM."}
{"sequence": "Because of this, from launch until the end of the 1980s Radio 1 was allowed to take over Radio 2's FM transmitters for a few hours per week."}
{"sequence": "These were Saturday afternoons, Sunday teatime and evening – most notably for the Top 40 Singles Chart on Sunday afternoons; 10pm to midnight on weeknights including Sounds of the Seventies until 1975, and thereafter the John Peel show (Mon–Thurs) and the Friday Rock Show; and most Bank Holiday afternoons, when Radio 2 was broadcasting a Bank Holiday edition of Sport on 2."}
{"sequence": "A year later the FM frequencies became national after the police communication allocation changed, freeing up what is known today as 97–99 FM, which the BBC acquired."}
{"sequence": "The rollout of Radio 1 on FM began on 1 September 1988, starting with Central Scotland, the Midlands and the north of England."}
{"sequence": "A month later, to coincide with an extension of broadcast hours, Radio 1 stopped broadcasting on Radio 2's FM frequencies on weeknights and on Sunday evenings and by 1990 all usage of Radio 2's FM frequencies had ended."}
{"sequence": "Radio 1 made great efforts to promote its new FM service, renaming itself on-air initially to 'Radio 1 FM' and later as '1FM' until 1995."}
{"sequence": "The engineering programme was initially completed in 1995."}
{"sequence": "The Conservative government decided to increase competition on AM and disallowed the simulcasting of services on both AM and FM, affecting both BBC and Independent Local Radio."}
{"sequence": "Radio 1's medium wave frequencies were reallocated to Independent National Radio."}
{"sequence": "Radio 1's last broadcast on MW was on 1 July 1994, with Stephen Duffy's \"Kiss Me\" being the last record played on MW just before 9am."}
{"sequence": "For those who continued to listen, just after 9am, Radio 1 jingles were played in reverse chronological order ending with its first jingle from 30 September 1967."}
{"sequence": "In the initial months after this closure a pre-recorded message with Mark Goodier was played to warn listeners that Radio 1 was now an \"FM-only\" station."}
{"sequence": "Around this time, Radio 1 began broadcasting on spare audio subcarriers on Sky Television's analogue satellite service, initially in mono (on UK Gold) and later in stereo (on UK Living)."}
{"sequence": "The BBC launched its national radio stations on DAB digital radio in 1995, however the technology was expensive at the time and so was not marketed, instead used as a test for future technologies."}
{"sequence": "DAB was \"officially\" launched in 2002 as sets became cheaper."}

{"sequence": "In July 2005, Sirius Satellite Radio began simulcasting Radio 1 across the United States as channel 11 on its own service and channel 6011 on Dish Network satellite TV."}
{"sequence": "Sirius Canada began simulcasting Radio 1 when it was launched on 1 December 2005 (also on channel 11)."}
{"sequence": "The Sirius simulcasts were time shifted five hours to allow US and Canadian listeners in the Eastern Time Zone to hear Radio 1 at the same time of day as UK listeners."}
{"sequence": "On 12 November 2008, Radio 1 made its debut on XM Satellite Radio in both the US and Canada on channel 29, moving to XM 15 and Sirius 15 on 4 May 2011."}

{"sequence": "We will keep you posted."}
{"sequence": "Thousands of angry Sirius XM customers began a campaign on Facebook and other social media to reinstate BBC Radio 1 on Sirius XM Radio."}

{"sequence": "On 19 August 2014, SiriusXM again stopped carrying BBC Radio 1 programming with no advanced notice."}
{"sequence": "The stream is no longer available on the Internet Radio platform."}
{"sequence": "From 1999 until 2012, Radio 1 split the home nations for localised programming in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, to allow the broadcast of a showcase programme for regional talent."}
{"sequence": "Most recently, these shows were under the BBC Introducing brand."}
{"sequence": "Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland had their own shows, which were broadcast on a 3-week rotational basis in England."}
{"sequence": "From January 2011 until June 2012, Scotland's show was presented by Ally McCrae."}
{"sequence": "Previously it was hosted by Vic Galloway (who also presents for BBC Radio Scotland); who had presented the show solo since 2004, after his original co-host Gill Mills departed."}
{"sequence": "Wales's show was hosted by Jen Long between January 2011 until May 2012."}
{"sequence": "Previously Bethan Elfyn occupied the slot, who had at one time hosted alongside Huw Stephens, until Stephens left to join the national network, although he still broadcasts a show for Wales – a Welsh-language music show on BBC Radio Cymru on Thursday evenings."}
{"sequence": "Phil Taggart presented the Northern Ireland programme between November 2011 and May 2012."}
{"sequence": "The show was formerly presented by Rory McConnell."}
{"sequence": "Before joining the national network, Colin Murray was a presenter on \"The Session\" in Northern Ireland, along with Donna Legge; after Murray's promotion to the network Legge hosted alone for a time, and on her departure McConnell took her place."}
{"sequence": "The regional opt-outs originally went out from 8pm to 10pm on Thursdays (the \"Evening Session\"s time slot) and were known as the \"Session in the Nations\" (the \"Session\" tag was later dropped due to the demise of the \"Evening Session\"); they later moved to run from 7:30pm to 9pm, with the first half-hour of Zane Lowe's programme going out across the whole of the UK."}
{"sequence": "On 18 October 2007 the regional programmes moved to a Wednesday night/Thursday morning slot from midnight to 2am under the \"BBC Introducing\" banner, allowing Lowe's Thursday show to be aired across the network; prior to this change Huw Stephens had presented the Wednesday midnight show nationally."}
{"sequence": "In January 2011, BBC Introducing was moved to the new time slot of midnight to 2am on Monday mornings, and the Scottish and Welsh shows were given new presenters in the form of Ally McCrae and Jen Long."}
{"sequence": "The opt-outs were only available to listeners on the FM frequencies."}
{"sequence": "Because of the way the DAB and digital TV services of Radio 1 are broadcast (a single-frequency network on DAB and a single broadcast feed of Radio 1 on TV platforms), the digital version of the station was not regionalised."}
{"sequence": "The BBC Trust announced in May 2012 that the regional music programmes on Radio 1 would be replaced with a single programme offering a UK-wide platform for new music as part of a series of cost-cutting measures across the BBC."}
{"sequence": "In June 2012, the regional shows ended and were replaced by a single \"BBC Introducing\" show presented by Jen Long and Ally McCrae."}
{"sequence": "Because of its youth-orientated nature, Radio 1 plays a broad mix of current and potential future hits, including independent/alternative, hip hop, rock, dance/electronica and pop."}
{"sequence": "This made the station stand out from other top 40 stations, both in the UK and across the world."}
{"sequence": "Due to restrictions on the amount of commercial music that could be played on radio in the UK until 1988 (the \"needle time\" limitation) the station has recorded many live performances."}
{"sequence": "Studio sessions (recordings of about four tracks made in a single day), also supplemented the live music content, many of them finding their way to commercially available LPs and CDs."}
{"sequence": "The sessions recorded for John Peel's late night programme are particularly renowned."}
{"sequence": "The station also broadcasts documentaries and interviews."}
{"sequence": "Although this type of programming arose from necessity it has given the station diversity."}
{"sequence": "The needletime restrictions meant the station tended to have a higher level of speech by DJs."}
{"sequence": "While the station is often criticised for \"waffling\" by presenters, an experimental \"more music day\" in 1988 was declared a failure after only a third of callers favoured it."}
{"sequence": "Radio 1 has a public service broadcasting obligation to provide news, which it fulfills through Newsbeat bulletins throughout the day."}
{"sequence": "Shared with 1Xtra and Asian Network, short news summaries are provided roughly hourly on the half-hour during daytime hours with two additional 15-minute bulletins at select times."}

{"sequence": "It was announced in 2013 that Radio 1 had submitted plans to launch its own dedicated video channel on the BBC iPlayer where videos of live performances as well as some features and shows would be streamed in a central location."}
{"sequence": "Plans were approved by the BBC Trust in November 2014 and the channel launched on 10 November 2014."}
{"sequence": "Radio 1 provides alternative programming on some Bank Holidays."}
{"sequence": "Programmes have included 'The 10 Hour Takeover', a request-based special, in which the DJs on air would encourage listeners to select any available track to play, 'One Hit Wonder Day' and 'The Chart of the Decade' where the 150 biggest selling singles in the last 10 years were counted down and played in full."}
{"sequence": "On Sunday 30 September 2007, Radio 1 celebrated its 40th birthday."}

{"sequence": "On 18 March 2011, BBC's Radio 1 longest-serving breakfast DJ Chris Moyles and sidekick Dave Vitty broadcast for 52 hours as part of a Guinness World Record attempt, in aid of Comic Relief."}
{"sequence": "The pair stayed on air for 52 hours in total setting a new world record for 'Radio DJ Endurance Marathon (Team)' after already breaking Simon Mayo's 12-year record for Radio 1's Longest Show of 37 hours which he set in 1999, also for Comic Relief."}
{"sequence": "The presenters started on 16 March 2011 and came off air at 10:30am on 18 March 2011."}
{"sequence": "During this Fearne Cotton made a bet with DJ Chris Moyles that if they raise over £2,000,000 she will appear on the show in a swimsuit."}
{"sequence": "After passing the £2,000,000 mark, Cotton appeared on the studio webcam in a stripy monochrome swimsuit."}
{"sequence": "The appearance of Cotton between 10:10am and 10:30am caused the Radio 1 website to crash due to a high volume of traffic."}
{"sequence": "In total the event raised £2,622,421 for Comic Relief."}
{"sequence": "In 1981, Radio 1 broadcast a radio adaptation of the space opera film, \"Star Wars\"."}
{"sequence": "The 13-episode serial was adapted for radio by the author Brian Daley and directed by John Madden, and was a co-production between the BBC and the American Broadcaster NPR."}

{"sequence": "The Radio 1 Roadshow, which usually involved Radio 1 DJs and pop stars travelling around popular UK seaside destinations, began in 1973, hosted by Alan Freeman in Newquay, Cornwall, with the final one held at Heaton Park, Manchester in 1999."}
{"sequence": "Although the Roadshow attracted large crowds and the style changed with the style of the station itself—such as the introduction of whistlestop audio postcards of each location in 1994 (\"2minuteTour\")—they were still rooted in the older style of the station, and therefore fit for retirement."}
{"sequence": "In March 2000, Radio 1 decided to change the Roadshow format, renaming it \"One Big Sunday\" in the process."}
{"sequence": "Several of these \"Sundays\" were held in large city-centre parks."}
{"sequence": "In 2003, the event changed again and was rebranded \"One Big Weekend\", with each event occurring biannually and covering two days."}
{"sequence": "Under this name, it visited Derry in Northern Ireland, as part of the \"Music Lives\" campaign, and Perry Park in Birmingham."}
{"sequence": "The most recent change occurred in 2005 when the event was yet again renamed and the decision taken to hold only one per year, this time as Radio 1's Big Weekend."}
{"sequence": "Venues under this title have included Herrington Country Park, Camperdown Country Park, Moor Park–which was the first \"Weekend\" to feature a third stage–Mote Park, Lydiard Park, Bangor and Carlisle Airport."}

{"sequence": "The event was opened on the Friday with a dance set in George Square, featuring Radio 1 Dance DJs such as Danny Howard and Pete Tong, and other well-known acts such as Martin Garrix and Tiesto."}
{"sequence": "In 2015, the event was held in Norwich and featured performances from the likes of Taylor Swift, Muse, David Guetta, Years & Years and others."}
{"sequence": "2016 saw the event make its way to Exeter."}
{"sequence": "It was headlined by Coldplay, who closed the weekend on the Sunday evening."}
{"sequence": "The event was in Hull in 2017 and saw performances by artists such as Zara Larsson, Shawn Mendes, Stormzy, Katy Perry, Little Mix, Sean Paul, Rita Ora, The Chainsmokers, Clean Bandit and Kings of Leon."}
{"sequence": "To take advantage of Glastonbury Festival's fallow year in 2018, 4 separate Big Weekends were held simultaneously between 25 and 28 May.

{"sequence": "BBC Red Button BBC Red Button is a branding used for digital interactive television services provided by the BBC, and broadcast in the United Kingdom."}
{"sequence": "The services replaced Ceefax, the BBC's analogue teletext service."}
{"sequence": "BBC Red Button's text services were due to close on 30 January 2020, but the switch off was suspended on 29 January 2020 following protests."}
{"sequence": "The service was launched in September 1999 as BBC Text."}
{"sequence": "It was relaunched in November 2001 under the BBCi brand and operated under this name until late 2008, when it was rebranded as BBC Red Button."}
{"sequence": "The \"red button\" name refers to the common interface on remote controls for digital televisions and set-top boxes, a red push-button which launches digital teletext services."}
{"sequence": "Although initially marketed as a spectacular new form of television, by 2008 this had given way to positioning iTV as 'everyday'."}
{"sequence": "This was due in part to the institutional landscape of television in the UK."}
{"sequence": "In September 2009, the BBC celebrated 10 years of the digital interactive TV service."}
{"sequence": "BBC Text originally launched on digital terrestrial services in September 1999, and was later introduced on satellite and cable platforms."}
{"sequence": "In the first phase, the service was created using content migrated from the existing analogue teletext service, Ceefax."}
{"sequence": "A digital text service had been available since the launch of digital terrestrial television in November 1998, but the BBC Text service was not publicly launched until November 1999, due to a lack of availability of compatible set-top boxes."}
{"sequence": "BBC Text was considerably more advanced than Ceefax, in that it offered a richer visual interface, with the possibility of photographic images and designed graphics (as opposed to Ceefax graphics which were composed of simple blocks of colour)."}
{"sequence": "BBC Text also enabled channel association, the ability for the user to retain their selected television channel visible in one section of the screen whilst viewing the text service, in contrast to Ceefax, which could only be viewed as a full-screen display, or as a semitransparent overlay (i.e. opaque blocks of colour on top of the television channel, with the black background now transparent; not 'translucent blocks of colour with a translucent black background') above the television picture."}
{"sequence": "The original text service had no return path, this being made available in later phases."}
{"sequence": "BBC Text pioneered an early form of \"on-demand\" interactive television, called Enhanced TV."}
{"sequence": "During the 1999 Wimbledon Championships, the BBC presented a service which allowed viewers to select a video stream of different matches, and access additional information such as player profiles, scores and interactive quizzes."}
{"sequence": "Although the experimental service was publicly available, there were no digital set-top boxes or receivers available on the market which could decode the signal and the service was only presented to the public via BBC demonstrations using prototype receivers."}
{"sequence": "The BBCi brand launched in November 2001 and was conceived as a cohesive multi-platform brand name for all the BBC's digital interactive services, encompassing the corporation's digital teletext, interactive television and website services."}
{"sequence": "According to the BBC, the \"i\" in BBCi stood for \"interactivity\" as well as \"innovation\"."}
{"sequence": "The various services all took on a common interface device, an \"i-bar\" branded with the BBCi logo, which sought to emphasise the brand across different technologies by providing similar navigation."}
{"sequence": "For example, the BBC website, which had previously been called BBC Online, took on the BBCi brand from 2001, displaying an i-bar across the top of every page, offering a category-based navigation: Categories, TV, Radio, Communicate, Where I Live, A-Z Index, and a search."}
{"sequence": "Similarly, BBC interactive television services all offered a horizontal i-bar along the bottom of television screens, with four colour-coded interactions linked to the four colour buttons on TV remote controls."}
{"sequence": "After three years of consistent use across different platforms, the BBC began to drop the BBCi brand gradually; on 6 May 2004, the BBC website was renamed bbc.co.uk, after the main URL used to access the site."}
{"sequence": "Interactive TV services continued under the BBCi brand until late 2008."}
{"sequence": "Today, the broadcaster's online video player, the BBC iPlayer, reflects the branding legacy by retaining an i-prefix in its branding."}
{"sequence": "In June 2013, a HD version of BBC Red Button was launched for the summertime."}
{"sequence": "It closed on 25 November 2013 after the 50 anniversary of Doctor Who."}
{"sequence": "It returned each year along with the other BBC Red Button channels as a temporary channel for the duration of the Wimbledon tennis tournament."}
{"sequence": "On 26 March 2018, CBBC HD began its downtime and the relaunch of BBC Red Button HD took place to cover the 2018 Commonwealth Games."}
{"sequence": "It was added on Sky on channel 981 and Freeview channel 602 on 3 April 2018 and closed on 16 April 2018 after the Games had concluded."}
{"sequence": "From 2008, the BBC gradually began to drop the BBCi name from its digital interactive TV services also, replacing it with the name BBC Red Button."}
{"sequence": "The BBCi logo continued in on-screen presentation for some time."}
{"sequence": "BBC Connected Red Button launched in December 2012 on Virgin TiVo and on some Freeview and Freesat 'Smart TVs' in December 2013."}
{"sequence": "The service is a composite IP and broadcast service and may be the future of Red Button on internet connected televisions."}
{"sequence": "The service was renamed BBC Red Button+ in April 2015."}
{"sequence": "It launched with an updated brand."}
{"sequence": "After nearly 21 years of service, the BBC announced in 2019 that due to financial cuts, the text services on Red Button on all platforms would be removed from 30 January 2020."}
{"sequence": "The video services, used during events like Wimbledon and the Olympic Games, however, would continue."}
{"sequence": "On 29 January 2020, the BBC announced their suspension of the switch-off due to protests, one day before the service was due to have started being phased out."}
{"sequence": "This announcement comes following a petition, organised by the National Federation of the Blind of the UK (NFBUK), which was submitted to the BBC and Downing Street."}
{"sequence": "The petition expresses NFBUK's concerns with the switch-off, citing that the service is \"vital for visually impaired, deaf, disabled and older people, as well as many other people who want to find out information independently in an easy, convenient and accessible format, who are not online.\""}
{"sequence": "They're concerned that the withdrawal of the service would leave many already vulnerable people into further isolation and marginalisation from society."}
{"sequence": "NFBUK states they cannot understand how the BBC can meet their obligations set in the Royal Charter following the cut of the Red Button Teletext service."}
{"sequence": "BBC Red Button is available on all digital television platforms in the UK, including digital cable through Virgin Media, digital satellite through Sky and Freesat and digital terrestrial television through Freeview."}
{"sequence": "It is also available in Ireland through Sky."}
{"sequence": "On Freeview interactivity does not permit users to submit data (such as answering questions in a quiz or requesting video on demand), as the platform does not provide a return path."}
{"sequence": "BBC Red Button currently provides one video stream to all platforms, which can be accessed directly from Freeview channel 601, Freesat channel 981, Sky channel 980 and Virgin Media channel 991, however the feed is standard definition only."}
{"sequence": "One advantage of the feed is the DVR ability as the conventional Red Button interaction restricts DVR record / pause / rewind functions, and is a major caveat for many."}
{"sequence": "It is currently unknown if the BBC plans to re-introduce a permanent high-definition service of the direct channel feed, but until they do, viewers will continue to move to rival satellite services for high-definition broadcasts of live sporting events such as tennis, cycling and snooker."}
{"sequence": "The BBC does have the ability to increase the amount of streams during major events and has done so on numerous occasions, as follows: Generally, BBC Red Button offers text and video based services, as well as enhanced television programmes which offer extra information, video or quizzes."}
{"sequence": "In September 2005, BBCi launched an update to the interactivity available from the BBC's Radio channels on Freeview."}
{"sequence": "Originally only Radiotext was available."}
{"sequence": "After the update, users could access information about the programme, schedules, news, sport and weather."}
{"sequence": "From 2005, Freeview users could access the CBBC Extra video stream."}
{"sequence": "The same team behind the BBC's digital text service also launched the early incarnations of the BBC's Interactive Wimbledon and Interactive Open Golf services in 2000, which were awarded an Interactive BAFTA that year."}
{"sequence": "The News Multiscreen was removed from the digital service in October 2009, to make room for future Freeview HD broadcasts."}
{"sequence": "Here is a table of the contents of the BBC Red Button as of February 2020: The service was initially compatible with ONdigital and ITV Digital boxes, though loading speeds were slower than newer Freeview boxes."}
{"sequence": "Page numbers were introduced in 2004 to aid navigation, with 3-digit page numbers matching with those of the analogue Ceefax in 2006."}
{"sequence": "Pages exclusive to digital are given a four digit number."}
{"sequence": "An index navigation screen was also introduced, replacing the previous BBCi Menu."}
{"sequence": "The Teletext service from the UK commercial broadcasters had stopped supporting the old boxes in 2005."}
{"sequence": "As of 2010, the ONdigital boxes only load pages 100 and 199 and some interactive services that use channel 301, if any other page is loaded it exits the service."}
{"sequence": "Usage of these boxes dwindled further as technology developed."}
{"sequence": "They used \"original\" technology and as such were not upgradable."}
{"sequence": "Following each regional changeover to full digital TV broadcasting, the remaining units are no longer of use, as they do not support the \"8K-mode\" for DVB-T introduced across the UK as part of the digital switchover."}
{"sequence": "Backplane A backplane (or \"backplane system\") is a group of electrical connectors in parallel with each other, so that each pin of each connector is linked to the same relative pin of all the other connectors, forming a computer bus."}
{"sequence": "It is used as a backbone to connect several printed circuit boards together to make up a complete computer system."}
{"sequence": "Backplanes commonly use a printed circuit board, but wire-wrapped backplanes have also been used in minicomputers and high-reliability applications."}
{"sequence": "A backplane is generally differentiated from a motherboard by the lack of on-board processing and storage elements."}
{"sequence": "A backplane uses plug-in cards for storage and processing."}
{"sequence": "Early microcomputer systems like the Altair 8800 used a backplane for the processor and expansion cards."}
{"sequence": "Backplanes are normally used in preference to cables because of their greater reliability."}
{"sequence": "In a cabled system, the cables need to be flexed every time that a card is added or removed from the system; this flexing eventually causes mechanical failures."}
{"sequence": "A backplane does not suffer from this problem, so its service life is limited only by the longevity of its connectors."}
{"sequence": "For example, DIN 41612 connectors (used in the VMEbus system) have three durability grades built to withstand (respectively) 50, 400 and 500 insertions and removals, or \"mating cycles\"."}
{"sequence": "To transmit information, Serial Back-Plane technology uses a low-voltage differential signaling transmission method for sending information."}
{"sequence": "In addition, there are bus expansion cables which will extend a computer bus to an external backplane, usually located in an enclosure, to provide more or different slots than the host computer provides."}
{"sequence": "These cable sets have a transmitter board located in the computer, an expansion board in the remote backplane, and a cable between the two."}
{"sequence": "Backplanes have grown in complexity from the simple Industry Standard Architecture (ISA) (used in the original IBM PC) or S-100 style where all the connectors were connected to a common bus."}
{"sequence": "Due to limitations inherent in the Peripheral Component Interconnect (PCI) specification for driving slots, backplanes are now offered as passive and active."}
{"sequence": "True passive backplanes offer no active bus driving circuitry."}
{"sequence": "Any desired arbitration logic is placed on the daughter cards."}
{"sequence": "Active backplanes include chips which buffer the various signals to the slots."}
{"sequence": "Common myth around passive backplane, even if it \"is\" single, is not usually considered a SPOF."}
{"sequence": "Active back-planes are even more complicated and thus have a non-zero risk of malfunction."}
{"sequence": "However one situation that can cause disruption both in the case of Active and Passive Back-planes is while performing maintenance activities i.e. while swapping boards there is always a possibility of damaging the Pins/Connectors on the Back-plane, this may cause full outage for the system as all boards mounted on the back-plane should be removed in order to fix the system."}
{"sequence": "Therefore, we are seeing newer architectures where systems use high speed redundant connectivity to interconnect system boards point to point with No Single Point of Failure anywhere in the system."}
{"sequence": "When a backplane is used with a plug-in single board computer (SBC) or system host board (SHB), the combination provides the same functionality as a motherboard, providing processing power, memory, I/O and slots for plug-in cards."}
{"sequence": "While there are a few motherboards that offer more than 8 slots, that is the traditional limit."}
{"sequence": "In addition, as technology progresses, the availability and number of a particular slot type may be limited in terms of what is currently offered by motherboard manufacturers."}
{"sequence": "However, backplane architecture is somewhat unrelated to the SBC technology plugged into it."}
{"sequence": "There are some limitations to what can be constructed, in that the SBC chip set and processor have to provide the capability of supporting the slot types."}
{"sequence": "In addition, virtually an unlimited number of slots can be provided with 20, including the SBC slot, as a practical though not an absolute limit."}
{"sequence": "Thus, a PICMG backplane can provide any number and any mix of ISA, PCI, PCI-X, and PCI-e slots, limited only by the ability of the SBC to interface to and drive those slots."}
{"sequence": "For example, an SBC with the latest i7 processor could interface with a backplane providing up to 19 ISA slots to drive legacy I/O cards."}
{"sequence": "Some backplanes are constructed with slots for connecting to devices on both sides, and are referred to as midplanes."}
{"sequence": "This ability to plug cards into either side of a midplane is often useful in larger systems made up primarily of modules attached to the midplane."}
{"sequence": "Midplanes are often used in computers, mostly in blade servers, where server blades reside on one side and the peripheral (power, networking, and other I/O) and service modules reside on the other."}
{"sequence": "Midplanes are also popular in networking and telecommunications equipment where one side of the chassis accepts system processing cards and the other side of the chassis accepts network interface cards."}
{"sequence": "Orthogonal midplanes connect vertical cards on one side to horizontal boards on the other side."}
{"sequence": "One common orthogonal midplane connects many vertical telephone line cards on one side, each one connected to copper telephone wires, to a horizontal communications card on the other side."}
{"sequence": "A \"virtual midplane\" is an imaginary plane between vertical cards on one side that directly connect to horizontal boards on the other side; the card-slot aligners of the card cage and self-aligning connectors on the cards hold the cards in position."}
{"sequence": "Some people use the term \"midplane\" to describe a board that sits between and connects a hard drive hot-swap backplane and redundant power supplies."}
{"sequence": "Servers commonly have a backplane to attach hot swappable hard drives; backplane pins pass directly into hard drive sockets without cables."}
{"sequence": "They may have single connector to connect one disk array controller or multiple connectors that can be connected to one or more controllers in arbitrary way."}
{"sequence": "Backplanes are commonly found in disk enclosures, disk arrays, and servers."}
{"sequence": "Backplanes for SAS and SATA HDDs most commonly use the SGPIO protocol as means of communication between the host adapter and the backplane."}
{"sequence": "Alternatively SCSI Enclosure Services can be used."}
{"sequence": "With Parallel SCSI subsystems, SAF-TE is used."}
{"sequence": "A single-board computer meeting the PICMG 1.3 specification and compatible with a PICMG 1.3 backplane is referred to as a System Host Board."}
{"sequence": "In the Intel Single Board Computer world, PICMG provides standards for the backplane interface: PICMG 1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 provide ISA and PCI support, with 1.2 adding PCIX support."}
{"sequence": "PICMG 1.3 provides PCI-Express support."}
{"sequence": "Baldric A baldric (also baldrick, bawdrick, bauldrick as well as other rare or obsolete variations) is a belt worn over one shoulder that is typically used to carry a weapon (usually a sword) or other implement such as a bugle or drum."}
{"sequence": "The word may also refer to any belt in general, but this usage is poetic or archaic."}
{"sequence": "In modern contexts, military drum majors usually wear a baldric."}
{"sequence": "Baldrics have been used since ancient times, usually as part of military dress."}
{"sequence": "The early Islamic Arabs wore baldrics with their armor."}
{"sequence": "The design offers more support for weight than a standard waist belt, without restricting movement of the arms, and while allowing easy access to the object carried."}
{"sequence": "Alternatively, and especially in modern times, the baldric may fill a ceremonial role rather than a practical one."}
{"sequence": "During ancient Roman times the balteus (plural \"baltei\") was a type of baldric commonly used to suspend a sword."}
{"sequence": "It was a belt generally worn over the shoulder, passing obliquely down to the side, typically made of leather, often ornamented with precious stones, metals or both."}
{"sequence": "There was also a similar belt worn by the Romans, particularly by soldiers, called a \"cintus\" (pl. \""}
{"sequence": "cinti\") that fastened around the waist."}
{"sequence": "The word \"accintus\" meaning a soldier (literally, \"girt\" as for battle) attests to this differing usage."}
{"sequence": "Many non-military or paramilitary organisations include baldrics as part of ceremonial dress."}
{"sequence": "The Knights of Columbus 4th Degree Colour Corps uses a baldric as part of their uniform; it supports a ceremonial sword."}
{"sequence": "The University of Illinois Marching Illini wore two baldrics as a part of their uniform until 2009, with one over each shoulder."}
{"sequence": "They crossed in the front and back and were buttoned onto the jacket beneath a cape and epaulets."}
{"sequence": "Today, the current Marching Illini wear one baldric with two sides, ILLINI on one side and the traditional orange and white baldric from the previous uniform on the other."}
{"sequence": "A crossed pair of baldrics is often worn as part of the uniform of Morris dancers; different coloured baldrics help to distinguish different sides."}
{"sequence": "The baldric appears in the literary canon."}
{"sequence": "Britomart, in Edmund Spenser's Faerie Queene, clothes herself in a borrowed armour \"with brave bauldrick garnished\" before embarking on her quest (Book III, canto iii)."}
{"sequence": "Benedick, from William Shakespeare's \"Much Ado About Nothing\", says \"But that I will have a recheat winded in my forehead or hang my bugle in an invisible baldric all women shall pardon me.\""}

{"sequence": "Battle of Waterloo The Battle of Waterloo was fought on Sunday, 18 June 1815, near Waterloo in Belgium, part of the United Kingdom of the Netherlands at the time."}
{"sequence": "A French army under the command of Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte was defeated by two of the armies of the Seventh Coalition, a British-led coalition consisting of units from the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Hanover, Brunswick and Nassau, under the command of the Duke of Wellington, referred to by many authors as the Anglo-allied army or Wellington's army, and a Prussian army under the command of Field Marshal von Blücher, referred also as Blücher's army."}
{"sequence": "The battle marked the end of the Napoleonic Wars."}
{"sequence": "Upon Napoleon's return to power in March 1815, many states that had opposed him formed the Seventh Coalition and began to mobilise armies."}
{"sequence": "Wellington and Blücher's armies were cantoned close to the northeastern border of France."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon planned to attack them separately in the hope of destroying them before they could join in a coordinated invasion of France with other members of the coalition."}
{"sequence": "On 16 June, Napoleon successfully attacked the bulk of the Prussian army at the Battle of Ligny with his main force, causing the Prussians to withdraw northwards on 17 June, but parallel to Wellington and in good order."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon sent a third of his forces to pursue the Prussians, which resulted in the separate Battle of Wavre with the Prussian rear-guard on 18–19 June, and prevented that French force from participating at Waterloo."}
{"sequence": "Also on 16 June, a small portion of the French army contested the Battle of Quatre Bras with the Anglo-allied army."}
{"sequence": "The Anglo-allied army held their ground on 16 June, but the withdrawal of the Prussians caused Wellington to withdraw north to Waterloo on 17 June."}
{"sequence": "Upon learning that the Prussian army was able to support him, Wellington decided to offer battle on the Mont-Saint-Jean escarpment across the Brussels road, near the village of Waterloo."}
{"sequence": "Here he withstood repeated attacks by the French throughout the afternoon of 18 June, aided by the progressively arriving Prussians who attacked the French flank and inflicted heavy casualties."}
{"sequence": "In the evening Napoleon assaulted the Anglo-allied line with his last reserves, the senior infantry battalions of the French Imperial Guard."}
{"sequence": "With the Prussians breaking through on the French right flank, the Anglo-allied army repulsed the Imperial Guard, and the French army was routed."}
{"sequence": "Waterloo was the decisive engagement of the Waterloo Campaign and Napoleon's last."}
{"sequence": "According to Wellington, the battle was \"the nearest-run thing you ever saw in your life\"."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon abdicated four days later, and coalition forces entered Paris on 7 July."}
{"sequence": "The defeat at Waterloo ended Napoleon's rule as Emperor of the French and marked the end of his Hundred Days return from exile."}
{"sequence": "This ended the First French Empire and set a chronological milestone between serial European wars and decades of relative peace, often referred to as the \"Pax Britannica\"."}
{"sequence": "The battlefield is located in the Belgian municipalities of Braine-l'Alleud and Lasne, about south of Brussels, and about from the town of Waterloo."}
{"sequence": "The site of the battlefield today is dominated by the monument of the Lion's Mound, a large artificial hill constructed from earth taken from the battlefield itself; the topography of the battlefield near the mound has not been preserved."}
{"sequence": "Four days later, the United Kingdom, Russia, Austria, and Prussia mobilised armies to defeat Napoleon."}
{"sequence": "Critically outnumbered, Napoleon knew that once his attempts at dissuading one or more members of the Seventh Coalition from invading France had failed, his only chance of remaining in power was to attack before the coalition mobilised."}
{"sequence": "Had Napoleon succeeded in destroying the existing coalition forces south of Brussels before they were reinforced, he might have been able to drive the British back to the sea and knock the Prussians out of the war."}
{"sequence": "Crucially, this would have bought him time to recruit and train more men before turning his armies against the Austrians and Russians."}
{"sequence": "An additional consideration for Napoleon was that a French victory might cause French-speaking sympathisers in Belgium to launch a friendly revolution."}
{"sequence": "Also, coalition troops in Belgium were largely second-line, as many units were of dubious quality and loyalty, and most of the British veterans of the Peninsular War had been sent to North America to fight in the War of 1812."}
{"sequence": "The initial dispositions of British commander Arthur Wellesley, 1st Duke of Wellington, were intended to counter the threat of Napoleon enveloping the Coalition armies by moving through Mons to the south-west of Brussels."}
{"sequence": "This would have pushed Wellington closer to the Prussian forces, led by Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher, but might have cut Wellington's communications with his base at Ostend."}
{"sequence": "In order to delay Wellington's deployment, Napoleon spread false intelligence which suggested that Wellington's supply chain from the channel ports would be cut."}
{"sequence": "By June, Napoleon had raised a total army strength of about 300,000 men."}
{"sequence": "The force at his disposal at Waterloo was less than one third that size, but the rank and file were nearly all loyal and experienced soldiers."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon divided his army into a left wing commanded by Marshal Ney, a right wing commanded by Marshal Grouchy and a reserve under his command (although all three elements remained close enough to support one another)."}
{"sequence": "He hoped this would prevent them from combining, and he would be able to destroy first the Prussian's army, then Wellington's."}
{"sequence": "Only very late on the night of 15 June was Wellington certain that the Charleroi attack was the main French thrust."}
{"sequence": "In the early hours of 16 June, at the Duchess of Richmond's ball in Brussels, he received a dispatch from the Prince of Orange and was shocked by the speed of Napoleon's advance."}
{"sequence": "He hastily ordered his army to concentrate on Quatre Bras, where the Prince of Orange, with the brigade of Prince Bernhard of Saxe-Weimar, was holding a tenuous position against the soldiers of Ney's left wing."}
{"sequence": "Ney's orders were to secure the crossroads of Quatre Bras, so that he could later swing east and reinforce Napoleon if necessary."}
{"sequence": "Ney found the crossroads of Quatre Bras lightly held by the Prince of Orange, who repelled Ney's initial attacks but was gradually driven back by overwhelming numbers of French troops."}
{"sequence": "First reinforcements, and then Wellington arrived."}
{"sequence": "He took command and drove Ney back, securing the crossroads by early evening, too late to send help to the Prussians, who had already been defeated."}
{"sequence": "Meanwhile on 16 June, Napoleon attacked and defeated Blücher's Prussians at the Battle of Ligny using part of the reserve and the right wing of his army."}
{"sequence": "The Prussian centre gave way under heavy French assaults, but the flanks held their ground."}
{"sequence": "went uninterrupted and seemingly unnoticed by the French."}
{"sequence": "The bulk of their rearguard units held their positions until about midnight, and some elements did not move out until the following morning, ignored by the French."}
{"sequence": "Crucially, the Prussians did not retreat to the east, along their own lines of communication."}
{"sequence": "Instead, they, too, fell back northwards—parallel to Wellington's line of march, still within supporting distance and in communication with him throughout."}
{"sequence": "The Prussians rallied on Bülow's IV Corps, which had not been engaged at Ligny and was in a strong position south of Wavre."}
{"sequence": "With the Prussian retreat from Ligny, Wellington's position at Quatre Bras was untenable."}
{"sequence": "The next day he withdrew northwards, to a defensive position he had reconnoitred the previous year—the low ridge of Mont-Saint-Jean, south of the village of Waterloo and the Sonian Forest."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon, with the reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the position empty."}
{"sequence": "The French pursued Wellington's retreating army to Waterloo; however, due to bad weather, mud and the head start that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry action at Genappe, there was no substantial engagement."}
{"sequence": "Before leaving Ligny, Napoleon had ordered Grouchy, who commanded the right wing, to with 33,000 men."}
{"sequence": "A late start, uncertainty about the direction the Prussians had taken, and the vagueness of the orders given to him, meant that Grouchy was too late to prevent the Prussian army reaching Wavre, from where it could march to support Wellington."}
{"sequence": "More importantly, the heavily outnumbered Prussian rear-guard was able to use the River Dyle to enable a savage and prolonged action to delay Grouchy."}
{"sequence": "As 17 June drew to a close, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following."}
{"sequence": "Blücher's army was gathering in and around Wavre, around to the east of the town."}
{"sequence": "Early on the morning of the 18th, Wellington received an assurance from Blücher that the Prussian army would support him."}
{"sequence": "He decided to hold his ground and give battle."}
{"sequence": "Three armies participated in the battle: Napoleon's \"Armée du Nord\", a multinational army under Wellington, and a Prussian army under Blücher."}
{"sequence": "The French army of around 69,000 consisted of 48,000 infantry, 14,000 cavalry, and 7,000 artillery with 250 guns."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon had used conscription to fill the ranks of the French army throughout his rule, but he did not conscript men for the 1815 campaign."}
{"sequence": "His troops were mainly veterans with considerable experience and a fierce devotion to their Emperor."}
{"sequence": "The cavalry in particular was both numerous and formidable, and included fourteen regiments of armoured heavy cavalry, and seven of highly versatile lancers who were armed with lances, sabres and firearms."}
{"sequence": "However, as the army took shape, French officers were allocated to units as they presented themselves for duty, so that many units were commanded by officers the soldiers didn't know, and often didn't trust."}
{"sequence": "Crucially, some of these officers had little experience in working together as a unified force, so that support for other units was often not given."}
{"sequence": "The French army was forced to march through rain and black coal-dust mud to reach Waterloo, and then to contend with mud and rain as it slept in the open."}
{"sequence": "Little food was available for the soldiers, but nevertheless the veteran French soldiers were fiercely loyal to Napoleon."}
{"sequence": "Wellington later said that he had \"an infamous army, very weak and ill-equipped, and a very inexperienced Staff\"."}
{"sequence": "His troops consisted of 67,000 men: 50,000 infantry, 11,000 cavalry, and 6,000 artillery with 150 guns."}
{"sequence": "Of these, 25,000 were British, with another 6,000 from the King's German Legion (KGL)."}
{"sequence": "All of the British Army troops were regular soldiers, but only 7,000 of them were Peninsular War veterans."}
{"sequence": "In addition, there were 17,000 Dutch and Belgian troops, 11,000 from Hanover, 6,000 from Brunswick, and 3,000 from Nassau."}
{"sequence": "Many of the troops in the Coalition armies were inexperienced."}
{"sequence": "The Dutch army had been re-established in 1815, following the earlier defeat of Napoleon."}
{"sequence": "With the exception of the British and some from Hanover and Brunswick who had fought with the British army in Spain, many of the professional soldiers in the Coalition armies had spent some of their time in the French army or in armies allied to the Napoleonic regime."}
{"sequence": "The historian Alessandro Barbero states that in this heterogeneous army the difference between British and foreign troops did not prove significant under fire."}
{"sequence": "Wellington was also acutely short of heavy cavalry, having only seven British and three Dutch regiments."}
{"sequence": "The Duke of York imposed many of his staff officers on Wellington, including his second-in-command the Earl of Uxbridge."}
{"sequence": "Uxbridge commanded the cavalry and had carte blanche from Wellington to commit these forces at his discretion."}
{"sequence": "Wellington stationed a further 17,000 troops at Halle, away to the west."}
{"sequence": "They were mostly composed of Dutch troops under the Prince of Orange's younger brother Prince Frederick of the Netherlands."}
{"sequence": "They were placed as a guard against any possible wide flanking movement by the French forces, and also to act as a rearguard if Wellington was forced to retreat towards Antwerp and the coast."}
{"sequence": "The Prussian army was in the throes of reorganisation."}
{"sequence": "In 1815, the former Reserve regiments, Legions, and \"Freikorps\" volunteer formations from the wars of 1813–1814 were in the process of being absorbed into the line, along with many \"Landwehr\" (militia) regiments."}
{"sequence": "The \"Landwehr\" were mostly untrained and unequipped when they arrived in Belgium."}
{"sequence": "The Prussian cavalry were in a similar state."}
{"sequence": "Its artillery was also reorganising and did not give its best performance—guns and equipment continued to arrive during and after the battle."}
{"sequence": "Offsetting these handicaps, the Prussian Army had excellent and professional leadership in its General Staff organisation."}
{"sequence": "These officers came from four schools developed for this purpose and thus worked to a common standard of training."}
{"sequence": "This system was in marked contrast to the conflicting, vague orders issued by the French army."}
{"sequence": "This staff system ensured that before Ligny, three-quarters of the Prussian army concentrated for battle with 24 hours' notice."}
{"sequence": "After Ligny, the Prussian army, although defeated, was able to realign its supply train, reorganise itself, and intervene decisively on the Waterloo battlefield within 48 hours."}
{"sequence": "Two and a half Prussian army corps, or 48,000 men, were engaged at Waterloo; two brigades under Bülow, commander of IV Corps, attacked Lobau at 16:30, while Zieten's I Corps and parts of Pirch I's II Corps engaged at about 18:00."}
{"sequence": "The Waterloo position was a strong one."}
{"sequence": "It consisted of a long ridge running east–west, perpendicular to, and bisected by, the main road to Brussels."}
{"sequence": "Along the crest of the ridge ran the Ohain road, a deep sunken lane."}
{"sequence": "Near the crossroads with the Brussels road was a large elm tree that was roughly in the centre of Wellington's position and served as his command post for much of the day."}
{"sequence": "Wellington deployed his infantry in a line just behind the crest of the ridge following the Ohain road."}
{"sequence": "Using the reverse slope, as he had many times previously, Wellington concealed his strength from the French, with the exception of his skirmishers and artillery."}
{"sequence": "This allowed Wellington to draw up his forces in depth, which he did in the centre and on the right, all the way towards the village of Braine-l'Alleud, in the expectation that the Prussians would reinforce his left during the day."}
{"sequence": "In front of the ridge, there were three positions that could be fortified."}
{"sequence": "On the extreme right were the château, garden, and orchard of Hougoumont."}
{"sequence": "This was a large and well-built country house, initially hidden in trees."}
{"sequence": "The house faced north along a sunken, covered lane (usually described by the British as \"the hollow-way\") along which it could be supplied."}
{"sequence": "On the extreme left was the hamlet of Papelotte."}
{"sequence": "Both Hougoumont and Papelotte were fortified and garrisoned, and thus anchored Wellington's flanks securely."}
{"sequence": "Papelotte also commanded the road to Wavre that the Prussians would use to send reinforcements to Wellington's position."}
{"sequence": "On the western side of the main road, and in front of the rest of Wellington's line, was the farmhouse and orchard of La Haye Sainte, which was garrisoned with 400 light infantry of the King's German Legion."}
{"sequence": "On the opposite side of the road was a disused sand quarry, where the 95th Rifles were posted as sharpshooters."}
{"sequence": "Wellington's forces positioning presented a formidable challenge to any attacking force."}
{"sequence": "Any attempt to turn Wellington's right would entail taking the entrenched Hougoumont position."}
{"sequence": "Any attack on his right centre would mean the attackers would have to march between enfilading fire from Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte."}
{"sequence": "On the left, any attack would also be enfiladed by fire from La Haye Sainte and its adjoining sandpit, and any attempt at turning the left flank would entail fighting through the lanes and hedgerows surrounding Papelotte and the other garrisoned buildings on that flank, and some very wet ground in the Smohain defile."}
{"sequence": "The French army formed on the slopes of another ridge to the south."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon could not see Wellington's positions, so he drew his forces up symmetrically about the Brussels road."}
{"sequence": "On the right was I Corps under d'Erlon with 16,000 infantry and 1,500 cavalry, plus a cavalry reserve of 4,700."}
{"sequence": "On the left was II Corps under Reille with 13,000 infantry, and 1,300 cavalry, and a cavalry reserve of 4,600."}
{"sequence": "In the centre about the road south of the inn \"La Belle Alliance\" were a reserve including Lobau's VI Corps with 6,000 men, the 13,000 infantry of the Imperial Guard, and a cavalry reserve of 2,000."}
{"sequence": "In the right rear of the French position was the substantial village of Plancenoit, and at the extreme right, the \"Bois de Paris\" wood."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon initially commanded the battle from Rossomme farm, where he could see the entire battlefield, but moved to a position near \"La Belle Alliance\" early in the afternoon."}
{"sequence": "Command on the battlefield (which was largely hidden from his view) was delegated to Ney."}
{"sequence": "Wellington rose at around 02:00 or 03:00 on 18 June, and wrote letters until dawn."}
{"sequence": "He had earlier written to Blücher confirming that he would give battle at Mont-Saint-Jean if Blücher could provide him with at least one corps; otherwise he would retreat towards Brussels."}
{"sequence": "At a late-night council, Blücher's chief of staff, August Neidhardt von Gneisenau, had been distrustful of Wellington's strategy, but Blücher persuaded him that they should march to join Wellington's army."}
{"sequence": "In the morning Wellington duly received a reply from Blücher, promising to support him with three corps."}
{"sequence": "From 06:00 Wellington was in the field supervising the deployment of his forces."}
{"sequence": "At Wavre, the Prussian IV Corps under Bülow was designated to lead the march to Waterloo as it was in the best shape, not having been involved in the Battle of Ligny."}
{"sequence": "Although they had not taken casualties, IV Corps had been marching for two days, covering the retreat of the three other corps of the Prussian army from the battlefield of Ligny."}
{"sequence": "They had been posted farthest away from the battlefield, and progress was very slow."}
{"sequence": "The roads were in poor condition after the night's heavy rain, and Bülow's men had to pass through the congested streets of Wavre and move 88 artillery pieces."}
{"sequence": "Matters were not helped when a fire broke out in Wavre, blocking several streets along Bülow's intended route."}
{"sequence": "As a result, the last part of the corps left at 10:00, six hours after the leading elements had moved out towards Waterloo."}
{"sequence": "Bülow's men were followed to Waterloo first by I Corps and then by II Corps."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon breakfasted off silver plate at \"Le Caillou\", the house where he had spent the night."}
{"sequence": "When Soult suggested that Grouchy should be recalled to join the main force, Napoleon said, \"Just because you have all been beaten by Wellington, you think he's a good general."}
{"sequence": "I tell you Wellington is a bad general, the English are bad troops, and this affair is nothing more than eating breakfast\"."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon's seemingly dismissive remark may have been strategic, given his maxim \"in war, morale is everything\"."}
{"sequence": "He had acted similarly in the past, and on the morning of the battle of Waterloo may have been responding to the pessimism and objections of his chief of staff and senior generals."}
{"sequence": "Later on, being told by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British officers at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in Genappe that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would be dealt with by Grouchy."}
{"sequence": "Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at \"Le Caillou\" had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon had delayed the start of the battle owing to the sodden ground, which would have made manoeuvring cavalry and artillery difficult."}
{"sequence": "In addition, many of his forces had bivouacked well to the south of \"La Belle Alliance\"."}
{"sequence": "At 10:00, in response to a dispatch he had received from Grouchy six hours earlier, he sent a reply telling Grouchy to \"head for Wavre [to Grouchy's north] in order to draw near to us [to the west of Grouchy]\" and then \"push before him\" the Prussians to arrive at Waterloo \"as soon as possible\"."}
{"sequence": "At 11:00, Napoleon drafted his general order: Reille's Corps on the left and d'Erlon's Corps to the right were to attack the village of Mont-Saint-Jean and keep abreast of one another."}
{"sequence": "This order assumed Wellington's battle-line was in the village, rather than at the more forward position on the ridge."}
{"sequence": "To enable this, Jerome's division would make an initial attack on Hougoumont, which Napoleon expected would draw in Wellington's reserves, since its loss would threaten his communications with the sea."}
{"sequence": "A \"grande batterie\" of the reserve artillery of I, II, and VI Corps was to then bombard the centre of Wellington's position from about 13:00."}
{"sequence": "D'Erlon's corps would then attack Wellington's left, break through, and roll up his line from east to west."}
{"sequence": "In his memoirs, Napoleon wrote that his intention was to separate Wellington's army from the Prussians and drive it back towards the sea."}
{"sequence": "Historian Andrew Roberts notes that \"It is a curious fact about the Battle of Waterloo that no one is absolutely certain when it actually began\"."}
{"sequence": "Wellington recorded in his dispatches that at \"about ten o'clock [Napoleon] commenced a furious attack upon our post at Hougoumont\"."}
{"sequence": "Other sources state that the attack began around 11:30."}
{"sequence": "The house and its immediate environs were defended by four light companies of Guards, and the wood and park by Hanoverian \"Jäger\" and the 1/2nd Nassau."}
{"sequence": "The initial attack by Bauduin's brigade emptied the wood and park, but was driven back by heavy British artillery fire, and cost Bauduin his life."}
{"sequence": "As the British guns were distracted by a duel with French artillery, a second attack by Soye's brigade and what had been Bauduin's succeeded in reaching the north gate of the house."}
{"sequence": "Sous-Lieutenant Legros, a French officer, broke the gate open with an axe, and some French troops managed to enter the courtyard."}
{"sequence": "The Coldstream Guards and the Scots Guards arrived to support the defence."}
{"sequence": "There was a fierce melee, and the British managed to close the gate on the French troops streaming in."}
{"sequence": "The Frenchmen trapped in the courtyard were all killed."}
{"sequence": "Only a young drummer boy was spared."}
{"sequence": "Fighting continued around Hougoumont all afternoon."}
{"sequence": "Its surroundings were heavily invested by French light infantry, and coordinated attacks were made against the troops behind Hougoumont."}
{"sequence": "Wellington's army defended the house and the hollow way running north from it."}
{"sequence": "In the afternoon, Napoleon personally ordered the house to be shelled to set it on fire, resulting in the destruction of all but the chapel."}
{"sequence": "Du Plat's brigade of the King's German Legion was brought forward to defend the hollow way, which they had to do without senior officers."}
{"sequence": "Eventually they were relieved by the 71st Highlanders, a British infantry regiment."}
{"sequence": "Adam's brigade was further reinforced by Hugh Halkett's 3rd Hanoverian Brigade, and successfully repulsed further infantry and cavalry attacks sent by Reille."}
{"sequence": "Hougoumont held out until the end of the battle."}
{"sequence": "The fighting at Hougoumont has often been characterised as a diversionary attack to draw in Wellington's reserves which escalated into an all-day battle and drew in French reserves instead."}
{"sequence": "In fact there is a good case to believe that both Napoleon and Wellington thought that holding Hougoumont was key to winning the battle."}
{"sequence": "Hougoumont was a part of the battlefield that Napoleon could see clearly, and he continued to direct resources towards it and its surroundings all afternoon (33 battalions in all, 14,000 troops)."}
{"sequence": "Similarly, though the house never contained a large number of troops, Wellington devoted 21 battalions (12,000 troops) over the course of the afternoon in keeping the hollow way open to allow fresh troops and ammunition to reach the buildings."}
{"sequence": "He moved several artillery batteries from his hard-pressed centre to support Hougoumont, and later stated that \"the success of the battle turned upon closing the gates at Hougoumont\"."}
{"sequence": "The 80 guns of Napoleon's \"grande batterie\" drew up in the centre."}
{"sequence": "These opened fire at 11:50, according to Lord Hill (commander of the Anglo-allied II Corps), while other sources put the time between noon and 13:30."}
{"sequence": "The \"grande batterie\" was too far back to aim accurately, and the only other troops they could see were skirmishers of the regiments of Kempt and Pack, and Perponcher's 2nd Dutch division (the others were employing Wellington's characteristic \"reverse slope defence\")."}
{"sequence": "Nevertheless, the bombardment caused a large number of casualties."}
{"sequence": "Although some projectiles buried themselves in the soft soil, most found their marks on the reverse slope of the ridge."}
{"sequence": "The bombardment forced the cavalry of the Union Brigade (in third line) to move to its left, as did the Scots Greys, to reduce their casualty rate."}
{"sequence": "At about 13:00, Napoleon saw the first columns of Prussians around the village of Lasne-Chapelle-Saint-Lambert, away from his right flank—about three hours march for an army."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon's reaction was to have Marshal Soult send a message to Grouchy telling him to come towards the battlefield and attack the arriving Prussians."}
{"sequence": "Grouchy, however, had been executing Napoleon's previous orders to follow the Prussians \"with your sword against his back\" towards Wavre, and was by then too far away to reach Waterloo."}
{"sequence": "Grouchy was advised by his subordinate, Gérard, to \"march to the sound of the guns\", but stuck to his orders and engaged the Prussian III Corps rear guard under the command of Lieutenant-General Baron Johann von Thielmann at the Battle of Wavre."}
{"sequence": "Moreover, Soult's letter ordering Grouchy to move quickly to join Napoleon and attack Bülow would not actually reach Grouchy until after 20:00."}
{"sequence": "A little after 13:00, I Corps' attack began in large columns."}
{"sequence": "Bernard Cornwell writes \"[column] suggests an elongated formation with its narrow end aimed like a spear at the enemy line, while in truth it was much more like a brick advancing sideways and d'Erlon's assault was made up of four such bricks, each one a division of French infantry\"."}
{"sequence": "Each division, with one exception, was drawn up in huge masses, consisting of the eight or nine battalions of which they were formed, deployed, and placed in a column one behind the other, with only five paces interval between the battalions."}
{"sequence": "The one exception was the 1st Division (Commanded by Quiot, the leader of the 1st Brigade)."}
{"sequence": "Its two brigades were formed in a similar manner, but side by side instead of behind one another."}
{"sequence": "This was done because, being on the left of the four divisions, it was ordered to send one (Quiot's brigade) against the south and west of La Haye Sainte, while the other (Bourgeois') was to attack the eastern side of the same post."}
{"sequence": "The divisions were to advance in echelon from the left at a distance of 400 paces apart—the 2nd Division (Donzelot's) on the right of Bourgeois' brigade, the 3rd Division (Marcognet's) next, and the 4th Division (Durutte's) on the right."}
{"sequence": "They were led by Ney to the assault, each column having a front of about a hundred and sixty to two hundred files."}
{"sequence": "The leftmost division advanced on the walled farmhouse compound La Haye Sainte."}
{"sequence": "The farmhouse was defended by the King's German Legion."}
{"sequence": "While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out to either side and, with the support of several squadrons of cuirassiers, succeeded in isolating the farmhouse."}
{"sequence": "The King's German Legion resolutely defended the farmhouse."}
{"sequence": "Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off."}
{"sequence": "The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneburg Battalion in line."}
{"sequence": "Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed."}
{"sequence": "At the point they aimed for they faced 6,000 men: the first line consisted of the Dutch 1st \"Brigade van Bylandt\" of the 2nd Dutch division, flanked by the British brigades of Kempt and Pack on either side."}
{"sequence": "The second line consisted of British and Hanoverian troops under Sir Thomas Picton, who were lying down in dead ground behind the ridge."}
{"sequence": "All had suffered badly at Quatre Bras."}
{"sequence": "In addition, the Bijlandt brigade had been ordered to deploy its skirmishers in the hollow road and on the forward slope."}
{"sequence": "The rest of the brigade was lying down just behind the road."}
{"sequence": "At the moment these skirmishers were rejoining their parent battalions, the brigade was ordered to its feet and started to return fire."}
{"sequence": "On the left of the brigade, where the 7th Dutch Militia stood, a \"few files were shot down and an opening in the line thus occurred\"."}
{"sequence": "The battalion had no reserves and was unable to close the gap."}
{"sequence": "D'Erlon's troops pushed through this gap in the line and the remaining battalions in the Bylandt brigade (8th Dutch Militia and Belgian 7th Line Battalion) were forced to retreat to the square of the 5th Dutch Militia, which was in reserve between Picton's troops, about 100 paces to the rear."}
{"sequence": "There they regrouped under the command of Colonel Van Zuylen van Nijevelt."}
{"sequence": "A moment later the Prince of Orange ordered a counterattack, which actually occurred around 10 minutes later."}
{"sequence": "Bylandt was wounded and retired off the field, passing command of the brigade to Lt."}
{"sequence": "Kol."}
{"sequence": "De Jongh."}
{"sequence": "D'Erlon's men ascended the slope and advanced on the sunken road, \"Chemin d'Ohain\", that ran from behind La Haye Sainte and continued east."}
{"sequence": "It was lined on both sides by thick hedges, with Bylandt's brigade just across the road while the British brigades had been lying down some 100 yards back from the road, Pack's to Bylandt's left and Kempt's to Bylandt's right."}
{"sequence": "Kempt's 1,900 men were engaged by Bourgeois' brigade of 1,900 men of Quiot's division."}
{"sequence": "In the centre, Donzelot's division had pushed back Bylandt's brigade."}
{"sequence": "On the right of the French advance was Marcognet's division led by Grenier's brigade consisting of the \"45e Régiment de Ligne\" and followed by the \"25e Régiment de Ligne\", somewhat less than 2,000 men, and behind them, Nogue's brigade of the \"21e\" and \"45e\" regiments."}
{"sequence": "Opposing them on the other side of the road was Pack's 9th Brigade consisting of the 44th Foot and three Scottish regiments: the Royal Scots, the 42nd Black Watch, and the 92nd Gordons, totalling something over 2,000 men."}
{"sequence": "A very even fight between British and French infantry was about to occur."}
{"sequence": "The French advance drove in the British skirmishers and reached the sunken road."}
{"sequence": "As they did so, Pack's men stood up, formed into a four deep line formation for fear of the French cavalry, advanced, and opened fire."}
{"sequence": "However, a firefight had been anticipated and the French infantry had accordingly advanced in more linear formation."}
{"sequence": "Now, fully deployed into line, they returned fire and successfully pressed the British troops; although the attack faltered at the centre, the line in front of d'Erlon's right started to crumble."}
{"sequence": "Picton was killed shortly after ordering the counter-attack and the British and Hanoverian troops also began to give way under the pressure of numbers."}
{"sequence": "Pack's regiments, all four ranks deep, advanced to attack the French in the road but faltered and began to fire on the French instead of charging."}
{"sequence": "The 42nd Black Watch halted at the hedge and the resulting fire-fight drove back the British 92nd Foot while the leading French \"45e Ligne\" burst through the hedge cheering."}
{"sequence": "Along the sunken road, the French were forcing the Anglo-allies back, the British line was dispersing, and at two o'clock in the afternoon Napoleon was winning the Battle of Waterloo."}
{"sequence": "Reports from Baron von Müffling, the Prussian liaison officer attached to Wellington's army, relate that: \"After 3 o'clock the Duke's situation became critical, unless the succour of the Prussian army arrived soon\"."}
{"sequence": "At this crucial juncture, Uxbridge ordered his two brigades of British heavy cavalry—formed unseen behind the ridge—to charge in support of the hard-pressed infantry."}
{"sequence": "The 1st Brigade, known as the Household Brigade, commanded by Major-General Lord Edward Somerset, consisted of guards regiments: the 1st and 2nd Life Guards, the Royal Horse Guards (the Blues), and the 1st (King's) Dragoon Guards."}
{"sequence": "The 2nd Brigade, also known as the Union Brigade, commanded by Major-General Sir William Ponsonby, was so called as it consisted of an English, the 1st (The Royals); a Scottish, 2nd ('Scots Greys'); and an Irish, 6th (Inniskilling); regiment of heavy dragoons."}
{"sequence": "More than 20 years of warfare had eroded the numbers of suitable cavalry mounts available on the European continent; this resulted in the British heavy cavalry entering the 1815 campaign with the finest horses of any contemporary cavalry arm."}
{"sequence": "British cavalry troopers also received excellent mounted swordsmanship training."}
{"sequence": "They were, however, inferior to the French in manoeuvring in large formations, cavalier in attitude, and unlike the infantry some units had scant experience of warfare."}
{"sequence": "The Scots Greys, for example, had not been in action since 1795."}
{"sequence": "According to Wellington, though they were superior individual horsemen, they were inflexible and lacked tactical ability. \""}
{"sequence": "I considered one squadron a match for two French, I didn't like to see four British opposed to four French: and as the numbers increased and order, of course, became more necessary I was the more unwilling to risk our men without having a superiority in numbers.\""}
{"sequence": "The two brigades had a combined field strength of about 2,000 (2,651 official strength); they charged with the 47-year-old Uxbridge leading them and a very inadequate number of squadrons held in reserve."}
{"sequence": "There is evidence that Uxbridge gave an order, the morning of the battle, to all cavalry brigade commanders to commit their commands on their own initiative, as direct orders from himself might not always be forthcoming, and to \"support movements to their front\"."}
{"sequence": "It appears that Uxbridge expected the brigades of Sir John Ormsby Vandeleur, Hussey Vivian and the Dutch cavalry to provide support to the British heavies."}
{"sequence": "Uxbridge later regretted leading the charge in person, saying \"I committed a great mistake\", when he should have been organising an adequate reserve to move forward in support."}
{"sequence": "The Household Brigade crossed the crest of the Anglo-allied position and charged downhill."}
{"sequence": "The cuirassiers guarding d'Erlon's left flank were still dispersed, and so were swept over the deeply sunken main road and then routed."}
{"sequence": "Continuing their attack, the squadrons on the left of the Household Brigade then destroyed Aulard's brigade."}
{"sequence": "Despite attempts to recall them, they continued past La Haye Sainte and found themselves at the bottom of the hill on blown horses facing Schmitz's brigade formed in squares."}
{"sequence": "To their left, the Union Brigade suddenly swept through the infantry lines, giving rise to the legend that some of the 92nd Gordon Highland Regiment clung onto their stirrups and accompanied them into the charge."}
{"sequence": "From the centre leftwards, the Royal Dragoons destroyed Bourgeois' brigade, capturing the eagle of the 105th \"Ligne\"."}
{"sequence": "The Inniskillings routed the other brigade of Quoit's division, and the Scots Greys came upon the lead French regiment, 45th \"Ligne\", as it was still reforming after having crossed the sunken road and broken through the hedge row in pursuit of the British infantry."}
{"sequence": "The Greys captured the eagle of the 45th \"Ligne\" and overwhelmed Grenier's brigade."}
{"sequence": "These would be the only two French eagles captured by the British during the battle."}
{"sequence": "On Wellington's extreme left, Durutte's division had time to form squares and fend off groups of Greys."}
{"sequence": "As with the Household Cavalry, the officers of the Royals and Inniskillings found it very difficult to rein back their troops, who lost all cohesion."}
{"sequence": "Having taken casualties, and still trying to reorder themselves, the Scots Greys and the rest of the Union Brigade found themselves before the main French lines."}
{"sequence": "Their horses were blown, and they were still in disorder without any idea of what their next collective objective was."}
{"sequence": "Some attacked nearby gun batteries of the Grande Battery."}
{"sequence": "Although the Greys had neither the time nor means to disable the cannon or carry them off, they put very many out of action as the gun crews were killed or fled the battlefield."}
{"sequence": "Sergeant Major Dickinson of the Greys stated that his regiment was rallied before going on to attack the French artillery: Hamilton, the regimental commander, rather than holding them back cried out to his men \"Charge, charge the guns!\""}
{"sequence": "Napoleon promptly responded by ordering a counter-attack by the cuirassier brigades of Farine and Travers and Jaquinot's two Chevau-léger (lancer) regiments in the I Corps light cavalry division."}
{"sequence": "Disorganized and milling about the bottom of the valley between Hougoumont and La Belle Alliance, the Scots Greys and the rest of the British heavy cavalry were taken by surprise by the countercharge of Milhaud's cuirassiers, joined by lancers from Baron Jaquinot's 1st Cavalry Division."}
{"sequence": "As Ponsonby tried to rally his men against the French cuirassers, he was attacked by Jaquinot's lancers and captured."}
{"sequence": "A nearby party of Scots Greys saw the capture and attempted to rescue their brigade commander."}
{"sequence": "However, the French lancer who had captured Ponsonby killed him and then used his lance to kill three of the Scots Greys who had attempted the rescue."}
{"sequence": "By the time Ponsonby died, the momentum had entirely returned in favour of the French."}
{"sequence": "Milhaud's and Jaquinot's cavalrymen drove the Union Brigade from the valley."}
{"sequence": "The result was very heavy losses for the British cavalry."}
{"sequence": "A countercharge, by British light dragoons under Major-General Vandeleur and Dutch–Belgian light dragoons and hussars under Major-General Ghigny on the left wing, and Dutch–Belgian \"carabiniers\" under Major-General Trip in the centre, repelled the French cavalry."}
{"sequence": "All figures quoted for the losses of the cavalry brigades as a result of this charge are estimates, as casualties were only noted down after the day of the battle and were for the battle as a whole."}
{"sequence": "Some historians, Barbero for example, believe the official rolls tend to overestimate the number of cavalrymen present in their squadrons on the field of battle and that the proportionate losses were, as a result, considerably higher than the numbers on paper might suggest."}
{"sequence": "The Union Brigade lost heavily in both officers and men killed (including its commander, William Ponsonby, and Colonel Hamilton of the Scots Greys) and wounded."}
{"sequence": "The 2nd Life Guards and the King's Dragoon Guards of the Household Brigade also lost heavily (with Colonel Fuller, commander of the King's DG, killed)."}
{"sequence": "However, the 1st Life Guards, on the extreme right of the charge, and the Blues, who formed a reserve, had kept their cohesion and consequently suffered significantly fewer casualties."}
{"sequence": "On the rolls the official, or paper strength, for both Brigades is given as 2,651 while Barbero and others estimate the actual strength at around 2,000 and the official recorded losses for the two heavy cavalry brigades during the battle was 1,205 troopers and 1,303 horses."}
{"sequence": "Some historians, such as Chandler, Weller, Uffindell, and Corum, assert that the British heavy cavalry were destroyed as a viable force following their first, epic charge."}
{"sequence": "Barbero states that the Scots Greys were practically wiped out and that the other two regiments of the Union Brigade suffered comparable losses."}
{"sequence": "Other historians, such as Clark-Kennedy and Wood, citing British eyewitness accounts, describe the continuing role of the heavy cavalry after their charge."}
{"sequence": "The heavy brigades, far from being ineffective, continued to provide valuable services."}
{"sequence": "They countercharged French cavalry numerous times (both brigades), halted a combined cavalry and infantry attack (Household Brigade only), were used to bolster the morale of those units in their vicinity at times of crisis, and filled gaps in the Anglo-allied line caused by high casualties in infantry formations (both brigades)."}
{"sequence": "This service was rendered at a very high cost, as close combat with French cavalry, carbine fire, infantry musketry, and—more deadly than all of these—artillery fire steadily eroded the number of effectives in the two brigades."}
{"sequence": "At 6 o'clock in the afternoon the whole Union Brigade could field only three squadrons, though these countercharged French cavalry, losing half their number in the process."}
{"sequence": "At the end of the fighting, the two brigades, by this time combined, could muster one squadron."}
{"sequence": "Fourteen thousand French troops of d'Erlon's I Corps had been committed to this attack."}
{"sequence": "The I Corps had been driven in rout back across the valley costing Napoleon 3,000 casualties including over 2,000 prisoners taken."}
{"sequence": "Also some valuable time was lost, as the charge had dispersed numerous units and it would take until 16:00 for d'Erlon's shaken corps to reform."}
{"sequence": "And although elements of the Prussians now began to appear on the field to his right, Napoleon had already ordered Lobau's VI corps to move to the right flank to hold them back before d'Erlon's attack began."}
{"sequence": "A little before 16:00, Ney noted an apparent exodus from Wellington's centre."}
{"sequence": "He mistook the movement of casualties to the rear for the beginnings of a retreat, and sought to exploit it."}
{"sequence": "Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right."}
{"sequence": "Ney therefore tried to break Wellington's centre with cavalry alone."}
{"sequence": "Initially, Milhaud's reserve cavalry corps of cuirassiers and Lefebvre-Desnoëttes' light cavalry division of the Imperial Guard, some 4,800 sabres, were committed."}
{"sequence": "When these were repulsed, Kellermann's heavy cavalry corps and Guyot's heavy cavalry of the Guard were added to the massed assault, a total of around 9,000 cavalry in 67 squadrons."}
{"sequence": "When Napoleon saw the charge he said it was an hour too soon."}
{"sequence": "Wellington's infantry responded by forming squares (hollow box-formations four ranks deep)."}
{"sequence": "Squares were much smaller than usually depicted in paintings of the battle—a 500-man battalion square would have been no more than in length on a side."}
{"sequence": "Squares that stood their ground were deadly to cavalry, as cavalry could not engage with soldiers behind a hedge of bayonets, but were themselves vulnerable to fire from the squares."}
{"sequence": "Horses would not charge a square, nor could they be outflanked, but they were vulnerable to artillery or infantry."}
{"sequence": "Wellington ordered his artillery crews to take shelter within the squares as the cavalry approached, and to return to their guns and resume fire as they retreated."}
{"sequence": "Witnesses in the British infantry recorded as many as 12 assaults, though this probably includes successive waves of the same general attack; the number of general assaults was undoubtedly far fewer."}
{"sequence": "Kellermann, recognising the futility of the attacks, tried to reserve the elite \"carabinier\" brigade from joining in, but eventually Ney spotted them and insisted on their involvement."}
{"sequence": "A British eyewitness of the first French cavalry attack, an officer in the Foot Guards, recorded his impressions very lucidly and somewhat poetically: In essence this type of massed cavalry attack relied almost entirely on psychological shock for effect."}
{"sequence": "Close artillery support could disrupt infantry squares and allow cavalry to penetrate; at Waterloo, however, co-operation between the French cavalry and artillery was not impressive."}
{"sequence": "The French artillery did not get close enough to the Anglo-allied infantry in sufficient numbers to be decisive."}
{"sequence": "Artillery fire between charges did produce mounting casualties, but most of this fire was at relatively long range and was often indirect, at targets beyond the ridge."}
{"sequence": "If infantry being attacked held firm in their square defensive formations, and were not panicked, cavalry on their own could do very little damage to them."}
{"sequence": "The French cavalry attacks were repeatedly repelled by the steadfast infantry squares, the harrying fire of British artillery as the French cavalry recoiled down the slopes to regroup, and the decisive countercharges of Wellington's light cavalry regiments, the Dutch heavy cavalry brigade, and the remaining effectives of the Household Cavalry."}
{"sequence": "At least one artillery officer disobeyed Wellington's order to seek shelter in the adjacent squares during the charges."}
{"sequence": "Captain Mercer, who commanded 'G' Troop, Royal Horse Artillery, thought the Brunswick troops on either side of him so shaky that he kept his battery of six nine-pounders in action against the cavalry throughout, to great effect."}
{"sequence": "For reasons that remain unclear, no attempt was made to spike other Anglo-allied guns while they were in French possession."}
{"sequence": "In line with Wellington's orders, gunners were able to return to their pieces and fire into the French cavalry as they withdrew after each attack."}
{"sequence": "After numerous costly but fruitless attacks on the Mont-Saint-Jean ridge, the French cavalry was spent."}
{"sequence": "Their casualties cannot easily be estimated."}
{"sequence": "Senior French cavalry officers, in particular the generals, experienced heavy losses."}
{"sequence": "Four divisional commanders were wounded, nine brigadiers wounded, and one killed—testament to their courage and their habit of leading from the front."}
{"sequence": "Illustratively, Houssaye reports that the \"Grenadiers à Cheval\" numbered 796 of all ranks on 15 June, but just 462 on 19 June, while the Empress Dragoons lost 416 of 816 over the same period."}
{"sequence": "Overall, Guyot's Guard heavy cavalry division lost 47% of its strength."}
{"sequence": "Eventually it became obvious, even to Ney, that cavalry alone were achieving little."}
{"sequence": "Belatedly, he organised a combined-arms attack, using Bachelu's division and Tissot's regiment of Foy's division from Reille's II Corps (about 6,500 infantrymen) plus those French cavalry that remained in a fit state to fight."}
{"sequence": "This assault was directed along much the same route as the previous heavy cavalry attacks (between Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte)."}
{"sequence": "It was halted by a charge of the Household Brigade cavalry led by Uxbridge."}
{"sequence": "The British cavalry were unable, however, to break the French infantry, and fell back with losses from musketry fire."}
{"sequence": "Uxbridge recorded that he tried to lead the Dutch Carabiniers, under Major-General Trip, to renew the attack and that they refused to follow him."}
{"sequence": "Other members of the British cavalry staff also commented on this occurrence."}
{"sequence": "However, there is no support for this incident in Dutch or Belgian sources."}
{"sequence": "Meanwhile, Bachelu's and Tissot's men and their cavalry supports were being hard hit by fire from artillery and from Adam's infantry brigade, and they eventually fell back."}
{"sequence": "Although the French cavalry caused few direct casualties to Wellington's centre, artillery fire onto his infantry squares caused many."}
{"sequence": "Wellington's cavalry, except for Sir John Vandeleur's and Sir Hussey Vivian's brigades on the far left, had all been committed to the fight, and had taken significant losses."}
{"sequence": "The situation appeared so desperate that the Cumberland Hussars, the only Hanoverian cavalry regiment present, fled the field spreading alarm all the way to Brussels."}
{"sequence": "At approximately the same time as Ney's combined-arms assault on the centre-right of Wellington's line, rallied elements of D'Erlon's I Corps, spearheaded by the 13th \"Légère,\" renewed the attack on La Haye Sainte and this time were successful, partly because the King's German Legion's ammunition ran out."}
{"sequence": "However, the Germans had held the centre of the battlefield for almost the entire day, and this had stalled the French advance."}
{"sequence": "With La Haye Sainte captured, Ney then moved skirmishers and horse artillery up towards Wellington's centre."}
{"sequence": "French artillery began to pulverise the infantry squares at short range with canister."}
{"sequence": "The 30th and 73rd Regiments suffered such heavy losses that they had to combine to form a viable square."}
{"sequence": "The success Napoleon needed to continue his offensive had occurred."}
{"sequence": "Ney was on the verge of breaking the Anglo-allied centre."}
{"sequence": "Along with this artillery fire a multitude of French \"tirailleurs\" occupied the dominant positions behind La Haye Sainte and poured an effective fire into the squares."}
{"sequence": "The situation for the Anglo-allies was now so dire that the 33rd Regiment's colours and all of Halkett's brigade's colours were sent to the rear for safety, described by historian Alessandro Barbero as, \"... a measure that was without precedent\"."}
{"sequence": "Wellington, noticing the slackening of fire from La Haye Sainte, with his staff rode closer to it."}
{"sequence": "French skirmishers appeared around the building and fired on the British command as it struggled to get away through the hedgerow along the road."}
{"sequence": "The Prince of Orange then ordered a single battalion of the KGL, the Fifth, to recapture the farm despite the obvious presence of enemy cavalry."}
{"sequence": "Their Colonel, Christian Friedrich Wilhelm von Ompteda obeyed and led the battalion down the slope, chasing off some French skirmishers until French cuirassiers fell on his open flank, killed him, destroyed his battalion and took its colour."}
{"sequence": "A Dutch–Belgian cavalry regiment ordered to charge retreated from the field instead, fired on by their own infantry."}
{"sequence": "Merlen's Light Cavalry Brigade charged the French artillery taking position near La Haye Sainte but were shot to pieces and the brigade fell apart."}
{"sequence": "The Netherlands Cavalry Division, Wellington's last cavalry reserve behind the centre having lost half their strength was now useless and the French cavalry, despite its losses, were masters of the field, compelling the Anglo-allied infantry to remain in square."}
{"sequence": "More and more French artillery was brought forward."}
{"sequence": "A French battery advanced to within 300 yards of the 1/1st Nassau square causing heavy casualties."}
{"sequence": "When the Nassauers attempted to attack the battery they were ridden down by a squadron of cuirassiers."}
{"sequence": "Yet another battery deployed on the flank of Mercer's battery and shot up its horses and limbers and pushed Mercer back."}
{"sequence": "Mercer later recalled, \"The rapidity and precision of this fire was quite appalling."}
{"sequence": "Every shot almost took effect, and I certainly expected we should all be annihilated. ..."}
{"sequence": "The saddle-bags, in many instances were torn from horses' backs ... One shell I saw explode under the two finest wheel-horses in the troop down they dropped\"."}
{"sequence": "French \"tirailleurs\" occupied the dominant positions, especially one on a knoll overlooking the square of the 27th."}
{"sequence": "Unable to break square to drive off the French infantry because of the presence of French cavalry and artillery, the 27th had to remain in that formation and endure the fire of the \"tirailleurs\"."}
{"sequence": "That fire nearly annihilated the 27th Foot, the Inniskillings, who lost two thirds of their strength within that three or four hours."}
{"sequence": "During this time many of Wellington's generals and aides were killed or wounded including Somerset, Canning, de Lancey, Alten and Cooke."}
{"sequence": "The situation was now critical and Wellington, trapped in an infantry square and ignorant of events beyond it, was desperate for the arrival of help from the Prussians."}
{"sequence": "He later wrote, The Prussian IV Corps (Bülow's) was the first to arrive in strength."}
{"sequence": "Bülow's objective was Plancenoit, which the Prussians intended to use as a springboard into the rear of the French positions."}
{"sequence": "Blücher intended to secure his right upon the Châteaux Frichermont using the Bois de Paris road."}
{"sequence": "Blücher and Wellington had been exchanging communications since 10:00 and had agreed to this advance on Frichermont if Wellington's centre was under attack."}
{"sequence": "General Bülow noted that the way to Plancenoit lay open and that the time was 16:30."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon sent Lobau's corps to stop the rest of Bülow's IV Corps proceeding to Plancenoit."}
{"sequence": "The 15th Brigade threw Lobau's troops out of Frichermont with a determined bayonet charge, then proceeded up the Frichermont heights, battering French Chasseurs with 12-pounder artillery fire, and pushed on to Plancenoit."}
{"sequence": "This sent Lobau's corps into retreat to the Plancenoit area, driving Lobau past the rear of the \"Armee Du Nord's\" right flank and directly threatening its only line of retreat."}
{"sequence": "Hiller's 16th Brigade also pushed forward with six battalions against Plancenoit."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon had dispatched all eight battalions of the Young Guard to reinforce Lobau, who was now seriously pressed."}
{"sequence": "The Young Guard counter-attacked and, after very hard fighting, secured Plancenoit, but were themselves counter-attacked and driven out."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon sent two battalions of the Middle/Old Guard into Plancenoit and after ferocious bayonet fighting—they did not deign to fire their muskets—this force recaptured the village."}
{"sequence": "Throughout the late afternoon, the Prussian I Corps (Zieten's) had been arriving in greater strength in the area just north of La Haie."}
{"sequence": "General Müffling, the Prussian liaison to Wellington, rode to meet Zieten."}
{"sequence": "Zieten had by this time brought up the Prussian 1st Brigade (Steinmetz's), but had become concerned at the sight of stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade (Laurens')."}
{"sequence": "These troops appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting to move away from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit."}
{"sequence": "Zieten had also received a direct order from Blücher to support Bülow, which Zieten obeyed, starting to march to Bülow's aid."}
{"sequence": "Müffling saw this movement away and persuaded Zieten to support Wellington's left flank."}
{"sequence": "Müffling warned Zieten that \"The battle is lost if the corps does not keep on the move and immediately support the English army.\""}
{"sequence": "Zieten resumed his march to support Wellington directly, and the arrival of his troops allowed Wellington to reinforce his crumbling centre by moving cavalry from his left."}
{"sequence": "The French were expecting Grouchy to march to their support from Wavre, and when Prussian I Corps (Zieten's) appeared at Waterloo instead of Grouchy, \"the shock of disillusionment shattered French morale\" and \"the sight of Zieten's arrival caused turmoil to rage in Napoleon's army\"."}
{"sequence": "I Corps proceeded to attack the French troops before Papelotte and by 19:30 the French position was bent into a rough horseshoe shape."}
{"sequence": "The ends of the line were now based on Hougoumont on the left, Plancenoit on the right, and the centre on La Haie."}
{"sequence": "Durutte had taken the positions of La Haie and Papelotte in a series of attacks, but now retreated behind Smohain without opposing the Prussian 24th Regiment (Laurens') as it retook both."}
{"sequence": "The 24th advanced against the new French position, was repulsed, and returned to the attack supported by Silesian \"Schützen\" (riflemen) and the F/1st \"Landwehr\"."}
{"sequence": "The French initially fell back before the renewed assault, but now began seriously to contest ground, attempting to regain Smohain and hold on to the ridgeline and the last few houses of Papelotte."}
{"sequence": "The Prussian 24th Regiment linked up with a Highlander battalion on its far right and along with the 13th \"Landwehr\" Regiment and cavalry support threw the French out of these positions."}
{"sequence": "Further attacks by the 13th \"Landwehr\" and the 15th Brigade drove the French from Frichermont."}
{"sequence": "Durutte's division, finding itself about to be charged by massed squadrons of Zieten's I Corps cavalry reserve, retreated from the battlefield."}
{"sequence": "The rest of d'Erlon's I Corps also broke and fled in panic, while to the west the French Middle Guard were assaulting Wellington's centre."}
{"sequence": "The Prussian I Corps then advanced towards the Brussels road, the only line of retreat available to the French."}
{"sequence": "Meanwhile, with Wellington's centre exposed by the fall of La Haye Sainte and the Plancenoit front temporarily stabilised, Napoleon committed his last reserve, the hitherto-undefeated Imperial Guard infantry."}
{"sequence": "This attack, mounted at around 19:30, was intended to break through Wellington's centre and roll up his line away from the Prussians."}
{"sequence": "Although it is one of the most celebrated passages of arms in military history, it had been unclear which units actually participated."}
{"sequence": "It appears that it was mounted by five battalions of the Middle Guard, and not by the grenadiers or chasseurs of the Old Guard."}
{"sequence": "Three Old Guard battalions did move forward and formed the attack's second line, though they remained in reserve and did not directly assault the Anglo-allied line."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon himself oversaw the initial deployment of the Middle and Old Guard."}
{"sequence": "The Middle Guard formed in battalion squares, each about 550 men strong, with the 1st/3rd Grenadiers, led by Generals Friant and Poret de Morvan, on the right along the road, to their left and rear was General Harlet leading the square of the 4th Grenadiers, then the 1st/3rd Chasseurs under General Michel, next the 2nd/3rd Chasseurs and finally the large single square of two battalions of 800 soldiers of the 4th Chasseurs led by General Henrion."}
{"sequence": "Two batteries of Imperial Guard Horse Artillery accompanied them with sections of two guns between the squares."}
{"sequence": "Each square was led by a general and Marshal Ney, mounted on his 5th horse of the day, led the advance."}
{"sequence": "Behind them, in reserve, were the three battalions of the Old Guard, right to left 1st/2nd Grenadiers, 2nd/2nd Chasseurs and 1st/2nd Chasseurs."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon left Ney to conduct the assault; however, Ney led the Middle Guard on an oblique towards the Anglo-allied centre right instead of attacking straight up the centre."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon sent Ney's senior ADC Colonel Crabbé to order Ney to adjust, but Crabbé was unable to get there in time."}
{"sequence": "Other troops rallied to support the advance of the Guard."}
{"sequence": "On the left infantry from Reille's corps that was not engaged with Hougoumont and cavalry advanced."}
{"sequence": "On the right all the now rallied elements of D'Érlon's corps once again ascended the ridge and engaged the Anglo-allied line."}
{"sequence": "Of these, Pégot's brigade broke into skirmish order and moved north and west of La Haye Sainte and provided fire support to Ney, once again unhorsed, and Friant's 1st/3rd Grenadiers."}
{"sequence": "The Guards first received fire from some Brunswick battalions, but the return fire of the grenadiers forced them to retire."}
{"sequence": "Next, Colin Halkett's brigade front line consisting of the 30th Foot and 73rd traded fire but they were driven back in confusion into the 33rd and 69th regiments, Halket was shot in the face and seriously wounded and the whole brigade retreated in a mob."}
{"sequence": "Other Anglo-allied troops began to give way as well."}
{"sequence": "A counterattack by the Nassauers and the remains of Kielmansegge's brigade from the Anglo-allied second line, led by the Prince of Orange, was also thrown back and the Prince of Orange was seriously wounded."}
{"sequence": "General Harlet brought up the 4th Grenadiers and the Anglo-allied centre was now in serious danger of breaking."}
{"sequence": "It was at this critical moment that the Dutch General Chassé engaged the advancing French forces."}
{"sequence": "Chassé's relatively fresh Dutch division was sent against them, led by a battery of Dutch horse-artillery commanded by Captain Krahmer de Bichin."}
{"sequence": "The battery opened a destructive fire into the 1st/3rd Grenadiers' flank."}
{"sequence": "This still did not stop the Guard's advance, so Chassé ordered his first brigade, commanded by Colonel Hendrik Detmers, to charge the outnumbered French with the bayonet; the French grenadiers then faltered and broke."}
{"sequence": "The 4th Grenadiers, seeing their comrades retreat and having suffered heavy casualties themselves, now wheeled right about and retired."}
{"sequence": "To the left of the 4th Grenadiers were the two squares of the 1st/ and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs who angled further to the west and had suffered more from artillery fire than the grenadiers."}
{"sequence": "But as their advance mounted the ridge they found it apparently abandoned and covered with dead."}
{"sequence": "Suddenly 1,500 British Foot Guards under Maitland who had been lying down to protect themselves from the French artillery rose and devastated them with point-blank volleys."}
{"sequence": "The chasseurs deployed to answer the fire, but some 300 fell from the first volley, including Colonel Mallet and General Michel, and both battalion commanders."}
{"sequence": "A bayonet charge by the Foot Guards then broke the leaderless squares, which fell back onto the following column."}
{"sequence": "The 4th Chasseurs battalion, 800 strong, now came up onto the exposed battalions of British Foot Guards, who lost all cohesion and dashed back up the slope as a disorganized crowd with the chasseurs in pursuit."}
{"sequence": "At the crest the chasseurs came upon the battery that had caused severe casualties on the 1st and 2nd/3rd Chasseurs."}
{"sequence": "They opened fire and swept away the gunners."}
{"sequence": "The left flank of their square now came under fire from a heavy formation of British skirmishers, which the chasseurs drove back."}
{"sequence": "But the skirmishers were replaced by the 52nd Light Infantry, led by John Colborne, which wheeled in line onto the chasseurs' flank and poured a devastating fire into them."}
{"sequence": "The chasseurs returned a very sharp fire which killed or wounded some 150 men of the 52nd."}
{"sequence": "The 52nd then charged, and under this onslaught, the chasseurs broke."}
{"sequence": "The last of the Guard retreated headlong."}
{"sequence": "Sauve qui peut\"!\" (\""}
{"sequence": "The Guard is retreating."}
{"sequence": "Every man for himself!\")"}
{"sequence": "Wellington now stood up in Copenhagen's stirrups and waved his hat in the air to signal a general advance."}
{"sequence": "His army rushed forward from the lines and threw themselves upon the retreating French."}
{"sequence": "The surviving Imperial Guard rallied on their three reserve battalions (some sources say four) just south of La Haye Sainte for a last stand."}
{"sequence": "A charge from Adam's Brigade and the Hanoverian \"Landwehr\" Osnabrück Battalion, plus Vivian's and Vandeleur's relatively fresh cavalry brigades to their right, threw them into confusion."}
{"sequence": "Those left in semi-cohesive units retreated towards \"La Belle Alliance\"."}
{"sequence": "The Guard dies, it does not surrender!\")."}
{"sequence": "At about the same time, the Prussian 5th, 14th, and 16th Brigades were starting to push through Plancenoit, in the third assault of the day."}
{"sequence": "The church was by now on fire, while its graveyard—the French centre of resistance—had corpses strewn about \"as if by a whirlwind\"."}
{"sequence": "Five Guard battalions were deployed in support of the Young Guard, virtually all of which was now committed to the defence, along with remnants of Lobau's corps."}
{"sequence": "The key to the Plancenoit position proved to be the Chantelet woods to the south."}
{"sequence": "Pirch's II Corps had arrived with two brigades and reinforced the attack of IV Corps, advancing through the woods."}
{"sequence": "The 25th Regiment's musketeer battalions threw the 1/2e Grenadiers (Old Guard) out of the Chantelet woods, outflanking Plancenoit and forcing a retreat."}
{"sequence": "The Old Guard retreated in good order until they met the mass of troops retreating in panic, and became part of that rout."}
{"sequence": "The Prussian IV Corps advanced beyond Plancenoit to find masses of French retreating in disorder from British pursuit."}
{"sequence": "The Prussians were unable to fire for fear of hitting Wellington's units."}
{"sequence": "This was the fifth and final time that Plancenoit changed hands."}
{"sequence": "French forces not retreating with the Guard were surrounded in their positions and eliminated, neither side asking for nor offering quarter."}
{"sequence": "The French Young Guard Division reported 96 per cent casualties, and two-thirds of Lobau's Corps ceased to exist."}
{"sequence": "The French right, left, and centre had all now failed."}
{"sequence": "The last cohesive French force consisted of two battalions of the Old Guard stationed around \"La Belle Alliance\"; they had been so placed to act as a final reserve and to protect Napoleon in the event of a French retreat."}
{"sequence": "He hoped to rally the French army behind them, but as retreat turned into rout, they too were forced to withdraw, one on either side of \"La Belle Alliance\", in square as protection against Coalition cavalry."}
{"sequence": "Until persuaded that the battle was lost and he should leave, Napoleon commanded the square to the left of the inn."}
{"sequence": "Adam's Brigade charged and forced back this square, while the Prussians engaged the other."}
{"sequence": "As dusk fell, both squares withdrew in relatively good order, but the French artillery and everything else fell into the hands of the Prussian and Anglo-allied armies."}
{"sequence": "The retreating Guards were surrounded by thousands of fleeing, broken French troops."}
{"sequence": "Coalition cavalry harried the fugitives until about 23:00, with Gneisenau pursuing them as far as Genappe before ordering a halt."}
{"sequence": "There, Napoleon's abandoned carriage was captured, still containing of Machiavelli's \"The Prince\", and diamonds left behind in the rush to escape."}
{"sequence": "These diamonds became part of King Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia's crown jewels; one Major Keller of the F/15th received the Pour le Mérite with oak leaves for the feat."}
{"sequence": "By this time 78 guns and 2,000 prisoners had also been taken, including more generals."}
{"sequence": "Other sources agree that the meeting of the commanders took place near \"La Belle Alliance\", with this occurring at around 21:00."}
{"sequence": "Waterloo cost Wellington around 15,000 dead or wounded and Blücher some 7,000 (810 of which were suffered by just one unit: the 18th Regiment, which served in Bülow's 15th Brigade, had fought at both Frichermont and Plancenoit, and won 33 Iron Crosses)."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon's losses were 24,000 to 26,000 killed or wounded and included 6,000 to 7,000 captured with an additional 15,000 deserting subsequent to the battle and over the following days."}
{"sequence": "At 10:30 on 19 June General Grouchy, still following his orders, defeated General Thielemann at Wavre and withdrew in good order—though at the cost of 33,000 French troops that never reached the Waterloo battlefield."}
{"sequence": "Wellington sent describing the battle to England on 19 June 1815; it arrived in London on 21 June 1815 and was published as a \"London Gazette Extraordinary\" on 22 June."}
{"sequence": "Wellington, Blücher and other Coalition forces advanced upon Paris."}
{"sequence": "Napoleon announced his second abdication on 24 June 1815."}
{"sequence": "In the final skirmish of the Napoleonic Wars, Marshal Davout, Napoleon's minister of war, was defeated by Blücher at Issy on 3 July 1815."}
{"sequence": "Allegedly, Napoleon tried to escape to North America, but the Royal Navy was blockading French ports to forestall such a move."}
{"sequence": "He finally surrendered to Captain Frederick Maitland of HMS \"Bellerophon\" on 15 July."}
{"sequence": "There was a campaign against French fortresses that still held out; Longwy capitulated on 13 September 1815, the last to do so."}
{"sequence": "Louis XVIII was restored to the throne of France and Napoleon was exiled to Saint Helena, where he died in 1821."}
{"sequence": "The Treaty of Paris was signed on 20 November 1815."}
{"sequence": "Maitland's 1st Foot Guards, who had defeated the Chasseurs of the Imperial Guard, were thought to have defeated the Grenadiers, although they had only faced Chasseurs of the newly raised Middle Guard."}
{"sequence": "They were nevertheless awarded the title of Grenadier Guards in recognition of their feat and adopted bearskins in the style of the Grenadiers."}
{"sequence": "Britain's Household Cavalry likewise adopted the cuirass in 1821 in recognition of their success against their armoured French counterparts."}
{"sequence": "The effectiveness of the lance was noted by all participants and this weapon subsequently became more widespread throughout Europe; the British converted their first light cavalry regiment to lancers in 1816, their uniforms, of Polish origin, were based on those of the Imperial Guard lancers."}
{"sequence": "Teeth of tens of thousands of dead soldiers were removed by surviving troops, locals or even scavengers who had travelled there from Britain, then used for making denture replacements in Britain and elsewhere."}
{"sequence": "The so-called \"Waterloo teeth\" were in demand because they came from relatively healthy young men."}
{"sequence": "Despite the efforts of scavengers both human and otherwise, human remains could still be seen at Waterloo a year after the battle."}
{"sequence": "Waterloo proved a decisive battle in more than one sense."}
{"sequence": "Every generation in Europe up to the outbreak of the First World War looked back at Waterloo as the turning point that dictated the course of subsequent world history, seeing it in retrospect as the event that ushered in the Concert of Europe, an era characterised by relative peace, material prosperity and technological progress."}
{"sequence": "The battle definitively ended the series of wars that had convulsed Europe, and involved many other regions of the world, since the French Revolution of the early 1790s."}
{"sequence": "It also ended the First French Empire and the political and military career of Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the greatest commanders and statesmen in history."}
{"sequence": "There followed almost four decades of international peace in Europe."}
{"sequence": "No further major conflict occurred until the Crimean War of 1853–1856."}
{"sequence": "Changes to the configuration of European states, as refashioned after Waterloo, included the formation of the Holy Alliance of reactionary governments intent on repressing revolutionary and democratic ideas, and the reshaping of the former Holy Roman Empire into a German Confederation increasingly marked by the political dominance of Prussia."}
{"sequence": "The bicentenary of Waterloo prompted renewed attention to the geopolitical and economic legacy of the battle and to the century of relative transatlantic peace which followed."}
{"sequence": "General Antoine-Henri, Baron Jomini, one of the leading military writers on the Napoleonic art of war, had a number of very cogent explanations of the reasons behind Napoleon's defeat at Waterloo."}
{"sequence": "The Prussian soldier, historian, and theorist Carl von Clausewitz, who as a young colonel had served as chief-of-staff to Thielmann's Prussian III Corps during the Waterloo campaign, expressed the following opinion: Wellington wrote in his dispatch to London, Despite their differences on other matters, discussed at length in Carl von Clausewitz's study of the \"Campaign of 1815\" and \"Wellington's famous 1842 essay\" in reply to it, the Prussian Clausewitz agreed with Wellington on this assessment."}
{"sequence": "Indeed, Clausewitz viewed the battle prior to the Prussian intervention more as a mutually exhausting stalemate than as an impending French victory, with the advantage, if any, leaning towards Wellington."}
{"sequence": "An alternative view is that towards the end of the battle Wellington's Anglo-allied army faced imminent defeat without Prussian help."}
{"sequence": "For example, Parkinson (2000) writes: \"Neither army beat Napoleon alone."}
{"sequence": "But whatever the part played by Prussian troops in the actual moment when the Imperial Guard was repulsed, it is difficult to see how Wellington could have staved off defeat, when his centre had been almost shattered, his reserves were almost all committed, the French right remained unmolested and the Imperial Guard intact. ..."}
{"sequence": "Blücher may not have been totally responsible for victory over Napoleon, but he deserved full credit for preventing a British defeat\"."}
{"sequence": "Steele (2014) writes: \"Blücher's arrival not only diverted vital reinforcements, but also forced Napoleon to accelerate his effort against Wellington."}
{"sequence": "The tide of battle had been turned by the hard-driving Blücher."}
{"sequence": "As his Prussians pushed in Napoleon's flank, Wellington was able to shift to the offensive\"."}
{"sequence": "Some portions of the terrain on the battlefield have been altered from their 1815 appearance."}
{"sequence": "Tourism began the day after the battle, with Captain Mercer noting that on 19 June \"a carriage drove on the ground from Brussels, the inmates of which, alighting, proceeded to examine the field\"."}
{"sequence": "In 1820, the Netherlands' King William I ordered the construction of a monument."}
{"sequence": "The Lion's Mound, a giant artificial hill, was constructed here using of earth taken from the ridge at the centre of the British line, effectively removing the southern bank of Wellington's sunken road."}
{"sequence": "The alleged remark by Wellington about the alteration of the battlefield as described by Hugo was never documented, however."}
{"sequence": "Other terrain features and notable landmarks on the field have remained virtually unchanged since the battle."}
{"sequence": "These include the rolling farmland to the east of the Brussels–Charleroi Road as well as the buildings at Hougoumont, La Haye Sainte, and La Belle Alliance."}
{"sequence": "Apart from the Lion Mound, there are several more conventional but noteworthy monuments throughout the battlefield."}
{"sequence": "A cluster of monuments at the Brussels–Charleroi and Braine L'Alleud–Ohain crossroads marks the mass graves of British, Dutch, Hanoverian and King's German Legion troops."}

{"sequence": "As part of the bicentennial celebration of the battle, in 2015 Belgium minted a two-euro coin depicting the Lion monument over a map of the field of battle."}
{"sequence": "France officially protested against this issue of coins, while the Belgian government noted that the French mint sells souvenir medals at Waterloo."}
{"sequence": "After 180,000 coins were minted but not released, the issue was melted."}
{"sequence": "Instead, Belgium issued an identical commemorative coin in the non-standard value of 2 euros."}
{"sequence": "Legally valid only within the issuing country (but unlikely to circulate) it was minted in brass, packaged, and sold by the Belgian mint for 6 euros."}

{"sequence": "Boomerang A boomerang is a thrown tool, typically constructed as a flat airfoil, that is designed to spin about an axis perpendicular to the direction of its flight."}
{"sequence": "A returning boomerang is designed to return to the thrower."}
{"sequence": "It is well known as a weapon used by some Aboriginal Australian peoples for hunting."}
{"sequence": "Boomerangs have been historically used for hunting, as well as sport and entertainment."}
{"sequence": "They are commonly thought of as an Australian icon, and come in various shapes and sizes."}
{"sequence": "A boomerang is a throwing stick with certain aerodynamic properties, traditionally made of wood, but boomerang-like devices have also been made from bones."}
{"sequence": "Modern boomerangs used for sport may be made from plywood or plastics such as ABS, polypropylene, phenolic paper, or carbon fibre-reinforced plastics."}
{"sequence": "Boomerangs come in many shapes and sizes depending on their geographic or tribal origins and intended function."}
{"sequence": "Many people think of a boomerang as the Australian type, although today there are many types of more easily usable boomerangs, such as the cross-stick, the pinwheel, the tumble-stick, the Boomabird, and many other less common types."}
{"sequence": "An important distinction should be made between returning boomerangs and non-returning boomerangs."}
{"sequence": "Returning boomerangs fly and are examples of the earliest heavier-than-air human-made flight."}
{"sequence": "A returning boomerang has two or more airfoil wings arranged so that the spinning creates unbalanced aerodynamic forces that curve its path so that it travels in an ellipse, returning to its point of origin when thrown correctly."}
{"sequence": "While a throwing stick can also be shaped overall like a returning boomerang, it is designed to travel as straight as possible so that it can be aimed and thrown with great force to bring down the game."}
{"sequence": "Its surfaces are therefore symmetrical and not with the aerofoils that give the returning boomerang its characteristic curved flight."}
{"sequence": "The most recognisable type of the boomerang is the L-shaped returning boomerang; while non-returning boomerangs, throwing sticks (or kylies) were used as weapons, returning boomerangs have been used primarily for leisure or recreation."}
{"sequence": "Returning boomerangs were also used to decoy birds of prey, thrown above the long grass to frighten game birds into flight and into waiting nets."}
{"sequence": "Modern returning boomerangs can be of various shapes or sizes."}
{"sequence": "Just like the hunting boomerang of the Aboriginal Australians, the valari also did not return to the thrower but flew straight."}
{"sequence": "Boomerangs used in competitions have specially designed air-foiling mechanism to enable return, but the hunting Boomerangs are meant to float straight and hit the target."}
{"sequence": "Valaris are made in many shapes and sizes."}
{"sequence": "The history of the valari is rooted in ancient times and evidences can be found in Tamil Sangam literature \"Purananuru\"."}
{"sequence": "The usual form consists of two limbs set at an angle; one is thin and tapering while the other is rounded and is used as a handle."}
{"sequence": "Valaris are usually made of iron which is melted and poured into moulds, although some may have wooden limbs tipped with iron."}
{"sequence": "Alternatively, the limbs may have lethally sharpened edges; special daggers are known as kattari, double-edged and razor sharp, may be attached to some valari."}
{"sequence": "The origin of the term is uncertain."}
{"sequence": "One source asserts that the term entered the language in 1827, adapted from an extinct Aboriginal language of New South Wales, Australia, but mentions a variant, \"wo-mur-rang\", which it dates to 1798."}
{"sequence": "The first recorded encounter with a boomerang by Europeans was at Farm Cove (Port Jackson), in December 1804, when a weapon was witnessed during a tribal skirmish: David Collins listed \"Wo-mur-rāng\" as one of eight Aboriginal \"Names of clubs\" in 1798."}
{"sequence": "but was probably referring to the woomera, which is actually a spear-thrower."}
{"sequence": "An anonymous 1790 manuscript on Aboriginal languages of New South Wales reported \"Boo-mer-rit\" as \"the Scimiter\"."}
{"sequence": "In 1822, it was described in detail and recorded as a \"bou-mar-rang\" in the language of the Turuwal people (a sub-group of the Darug) of the Georges River near Port Jackson."}
{"sequence": "The Turawal used other words for their hunting sticks but used \"boomerang\" to refer to a returning throw-stick."}
{"sequence": "Boomerangs were, historically, used as hunting weapons, percussive musical instruments, battle clubs, fire-starters, decoys for hunting waterfowl, and as recreational play toys."}
{"sequence": "The smallest boomerang may be less than from tip to tip, and the largest over in length."}
{"sequence": "Tribal boomerangs may be inscribed or painted with designs meaningful to their makers."}
{"sequence": "Most boomerangs seen today are of the tourist or competition sort, and are almost invariably of the returning type."}
{"sequence": "Depictions of boomerangs being thrown at animals, such as kangaroos, appear in some of the oldest rock art in the world, the Indigenous Australian rock art of the Kimberly region, which is potentially up to 50,000 years old."}
{"sequence": "Stencils and paintings of boomerangs also appear in the rock art of West Papua, including on Bird's Head Peninsula and Kaimana, likely dating to the Last Glacial Maximum, when lower sea levels led to cultural continuity between Papua and Arnhem Land in Northern Australia."}
{"sequence": "The oldest surviving Australian Aboriginal boomerangs come from a cache found in a peat bog in the Wyrie Swamp of South Australia and date to 10,000 BC."}
{"sequence": "Although traditionally thought of as Australian, boomerangs have been found also in ancient Europe, Egypt, and North America."}
{"sequence": "There is evidence of the use of non-returning boomerangs by the Native Americans of California and Arizona, and inhabitants of southern India for killing birds and rabbits."}
{"sequence": "Some boomerangs were not thrown at all, but were used in hand to hand combat by Indigenous Australians."}
{"sequence": "Ancient Egyptian examples, however, have been recovered, and experiments have shown that they functioned as returning boomerangs."}
{"sequence": "Hunting sticks discovered in Europe seem to have formed part of the Stone Age arsenal of weapons."}
{"sequence": "One boomerang that was discovered in Obłazowa Cave in the Carpathian Mountains in Poland was made of mammoth's tusk and is believed, based on AMS dating of objects found with it, to be about 30,000 years old."}
{"sequence": "In the Netherlands, boomerangs have been found in Vlaardingen and Velsen from the first century BC."}
{"sequence": "King Tutankhamun, the famous Pharaoh of ancient Egypt, who died over 3,300 years ago, owned a collection of boomerangs of both the straight flying (hunting) and returning variety."}
{"sequence": "No one knows for sure how the returning boomerang was invented, but some modern boomerang makers speculate that it developed from the flattened throwing stick, still used by the Australian Aborigines and other indigenous peoples around the world, including the Navajo in North America."}
{"sequence": "A hunting boomerang is delicately balanced and much harder to make than a returning one."}
{"sequence": "The curving flight characteristic of returning boomerangs was probably first noticed by early hunters trying to \"tune\" their throwing sticks to fly straight."}
{"sequence": "It is thought by some that the shape and elliptical flight path of the returning boomerang makes it useful for hunting birds and small animals, or that noise generated by the movement of the boomerang through the air, or, by a skilled thrower, lightly clipping leaves of a tree whose branches house birds, would help scare the birds towards the thrower."}
{"sequence": "It is further supposed by some that this was used to frighten flocks or groups of birds into nets that were usually strung up between trees or thrown by hidden hunters."}
{"sequence": "In southeastern Australia, it is claimed that boomerangs were made to hover over a flock of ducks; mistaking it for a hawk, the ducks would dive away, toward hunters armed with nets or clubs."}
{"sequence": "Traditionally, most boomerangs used by Aboriginal groups in Australia were non-returning."}
{"sequence": "A throwstick thrown nearly horizontally may fly in a nearly straight path and could fell a kangaroo on impact to the legs or knees, while the long-necked emu could be killed by a blow to the neck."}
{"sequence": "Hooked non-returning boomerangs, known as \"beaked kylies\", used in northern Central Australia, have been claimed to kill multiple birds when thrown into a dense flock."}
{"sequence": "Throwsticks are used as multi-purpose tools by today's Aboriginal peoples, and besides throwing could be wielded as clubs, used for digging, used to start friction fires, and are sonorous when two are struck together."}
{"sequence": "Recent evidence also suggests that boomerangs were used as war weapons."}
{"sequence": "Today, boomerangs are mostly used for recreation."}
{"sequence": "There are different types of throwing contests: accuracy of return; Aussie round; trick catch; maximum time aloft; fast catch; and endurance (see below)."}
{"sequence": "The modern sport boomerang (often referred to as a 'boom' or 'rang') is made of Finnish birch plywood, hardwood, plastic or composite materials and comes in many different shapes and colours."}
{"sequence": "Boomerangs have also been suggested as an alternative to clay pigeons in shotgun sports, where the flight of the boomerang better mimics the flight of a bird offering a more challenging target."}
{"sequence": "The modern boomerang is often computer-aided designed with precision airfoils."}
{"sequence": "The number of \"wings\" is often more than 2 as more lift is provided by 3 or 4 wings than by 2."}
{"sequence": "In 1992, German astronaut Ulf Merbold performed an experiment aboard Spacelab that established that boomerangs function in zero gravity as they do on Earth."}
{"sequence": "French Astronaut Jean-François Clervoy aboard Mir repeated this in 1997."}
{"sequence": "In 2008, Japanese astronaut Takao Doi again repeated the experiment on board the International Space Station."}
{"sequence": "Beginning in the later part of the twentieth century, there has been a bloom in the independent creation of unusually designed art boomerangs."}
{"sequence": "These often have little or no resemblance to the traditional historical ones and on first sight some of these objects may not look like boomerangs at all."}
{"sequence": "The use of modern thin plywoods and synthetic plastics have greatly contributed to their success."}
{"sequence": "Designs are very diverse and can range from animal inspired forms, humorous themes, complex calligraphic and symbolic shapes, to the purely abstract."}
{"sequence": "Painted surfaces are similarly richly diverse."}
{"sequence": "Some boomerangs made primarily as art objects do not have the required aerodynamic properties to return."}
{"sequence": "A returning boomerang is a rotating wing."}
{"sequence": "It consists of two or more arms, or wings, connected at an angle; each wing is shaped as an airfoil section."}
{"sequence": "Although it is not a requirement that a boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat."}
{"sequence": "Boomerangs can be made for right- or left-handed throwers."}
{"sequence": "The difference between right and left is subtle, the planform is the same but the leading edges of the aerofoil sections are reversed."}
{"sequence": "A right-handed boomerang makes a counter-clockwise, circular flight to the left while a left-handed boomerang flies clockwise to the right."}
{"sequence": "A falling boomerang starts spinning, and most then fall in a spiral."}
{"sequence": "When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, a boomerang flies in a curved rather than a straight line."}
{"sequence": "When thrown correctly, a boomerang returns to its starting point."}
{"sequence": "As the wing rotates and the boomerang moves through the air, the airflow over the wings creates lift on both \"wings\"."}
{"sequence": "However, during one-half of each blade's rotation, it sees a higher airspeed, because the rotation tip speed and the forward speed add, and when it is in the other half of the rotation, the tip speed subtracts from the forward speed."}
{"sequence": "Thus if thrown nearly upright, each blade generates more lift at the top than the bottom."}
{"sequence": "While it might be expected that this would cause the boomerang to tilt around the axis of travel, because the boomerang has significant angular momentum, the gyroscopic precession causes the plane of rotation to tilt about an axis that is 90 degrees to the direction of flight, causing it to turn."}
{"sequence": "When thrown in the horizontal plane, as with a Frisbee, instead of in the vertical, the same gyroscopic precession will cause the boomerang to fly violently, straight up into the air and then crash."}
{"sequence": "Fast Catch boomerangs usually have three or more symmetrical wings (seen from above), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped similar to a question mark."}
{"sequence": "Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs mostly have one wing considerably longer than the other."}
{"sequence": "This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings help to set up an \"auto-rotation\" effect to maximise the boomerang's hover time in descending from the highest point in its flight."}
{"sequence": "Some boomerangs have turbulators — bumps or pits on the top surface that act to increase the lift as boundary layer transition activators (to keep attached turbulent flow instead of laminar separation)."}
{"sequence": "Boomerangs are generally thrown in unobstructed, open spaces at least twice as large as the range of the boomerang."}
{"sequence": "The flight direction, left or right depends upon the boomerang, not the thrower."}
{"sequence": "A right-handed or left-handed boomerang can be thrown with either hand, but throwing a boomerang with the wrong hand requires a throwing motion that many throwers find awkward."}
{"sequence": "The following technique applies to a right-handed boomerang, the directions are mirrored for a left-handed boomerang."}
{"sequence": "Different boomerang designs have different flight characteristics and are suitable for different conditions."}
{"sequence": "The accuracy of the throw depends on understanding the weight and aerodynamics of that particular boomerang, and the strength, consistency and direction of the wind; from this, the thrower chooses the angle of tilt, the angle against the wind, the elevation of the trajectory, the degree of spin and the strength of the throw."}
{"sequence": "A great deal of trial and error is required to perfect the throw over time."}
{"sequence": "A properly thrown boomerang will travel out parallel to the ground, sometimes climbing gently, perform a graceful, anti-clockwise, circular or tear-drop shaped arc, flatten out and return in a hovering motion, coming in from the left or spiralling in from behind."}
{"sequence": "Ideally, the hover will allow a practiced catcher to clamp their hands shut horizontally on the boomerang from above and below, sandwiching the centre between their hands."}
{"sequence": "The grip used depends on size and shape; smaller boomerangs are held between finger and thumb at one end, while larger, heavier or wider boomerangs with one or two fingers wrapped over the top edge in order to induce a spin."}
{"sequence": "The aerofoil-shaped section must face the inside of the thrower, and the flatter side outwards."}
{"sequence": "It is usually inclined outwards, from a nearly vertical position to 20° or 30°; the stronger the wind, the closer to vertical."}
{"sequence": "The elbow of the boomerang can point forwards or backwards, or it can be gripped for throwing; it just needs to start spinning on the required inclination, in the desired direction, with the right force."}
{"sequence": "The boomerang is aimed to the right of the oncoming wind; the exact angle depends on the strength of the wind and the boomerang itself."}
{"sequence": "Left-handed boomerangs are thrown to the left of the wind and will fly a clockwise flight path."}
{"sequence": "The trajectory is either parallel to the ground or slightly upwards."}
{"sequence": "The boomerang can return without the aid of any wind, but even very slight winds must be taken into account however calm it may seem."}
{"sequence": "Little or no wind is preferable for an accurate throw, light winds up to are manageable with skill."}
{"sequence": "If the wind is strong enough to fly a kite, then it may be too strong without a skilled thrower with a boomerang designed for stability in stronger winds."}
{"sequence": "Gusty days are a great challenge, and the thrower must be keenly aware of the ebb and flow of the wind strength, finding appropriate lulls in the gusts to launch their boomerang."}
{"sequence": "A World Record achievement was made on 3 June 2007 by Tim Lendrum in Aussie Round."}
{"sequence": "Tim scored 96 out of 100, giving him a National Record as well as an equal World Record throwing an \"AYR\" made by expert boomerang maker Adam Carroll."}
{"sequence": "teams from Germany and the United States dominated international competition."}
{"sequence": "The individual World Champion title was won in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2012, and 2016 by Swiss thrower Manuel Schütz."}
{"sequence": "In 1992, 1998, 2006, and 2008 Fridolin Frost from Germany won the title."}
{"sequence": "The team competitions of 2012 and 2014 were won by Boomergang (an international team)."}
{"sequence": "World champions were Germany in 2012 and Japan in 2014 for the first time."}
{"sequence": "Boomergang was formed by individuals from several countries, including the Colombian Alejandro Palacio."}
{"sequence": "In 2016 USA became team world champion."}
{"sequence": "Modern boomerang tournaments usually involve some or all of the events listed below In all disciplines the boomerang must travel at least from the thrower."}
{"sequence": "Throwing takes place individually."}
{"sequence": "The thrower stands at the centre of concentric rings marked on an open field."}
{"sequence": "Events include: \"Non-discipline record\": Smallest Returning Boomerang: Sadir Kattan of Australia in 1997 with long and wide."}
{"sequence": "A boomerang was used to set a Guinness World Record with a throw of by David Schummy on at Murarrie Recreation Ground, Australia."}
{"sequence": "This broke the record set by Erin Hemmings who threw an Aerobie on 14 July 2003 at Fort Funston, San Francisco."}
{"sequence": "Long-distance boomerang throwers aim to have the boomerang go the furthest possible distance while returning close to the throwing point."}
{"sequence": "In competition the boomerang must intersect an imaginary surface defined as an infinite vertical projection of a line centred on the thrower."}
{"sequence": "Outside of competitions, the definition is not so strict, and throwers may be happy simply not to walk too far to recover the boomerang."}
{"sequence": "Long-distance boomerangs are optimised to have minimal drag while still having enough lift to fly and return."}
{"sequence": "For this reason, they have a very narrow throwing window, which discourages many beginners from continuing with this discipline."}
{"sequence": "For the same reason, the quality of manufactured long-distance boomerangs is often non-deterministic."}
{"sequence": "Today's long-distance boomerangs have almost all an \"S\" or \"? –"}
{"sequence": "question mark\" shape and have a beveled edge on both sides (the bevel on the bottom side is sometimes called an undercut)."}
{"sequence": "This is to minimise drag and lower the lift."}
{"sequence": "Lift must be low because the boomerang is thrown with an almost total layover (flat)."}
{"sequence": "Long-distance boomerangs are most frequently made of composite material, mainly fibre glass epoxy composites."}
{"sequence": "The projection of the flight path of long-distance boomerang on the ground resembles a water drop."}
{"sequence": "For older types of long-distance boomerangs (all types of so-called big hooks), the first and last third of the flight path are very low, while the middle third is a fast climb followed by a fast descent."}
{"sequence": "Nowadays, boomerangs are made in a way that their whole flight path is almost planar with a constant climb during the first half of the trajectory and then a rather constant descent during the second half."}
{"sequence": "From theoretical point of view, distance boomerangs are interesting also for the following reason: for achieving a different behaviour during different flight phases, the ratio of the rotation frequency to the forward velocity has a U-shaped function, i.e., its derivative crosses 0."}
{"sequence": "Practically, it means that the boomerang being at the furthest point has a very low forward velocity."}
{"sequence": "The kinetic energy of the forward component is then stored in the potential energy."}
{"sequence": "This is not true for other types of boomerangs, where the loss of kinetic energy is non-reversible (the MTAs also store kinetic energy in potential energy during the first half of the flight, but then the potential energy is lost directly by the drag)."}
{"sequence": "In Noongar language, \"kylie\" is a flat curved piece of wood similar in appearance to a boomerang that is thrown when hunting for birds and animals."}
{"sequence": "\"Kylie\" is one of the Aboriginal words for the hunting stick used in warfare and for hunting animals."}
{"sequence": "Instead of following curved flight paths, kylies fly in straight lines from the throwers."}
{"sequence": "They are typically much larger than boomerangs, and can travel very long distances; due to their size and hook shapes, they can cripple or kill an animal or human opponent."}
{"sequence": "The word is perhaps an English corruption of a word meaning \"boomerang\" taken from one of the Western Desert languages, for example, the Warlpiri word \"karli\"."}
{"sequence": "Trademarks of Australian companies using the boomerang as a symbol, emblem or logo proliferate, usually removed from Aboriginal context and symbolising 'returning' or to distinguish an Australian brand."}
{"sequence": "Early examples included Bain's White Ant Exterminator (1896); Webendorfer Bros. explosives (1898); E. A. Adams Foods (1920); and by the (still current) Boomerang Cigarette Papers Pty."}
{"sequence": "Ltd. \"Aboriginalia\", including the boomerang, as symbols of Australia dates from the late 1940s and early 1950s and was in widespread use by a largely European arts, crafts and design community."}
{"sequence": "By the 1960s, the Australian tourism industry extended it to the very branding of Australia, particularly to overseas and domestic tourists as souvenirs and gifts and thus Aboriginal culture."}
{"sequence": "At the very time when Aboriginal people and culture were subject to policies that removed them from their traditional lands and sought to assimilate them (physiologically and culturally) into mainstream white Australian culture, causing the Stolen Generations, Aboriginalia found an ironically \"nostalgic\", entry point into Australian popular culture at important social locations: holiday resorts and in Australian domestic interiors."}
{"sequence": "In the 21st century, souvenir objects depicting Aboriginal peoples, symbolism and motifs including the boomerang, from the 1940s–1970s, regarded as kitsch and sold largely to tourists in the first instance, became highly sought after by both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal collectors and has captured the imagination of Aboriginal artists and cultural commentators."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilding Bodybuilding is the use of progressive resistance exercise to control and develop one's musculature for aesthetic purposes."}
{"sequence": "An individual who engages in this activity is referred to as a bodybuilder."}
{"sequence": "In professional bodybuilding, competitors appear in lineups and perform specified poses (and later individual posing routines) for a panel of judges who rank them based on symmetry, muscularity, size, conditioning, posing, and stage presentation."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilders prepare for competitions through the elimination of nonessential body fat, enhanced at the last stage by a combination of extracellular dehydration and carbo-loading, to achieve maximum muscular definition and vascularity; they also tan and shave to accentuate the contrast of their skin under the spotlights."}
{"sequence": "Some bodybuilders use anabolic steroids and other performance-enhancing drugs to build muscles and recover from injuries more quickly, but competitions sometimes ban using them because of the health risks or considerations regarding fair competition."}
{"sequence": "Despite some calls for testing for steroids, the leading bodybuilding federation (National Physique Committee) does not."}
{"sequence": "The winner of the annual IFBB Mr. Olympia contest is generally recognized as the world's top male professional bodybuilder."}
{"sequence": "Since 1950, the NABBA Universe Championships have been considered the top amateur bodybuilding contests, with notable winners such as Reg Park, Lee Priest, Steve Reeves, and Arnold Schwarzenegger."}
{"sequence": "Winners generally go on to become professional athletes."}
{"sequence": "Stone-lifting traditions were practiced in ancient Egypt, Greece, and Tamilakam."}
{"sequence": "Western weightlifting developed in Europe from 1880 to 1953, with strongmen displaying feats of strength for the public and challenging each other."}
{"sequence": "The focus was not on their physique, and they often had large bellies and fatty limbs."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilding developed in the late 19th century, promoted in England by German Eugen Sandow, now considered as the \"Father of Modern Bodybuilding\"."}
{"sequence": "He allowed audiences to enjoy viewing his physique in \"muscle display performances\"."}
{"sequence": "Although audiences were thrilled to see a well-developed physique, the men simply displayed their bodies as part of strength demonstrations or wrestling matches."}
{"sequence": "Sandow had a stage show built around these displays through his manager, Florenz Ziegfeld."}
{"sequence": "The Oscar-winning 1936 musical film \"The Great Ziegfeld\" depicts the beginning of modern bodybuilding, when Sandow began to display his body for carnivals."}
{"sequence": "Sandow was so successful at flexing and posing his physique that he later created several businesses around his fame, and was among the first to market products branded with his name."}
{"sequence": "He was credited with inventing and selling the first exercise equipment for the masses: machined dumbbells, spring pulleys, and tension bands."}
{"sequence": "Even his image was sold by the thousands in \"cabinet cards\" and other prints."}
{"sequence": "Sandow was a perfect \"Gracilian\", a standard of ideal body proportions close to those of ancient Greek and Roman statues."}
{"sequence": "Men's physiques were then judged by how closely they matched these proportions."}
{"sequence": "Sandow organized the first bodybuilding contest on September 14, 1901, called the \"Great Competition\"."}
{"sequence": "It was held at the Royal Albert Hall in London."}
{"sequence": "Judged by Sandow, Sir Charles Lawes, and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, the contest was a great success and many bodybuilding enthusiasts were turned away due to the overwhelming amount of audience members."}
{"sequence": "The trophy presented to the winner was a gold statue of Sandow sculpted by Frederick Pomeroy."}
{"sequence": "The winner was William L. Murray of Nottingham."}
{"sequence": "The silver Sandow trophy was presented to second-place winner D. Cooper."}
{"sequence": "The bronze Sandow trophy — now the most famous of all — was presented to third-place winner A.C. Smythe."}
{"sequence": "In 1950, this same bronze trophy was presented to Steve Reeves for winning the inaugural NABBA Mr. Universe contest."}
{"sequence": "It would not resurface again until 1977 when the winner of the IFBB Mr. Olympia contest, Frank Zane, was presented with a replica of the bronze trophy."}
{"sequence": "Since then, Mr. Olympia winners have been consistently awarded a replica of the bronze Sandow."}
{"sequence": "From December 28, 1903 to January 2, 1904, the first large-scale bodybuilding competition in America took place at Madison Square Garden in New York City."}
{"sequence": "The competition was promoted by Bernarr Macfadden, the father of physical culture and publisher of original bodybuilding magazines such as \"Health & Strength\"."}
{"sequence": "The winner was Al Treloar, who was declared \"The Most Perfectly Developed Man in the World\"."}
{"sequence": "Treloar won a $1,000 cash prize, a substantial sum at that time."}
{"sequence": "Two weeks later, Thomas Edison made a film of Treloar's posing routine."}
{"sequence": "Edison had also made two films of Sandow a few years before."}
{"sequence": "Those were the first three motion pictures featuring a bodybuilder."}
{"sequence": "In the early 20th century, Macfadden and Charles Atlas continued to promote bodybuilding across the world."}
{"sequence": "Many other important bodybuilders in the early history of bodybuilding prior to 1930 include: Earle Liederman (writer of some of bodybuilding's earliest books), Zishe Breitbart, Georg Hackenschmidt, Emy Nkemena, George F. Jowett, Finn Hateral (a pioneer in the art of posing), Frank Saldo, Monte Saldo, William Bankier, Launceston Elliot, Sig Klein, Sgt."}
{"sequence": "Alfred Moss, Joe Nordquist, Lionel Strongfort (\"Strongfortism\"), Gustav Frištenský, Ralph Parcaut (a champion wrestler who also authored an early book on \"physical culture\"), and Alan P. Mead (who became an impressive muscle champion despite the fact that he lost a leg in World War I)."}
{"sequence": "Actor Francis X. Bushman, who was a disciple of Sandow, started his career as a bodybuilder and sculptor's model before beginning his famous silent movie career."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilding became more popular in the 1950s and 1960s with the emergence of strength and gymnastics champions, and the simultaneous popularization of bodybuilding magazines, training principles, nutrition for bulking up and cutting down, the use of protein and other food supplements, and the opportunity to enter physique contests."}
{"sequence": "The number of bodybuilding organizations grew, and most notably the International Federation of Bodybuilders (IFBB) was founded in 1946 by Canadian brothers Joe and Ben Weider."}
{"sequence": "Other bodybuilding organizations included the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU), National Amateur Bodybuilding Association (NABBA), and the World Bodybuilding Guild (WBBG)."}
{"sequence": "Consequently, the contests grew both in number and in size."}
{"sequence": "Besides the many \"Mr. XXX\" (insert town, city, state, or region) championships, the most prestigious titles were Mr. America, Mr. World, Mr. Universe, Mr. Galaxy, and ultimately Mr. Olympia, which was started in 1965 by the IFBB and is now considered the most important bodybuilding competition in the world."}
{"sequence": "During the 1950s, the most successful and most famous competing bodybuilders were Bill Pearl, Reg Park, Leroy Colbert, and Clarence Ross."}
{"sequence": "Certain bodybuilders rose to fame thanks to the relatively new medium of television, as well as cinema."}
{"sequence": "The most notable were Jack LaLanne, Steve Reeves, Reg Park, and Mickey Hargitay."}
{"sequence": "While there were well-known gyms throughout the country during the 1950s (such as Vince's Gym in North Hollywood, California and Vic Tanny's chain gyms), there were still segments of the United States that had no \"hardcore\" bodybuilding gyms until the advent of Gold's Gym in the mid-1960s."}
{"sequence": "Finally, the famed Muscle Beach in Santa Monica continued its popularity as the place to be for witnessing acrobatic acts, feats of strength, and the like."}
{"sequence": "The movement grew more in the 1960s with increased TV and movie exposure, as bodybuilders were typecast in popular shows and movies."}
{"sequence": "In the 1970s, bodybuilding had major publicity thanks to the appearance of Arnold Schwarzenegger, Franco Columbu, Lou Ferrigno, and others in the 1977 docudrama \"Pumping Iron\"."}
{"sequence": "By this time, the IFBB dominated the competitive bodybuilding landscape and the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) took a back seat."}
{"sequence": "The National Physique Committee (NPC) was formed in 1981 by Jim Manion, who had just stepped down as chairman of the AAU Physique Committee."}
{"sequence": "The NPC has gone on to become the most successful bodybuilding organization in America and is the amateur division of the IFBB."}
{"sequence": "The late 1980s and early 1990s saw the decline of AAU-sponsored bodybuilding contests."}
{"sequence": "In 1999, the AAU voted to discontinue its bodybuilding events."}
{"sequence": "This period also saw the rise of anabolic steroids in bodybuilding and many other sports."}
{"sequence": "In bodybuilding lore, this is partly attributed to the rise of \"mass monsters\", beginning with Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sergio Oliva, and Lou Ferrigno in the late 1960s and early 1970s, and continuing through the 1980s with Lee Haney, the 1990s with Dorian Yates, Ronnie Coleman, and Markus Rühl, and up to the present day."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilders such as Greg Kovacs attained mass and size never seen previously but were not successful at the pro level."}
{"sequence": "Others were renowned for their spectacular development of a particular body part, like Tom Platz or Paul Demayo for their leg muscles."}
{"sequence": "At the time of shooting \"Pumping Iron\", Schwarzenegger (while never admitting to steroid use until long after his retirement) said that \"you have to do anything you can to get the advantage in competition\"."}
{"sequence": "He would later say that he does not regret using anything."}
{"sequence": "To combat anabolic steroid use and in the hopes of becoming a member of the IOC, the IFBB introduced doping tests for both steroids and other banned substances."}
{"sequence": "Although doping tests occurred, the majority of professional bodybuilders still used anabolic steroids for competition."}
{"sequence": "During the 1970s, the use of anabolic steroids was openly discussed, partly due to the fact they were legal."}
{"sequence": "In the Anabolic Steroid Control Act of 1990, U.S. Congress placed anabolic steroids into Schedule III of the Controlled Substances Act (CSA)."}
{"sequence": "In Canada, steroids are listed under Schedule IV of the \"Controlled Drugs and Substances Act\", enacted by the federal Parliament in 1996."}
{"sequence": "In 1990, professional wrestling promoter Vince McMahon announced that he was forming a new bodybuilding organization named the World Bodybuilding Federation (WBF)."}
{"sequence": "McMahon wanted to bring WWF-style showmanship and bigger prize money to the sport of bodybuilding."}
{"sequence": "A number of IFBB stars were recruited but the roster was never very large and featured the same athletes competing; the most notable winner and first WBF champion was Gary Strydom."}
{"sequence": "McMahon formally dissolved the WBF in July 1992."}
{"sequence": "Reasons for this reportedly included lack of income from the pay-per-view broadcasts of the contests, slow sales of the WBF's magazine \"Bodybuilding Lifestyles\" (later \"WBF Magazine\"), and the expense of paying multiple six-figure contracts while producing two TV shows and a monthly magazine."}
{"sequence": "In 2003, Joe Weider sold Weider Publications to AMI, which owns the \"National Enquirer\"."}
{"sequence": "The position of president of the IFBB was filled by Rafael Santonja following the death of Ben Weider in October 2008."}
{"sequence": "In 2004, contest promoter Wayne DeMilia broke ranks with the IFBB and AMI took over the promotion of the Mr. Olympia contest: in 2017 AMI took the contest outright."}
{"sequence": "In the early 21st century, patterns of consumption and recreation similar to those of the United States became more widespread in Europe and especially in Eastern Europe following the collapse of the Soviet Union."}
{"sequence": "This resulted in the emergence of whole new populations of bodybuilders from former Eastern Bloc states."}
{"sequence": "In the early 2000s, the IFBB was attempting to make bodybuilding an Olympic sport."}
{"sequence": "It obtained full IOC membership in 2000 and was attempting to get approved as a demonstration event at the Olympics, which would hopefully lead to it being added as a full contest."}
{"sequence": "This did not happen and Olympic recognition for bodybuilding remains controversial since many argue that bodybuilding is not a sport."}
{"sequence": "In the modern bodybuilding industry, the term \"professional\" generally means a bodybuilder who has won qualifying competitions as an amateur and has earned a \"pro card\" from their respective organization."}
{"sequence": "Professionals earn the right to compete in competitions that include monetary prizes."}
{"sequence": "A pro card also prohibits the athlete from competing in federations other than the one from which they have received the pro card."}
{"sequence": "Depending on the level of success, these bodybuilders may receive monetary compensation from sponsors, much like athletes in other sports."}
{"sequence": "Due to the growing concerns of the high cost, health consequences, and illegal nature of some steroids, many organizations have formed in response and have deemed themselves \"natural\" bodybuilding competitions."}
{"sequence": "In addition to the concerns noted, many promoters of bodybuilding have sought to shed the \"freakish\" perception that the general public has of bodybuilding and have successfully introduced a more mainstream audience to the sport of bodybuilding by including competitors whose physiques appear much more attainable and realistic."}
{"sequence": "In natural contests, the testing protocol ranges among organizations from lie detectors to urinalysis."}
{"sequence": "Penalties also range from organization to organization from suspensions to strict bans from competition."}
{"sequence": "It is also important to note that natural organizations also have their own list of banned substances and it is important to refer to each organization's website for more information about which substances are banned from competition."}
{"sequence": "There are many natural bodybuilding organizations; some of the larger ones include: MuscleMania, Ultimate Fitness Events (UFE), INBF/WNBF, and INBA/PNBA."}
{"sequence": "These organizations either have an American or worldwide presence and are not limited to the country in which they are headquartered."}
{"sequence": "Due to the number of people who found bodybuilding to be \"too big\" or \"ugly\" and unhealthy, a new category was started in 2013."}
{"sequence": "The first MR."}
{"sequence": "Olympia was Mark Wingson, which was followed by Jeremy Buendia for consecutive years."}
{"sequence": "Like bodybuilding, the federations in which you can compete in are all the same, there is natural and regular as well but the main difference between the two is that men's physique pose in board shorts rather than a traditional posing suit."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilders are much larger than the men physique competitors as well as have an extensive routine when posing while the Physique category only gets judged by the front and back poses."}
{"sequence": "Many of the competitors are not too large and have a bit of a more attainable and aesthetic physique in comparison to bodybuilding."}
{"sequence": "Although this category started off slow, it grew tremendously in the past 5 years, now Men's Physique seems to be the most popular class to be in."}
{"sequence": "This is the middle ground of both Men's Physique and Bodybuilding."}
{"sequence": "The competitors in this category are not nearly as big as bodybuilders but not as small as mens physique competitors."}
{"sequence": "They pose and perform in mens boxer briefs to show off the legs, unlike Mens Physique which hide the legs in board shorts."}
{"sequence": "Classic physique has only been around for 3 years now as it started in 2016."}
{"sequence": "Danny Hester was the first Classic Physique Mr. Olympia and now Chris Bumstead is the 2019 Mr. Olympia."}
{"sequence": "The first U.S. Women's National Physique Championship, promoted by Henry McGhee and held in Canton, Ohio in 1978, is generally regarded as the first true female bodybuilding contest—that is, the first contest where the entrants were judged solely on muscularity."}
{"sequence": "In 1980, the first Ms. Olympia (initially known as the \"Miss\" Olympia), the most prestigious contest for professionals, was held."}
{"sequence": "The first winner was Rachel McLish, who had also won the NPC's USA Championship earlier in the year."}
{"sequence": "The contest was a major turning point for female bodybuilding."}
{"sequence": "McLish inspired many future competitors to start training and competing."}
{"sequence": "It documented the preparation of several women for the 1983 Caesars Palace World Cup Championship."}
{"sequence": "Competitors prominently featured in the film were Kris Alexander, Lori Bowen, Lydia Cheng, Carla Dunlap, Bev Francis, and McLish."}
{"sequence": "At the time, Francis was actually a powerlifter, though she soon made a successful transition to bodybuilding, becoming one of the leading competitors of the late 1980s and early 1990s."}
{"sequence": "In recent years, the related areas of fitness and figure competition have increased in popularity, surpassing that of female bodybuilding, and have provided an alternative for women who choose not to develop the level of muscularity necessary for bodybuilding."}
{"sequence": "McLish would closely resemble what is thought of today as a fitness and figure competitor, instead of what is now considered a female bodybuilder."}
{"sequence": "Fitness competitions also have a gymnastic element to them."}
{"sequence": "E. Wilma Conner competed in the 2011 NPC Armbrust Pro Gym Warrior Classic Championships in Loveland, Colorado, at the age of 75 years and 349 days."}
{"sequence": "In competitive bodybuilding, bodybuilders aspire to present an aesthetically pleasing body on stage."}
{"sequence": "In prejudging, competitors do a series of mandatory poses: the front lat spread, rear lat spread, front double biceps, back double biceps, side chest, side triceps, Most Muscular (men only), abdominals and thighs."}
{"sequence": "Each competitor also performs a personal choreographed routine to display their physique."}
{"sequence": "A posedown is usually held at the end of a posing round, while judges are finishing their scoring."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilders usually spend a lot of time practising their posing in front of mirrors or under the guidance of their coach."}
{"sequence": "In contrast to strongman or powerlifting competitions, where physical strength is paramount, or to Olympic weightlifting, where the main point is equally split between strength and technique, bodybuilding competitions typically emphasize condition, size, and symmetry."}
{"sequence": "Different organizations emphasize particular aspects of competition, and sometimes have different categories in which to compete."}
{"sequence": "The general strategy adopted by most present-day competitive bodybuilders is to make muscle gains for most of the year (known as the \"off-season\") and, approximately 12–14 weeks from competition, lose a maximum of body fat (referred to as \"cutting\") while preserving as much muscular mass as possible."}
{"sequence": "The bulking phase entails remaining in a net positive energy balance (calorie surplus)."}
{"sequence": "The amount of a surplus in which a person remains is based on the person's goals, as a bigger surplus and longer bulking phase will create more fat tissue."}
{"sequence": "The surplus of calories relative to one's energy balance will ensure that muscles remain in a state of anabolism."}
{"sequence": "The cutting phase entails remaining in a net negative energy balance (calorie deficit)."}
{"sequence": "The main goal of cutting is to oxidize fat while preserving as much muscle as possible."}
{"sequence": "The larger the calorie deficit, the faster one will lose weight."}
{"sequence": "However, a large calorie deficit will also create the risk of losing muscle tissue."}
{"sequence": "The bulking and cutting strategy is effective because there is a well-established link between muscle hypertrophy and being in a state of positive energy balance."}
{"sequence": "A sustained period of caloric surplus will allow the athlete to gain more fat-free mass than they could otherwise gain under eucaloric conditions."}
{"sequence": "Some gain in fat mass is expected, which athletes seek to oxidize in a cutting period while maintaining as much lean mass as possible."}
{"sequence": "The attempt to increase muscle mass in one's body without any gain in fat is called clean bulking."}
{"sequence": "Competitive bodybuilders focus their efforts to achieve a peak appearance during a brief \"competition season\"."}
{"sequence": "Clean bulking takes longer and is a more refined approach to achieving the body fat and muscle mass percentage a person is looking for."}
{"sequence": "A common tactic for keeping fat low and muscle mass high is to have higher calorie and lower calorie days to maintain a balance between gain and loss."}
{"sequence": "Many clean bulk diets start off with a moderate amount of carbs, moderate amount of protein, and a low amount of fats."}
{"sequence": "To maintain a clean bulk, it is important to reach calorie goals every day."}
{"sequence": "Macronutrient goals (carbs, fats, and proteins) will be different for each person, but it is ideal to get as close as possible."}
{"sequence": "\"Dirty bulking\" is the process of eating at a massive caloric surplus without trying to figure out the exact amount of ingested macronutrients."}
{"sequence": "Weightlifters who are attempting to gain mass quickly with no aesthetic concerns often choose to use the \"dirty bulk\" method."}
{"sequence": "Many non-competitive bodybuilders choose not to adopt this conventional strategy, as it often results in significant unwanted fat gain during the \"bulking\" phase."}
{"sequence": "In the last week leading up to a contest, bodybuilders usually decrease their consumption of water, sodium, and carbohydrates, the former two to alter how water is retained by the body and the latter to reduce glycogen in the muscle."}
{"sequence": "The day before the show, water is removed from the diet, and diuretics may be introduced, while carbohydrate loading is undertaken to increase the size of the muscles through replenishment of their glycogen."}
{"sequence": "The goal is to maximize leanness and increase the visibility of veins, or \"vascularity\"."}
{"sequence": "The muscular definition and vascularity are further enhanced immediately before appearing on stage by darkening the skin through tanning products and applying oils to the skin to increase shine."}
{"sequence": "Some competitors will eat sugar-rich foods to increase the visibility of their veins."}
{"sequence": "A final step, called \"pumping\", consists in performing exercises with light weights or other kinds of low resistance (for instance two athletes can \"pump\" each other by holding a towel and pulling in turn), just before the contest, to fill the muscles with blood and further increase their size and density."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilders use three main strategies to maximize muscle hypertrophy: Bodybuilders often shorten these three steps into the well-known motto \"eat clean, train hard, sleep well\"."}
{"sequence": "Intensive weight training causes micro-tears to the muscles being trained; this is generally known as microtrauma."}
{"sequence": "These micro-tears in the muscle contribute to the soreness felt after exercise, called delayed onset muscle soreness (DOMS)."}
{"sequence": "It is the repair of these micro-traumas that results in muscle growth."}
{"sequence": "Normally, this soreness becomes most apparent a day or two after a workout."}
{"sequence": "However, as muscles become adapted to the exercises, soreness tends to decrease."}
{"sequence": "Weight training aims to build muscle by prompting two different types of hypertrophy: sarcoplasmic and myofibrillar."}
{"sequence": "Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy leads to larger muscles and so is favored by bodybuilders more than myofibrillar hypertrophy, which builds athletic strength."}
{"sequence": "Sarcoplasmic hypertrophy is triggered by increasing repetitions, whereas myofibrillar hypertrophy is triggered by lifting heavier weight."}
{"sequence": "In either case, there is an increase in both size and strength of the muscles (compared to what happens if that same individual does not lift weights at all), however, the emphasis is different."}
{"sequence": "Many trainees like to cycle between the two methods in order to prevent the body from adapting (maintaining a progressive overload), possibly emphasizing whichever method more suits their goals; typically, a bodybuilder will aim at sarcoplasmic hypertrophy most of the time but may change to a myofibrillar hypertrophy kind of training temporarily in order to move past a plateau."}
{"sequence": "However, no real evidence has been provided to show that trainees ever reach this plateau, and rather was more of a hype created from \"muscular confusion\"."}
{"sequence": "The high levels of muscle growth and repair achieved by bodybuilders require a specialized diet."}
{"sequence": "Generally speaking, bodybuilders require more calories than the average person of the same weight to provide the protein and energy requirements needed to support their training and increase muscle mass."}
{"sequence": "In preparation of a contest, a sub-maintenance level of food energy is combined with cardiovascular exercise to lose body fat."}
{"sequence": "Proteins, carbohydrates and fats are the three major macronutrients that the human body needs in order to build muscle."}
{"sequence": "The ratios of calories from carbohydrates, proteins, and fats vary depending on the goals of the bodybuilder."}
{"sequence": "Carbohydrates play an important role for bodybuilders."}
{"sequence": "They give the body energy to deal with the rigors of training and recovery."}
{"sequence": "Carbohydrates also promote secretion of insulin, a hormone enabling cells to get the glucose they need."}
{"sequence": "Insulin also carries amino acids into cells and promotes protein synthesis."}
{"sequence": "Insulin has steroid-like effects in terms of muscle gains."}
{"sequence": "It is impossible to promote protein synthesis without the existence of insulin, which means that without ingesting carbohydrates or protein—which also induces the release of insulin—it is impossible to add muscle mass."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilders seek out low-glycemic polysaccharides and other slowly digesting carbohydrates, which release energy in a more stable fashion than high-glycemic sugars and starches."}
{"sequence": "This is important as high-glycemic carbohydrates cause a sharp insulin response, which places the body in a state where it is likely to store additional food energy as fat."}
{"sequence": "However, bodybuilders frequently do ingest some quickly digesting sugars (often in form of pure dextrose or maltodextrin) just before, during, and/or just after a workout."}
{"sequence": "This may help to replenish glycogen stored within the muscle, and to stimulate muscle protein synthesis."}
{"sequence": "The motor proteins actin and myosin generate the forces exerted by contracting muscles."}
{"sequence": "Cortisol decreases amino acid uptake by muscle and inhibits protein synthesis."}
{"sequence": "Current recommendations suggest that bodybuilders should consume 25–30% of protein per total calorie intake to further their goal of maintaining and improving their body composition."}
{"sequence": "This is a widely debated topic, with many arguing that 1 gram of protein per pound of body weight per day is ideal, some suggesting that less is sufficient, while others recommending 1.5, 2, or more."}
{"sequence": "It is believed that protein needs to be consumed frequently throughout the day, especially during/after a workout, and before sleep."}
{"sequence": "There is also some debate concerning the best type of protein to take."}
{"sequence": "Chicken, turkey, beef, pork, fish, eggs and dairy foods are high in protein, as are some nuts, seeds, beans, and lentils."}
{"sequence": "Casein or whey are often used to supplement the diet with additional protein."}
{"sequence": "Whey is the type of protein contained in many popular brands of protein supplements and is preferred by many bodybuilders because of its high biological value (BV) and quick absorption rates."}
{"sequence": "Whey protein also has a bigger effect than casein on insulin levels, triggering about double the amount of insulin release."}
{"sequence": "That effect is somewhat overcome by combining casein and whey."}
{"sequence": "Bodybuilders were previously thought to require protein with a higher BV than that of soy, which was additionally avoided due to its alleged estrogenic (female hormone) properties, though more recent studies have shown that soy actually contains phytoestrogens which compete with estrogens in the male body and can block estrogenic actions."}
{"sequence": "Soy, flax, and other plant-based foods that contain phytoestrogens are also beneficial because they can inhibit some pituitary functions while stimulating the liver's P450 system (which eliminates hormones, drugs, and waste from the body) to more actively process and excrete excess estrogen."}
{"sequence": "Some bodybuilders often split their food intake into 5 to 7 meals of equal nutritional content and eat at regular intervals (e.g., every 2 to 3 hours)."}
{"sequence": "This approach serves two purposes: to limit overindulging in the cutting phase, and to allow for the consumption of large volumes of food during the bulking phase."}
{"sequence": "Eating more frequently does not increase basal metabolic rate when compared to 3 meals a day."}
{"sequence": "While food does have a metabolic cost to digest, absorb, and store, called the thermic effect of food, it depends on the quantity and type of food, not how the food is spread across the meals of the day."}
{"sequence": "Well-controlled studies using whole-body calorimetry and doubly labeled water have demonstrated that there is no metabolic advantage to eating more frequently."}
{"sequence": "The important role of nutrition in building muscle and losing fat means bodybuilders may consume a wide variety of dietary supplements."}
{"sequence": "Various products are used in an attempt to augment muscle size, increase the rate of fat loss, improve joint health, increase natural testosterone production, enhance training performance and prevent potential nutrient deficiencies."}
{"sequence": "Some bodybuilders use drugs such as anabolic steroids and precursor substances such as prohormones to increase muscle hypertrophy."}
{"sequence": "Anabolic steroids cause hypertrophy of both types (I and II) of muscle fibers, likely caused by an increased synthesis of muscle proteins."}
{"sequence": "They also provoke undesired side effects including hepatotoxicity, gynecomastia, acne, the early onset of male pattern baldness and a decline in the body's own testosterone production, which can cause testicular atrophy."}
{"sequence": "Other performance-enhancing substances used by competitive bodybuilders include human growth hormone (HGH)."}
{"sequence": "HGH is also used by female bodybuilders to obtain bigger muscles \"while maintaining a 'female appearance'\"."}
{"sequence": "Muscle growth is more difficult to achieve in older adults than younger adults because of biological aging, which leads to many metabolic changes detrimental to muscle growth; for instance, by diminishing growth hormone and testosterone levels."}
{"sequence": "Some recent clinical studies have shown that low-dose HGH treatment for adults with HGH deficiency changes the body composition by increasing muscle mass, decreasing fat mass, increasing bone density and muscle strength, improves cardiovascular parameters, and affects the quality of life without significant side effects."}
{"sequence": "In rodents, knockdown of metallothionein gene expression results in activation of the Akt pathway and increases in myotube size, in type IIb fiber hypertrophy, and ultimately in muscle strength."}
{"sequence": "A recent trend in bodybuilding is to inject synthol into muscles to create larger bulges, or injecting PMMA into muscles to shape them."}
{"sequence": "Use of PMMA to shape muscles is prohibited in the United States."}
{"sequence": "However, it is not illegal to use synthol."}
{"sequence": "Site enhancement oil, often called \"santol\" or \"synthol\" (no relation to the Synthol mouthwash brand), refers to oils injected into muscles to increase the size or change the shape."}
{"sequence": "Some bodybuilders, particularly at the professional level, inject their muscles with such mixtures to mimic the appearance of developed muscle where it may otherwise be disproportionate or lacking."}
{"sequence": "This is known as \"fluffing\"."}
{"sequence": "Synthol is 85% oil, 7.5% lidocaine, and 7.5% alcohol."}
{"sequence": "It is not restricted, and many brands are available on the Internet."}
{"sequence": "The use of injected oil to enhance muscle appearance is common among bodybuilders, despite the fact that synthol can cause pulmonary embolisms, nerve damage, infections, sclerosing lipogranuloma, stroke, and the formation of oil-filled granulomas, cysts or ulcers in the muscle."}
{"sequence": "Rare cases might require surgical intervention to avoid further damage to the muscle and/or to prevent loss of life."}
{"sequence": "Sesame oil is often used in such mixtures, which can cause allergic reactions such as vasculitis."}
{"sequence": "As the injected muscle is not actually well-developed, it might droop under gravity."}
{"sequence": "Although muscle \"stimulation\" occurs in the gym (or home gym) when lifting weights, muscle \"growth\" occurs afterward during rest periods."}
{"sequence": "Without adequate rest and sleep (6 to 8 hours), muscles do not have an opportunity to recover and grow."}
{"sequence": "Additionally, many athletes find that a daytime nap further increases their body's ability to recover from training and build muscles."}
{"sequence": "Some bodybuilders add a massage at the end of each workout to their routine as a method of recovering."}
{"sequence": "Overtraining occurs when a bodybuilder has trained to the point where their workload exceeds their recovery capacity."}
{"sequence": "There are many reasons why overtraining occurs, including lack of adequate nutrition, lack of recovery time between workouts, insufficient sleep, and training at a high intensity for too long (a lack of splitting apart workouts)."}
{"sequence": "Training at a high intensity too frequently also stimulates the central nervous system (CNS) and can result in a hyperadrenergic state that interferes with sleep patterns."}
{"sequence": "To avoid overtraining, intense frequent training must be met with at least an equal amount of purposeful recovery."}
{"sequence": "Timely provision of carbohydrates, proteins, and various micronutrients such as vitamins, minerals, phytochemicals, even nutritional supplements are acutely critical."}
{"sequence": "A mental disorder, informally called \"bigorexia\" (by analogy with anorexia), may account for overtraining in some individuals."}
{"sequence": "Sufferers feel as if they are never big enough or muscular enough, which forces them to overtrain in order to try to reach their goal physique."}
{"sequence": "An article by \"Muscle & Fitness\" magazine, \"Overtrain for Big Gains\", claimed that overtraining for a brief period can be beneficial."}
{"sequence": "Overtraining can be used advantageously, as when a bodybuilder is purposely overtrained for a brief period of time to super compensate during a regeneration phase."}
{"sequence": "These are known as \"shock micro-cycles\" and were a key training technique used by Soviet athletes."}
{"sequence": "Biological warfare Biological warfare (BW)—also known as germ warfare—is the use of biological toxins or infectious agents such as bacteria, viruses, insects, and fungi with the intent to kill or incapacitate humans, animals or plants as an act of war."}
{"sequence": "Biological weapons (often termed \"bio-weapons\", \"biological threat agents\", or \"bio-agents\") are living organisms or replicating entities ( ⁠\"i.e.\""}
{"sequence": "viruses, which are not universally considered \"alive\")."}
{"sequence": "Entomological (insect) warfare is a subtype of BW."}
{"sequence": "Biological warfare is distinct from nuclear warfare, chemical warfare and radiological warfare, which together with biological warfare make up CBRN, the military initialism for nuclear, biological, radiological, and chemical warfare using weapons of mass destruction (WMDs)."}
{"sequence": "None of these are considered conventional weapons, which are deployed primarily for their explosive, kinetic, or incendiary potential."}
{"sequence": "Biological weapons may be employed in various ways to gain a strategic or tactical advantage over the enemy, either by threats or by actual deployments."}
{"sequence": "Like some chemical weapons, biological weapons may also be useful as area denial weapons."}
{"sequence": "These agents may be lethal or non-lethal, and may be targeted against a single individual, a group of people, or even an entire population."}
{"sequence": "They may be developed, acquired, stockpiled or deployed by nation states or by non-national groups."}
{"sequence": "In the latter case, or if a nation-state uses it clandestinely, it may also be considered bioterrorism."}
{"sequence": "Biological warfare and chemical warfare overlap to an extent, as the use of toxins produced by some living organisms is considered under the provisions of both the Biological Weapons Convention and the Chemical Weapons Convention."}
{"sequence": "Toxins and psychochemical weapons are often referred to as \"midspectrum agents\"."}
{"sequence": "Unlike bioweapons, these midspectrum agents do not reproduce in their host and are typically characterized by shorter incubation periods."}
{"sequence": "The use of biological weapons is prohibited under customary international humanitarian law, as well as a variety of international treaties."}
{"sequence": "The use of biological agents in armed conflict is a war crime."}
{"sequence": "Offensive biological warfare, including mass production, stockpiling, and use of biological weapons, was outlawed by the 1972 Biological Weapons Convention (BWC)."}
{"sequence": "The rationale behind this treaty, which has been ratified or acceded to by 170 countries as of April 2013, is to prevent a biological attack which could conceivably result in large numbers of civilian casualties and cause severe disruption to economic and societal infrastructure."}
{"sequence": "Many countries, including signatories of the BWC, currently pursue research into the defense or protection against BW, which is not prohibited by the BWC."}
{"sequence": "A nation or group that can pose a credible threat of mass casualty has the ability to alter the terms under which other nations or groups interact with it."}
{"sequence": "When indexed to weapon mass and cost of development and storage, biological weapons possess destructive potential and loss of life far in excess of nuclear, chemical or conventional weapons."}
{"sequence": "Accordingly, biological agents are potentially useful as strategic deterrents, in addition to their utility as offensive weapons on the battlefield."}
{"sequence": "As a tactical weapon for military use, a significant problem with a BW attack is that it would take days to be effective, and therefore might not immediately stop an opposing force."}
{"sequence": "Some biological agents (smallpox, pneumonic plague) have the capability of person-to-person transmission via aerosolized respiratory droplets."}
{"sequence": "This feature can be undesirable, as the agent(s) may be transmitted by this mechanism to unintended populations, including neutral or even friendly forces."}
{"sequence": "Worse still, such a weapon could \"escape\" the laboratory where it was developed, even if there was no intent to use it – for example by infecting a researcher who then transmits it to the outside world before realizing that they were infected."}
{"sequence": "Several cases are known of researchers becoming infected and dying of Ebola, which they had been working with in the lab (though nobody else was infected in those cases) – while there is no evidence that their work was directed towards BW, it demonstrates the potential for accidental infection even of careful researchers fully aware of the dangers."}
{"sequence": "While containment of BW is less of a concern for certain criminal or terrorist organizations, it remains a significant concern for the military and civilian populations of virtually all nations."}
{"sequence": "Rudimentary forms of biological warfare have been practiced since antiquity."}
{"sequence": "The earliest documented incident of the intention to use biological weapons is recorded in Hittite texts of 1500–1200 BCE, in which victims of tularemia were driven into enemy lands, causing an epidemic."}
{"sequence": "Although the Assyrians knew of ergot, a parasitic fungus of rye which produces ergotism when ingested, there is no evidence that they poisoned enemy wells with the fungus, as has been claimed."}
{"sequence": "Scythian archers dipped their arrows and Roman soldiers their swords into excrements and cadavers – victims were commonly infected by tetanus as result."}
{"sequence": "In 1346, the bodies of Mongol warriors of the Golden Horde who had died of plague were thrown over the walls of the besieged Crimean city of Kaffa."}
{"sequence": "Specialists disagree about whether this operation was responsible for the spread of the Black Death into Europe, Near East and North Africa, resulting in the deaths of approximately 25 million Europeans."}
{"sequence": "Biologicals were extensively used in many parts of Africa from the sixteenth century AD, most of the time in the form of poisoned arrows, or powder spread on the war front as well as poisoning of horses and water supply of the enemy forces."}
{"sequence": "In Borgu, there were specific mixtures to kill, hypnotize, make the enemy bold, and to act as an antidote against the poison of the enemy as well."}
{"sequence": "The creation of biologicals was reserved for a specific and professional class of medicine-men."}
{"sequence": "The British Army attempted use of smallpox against Native Americans during the Siege of Fort Pitt in June 1763."}
{"sequence": "A reported outbreak that began the spring before left as many as one hundred Native Americans dead in Ohio Country from 1763 to 1764."}
{"sequence": "It is not clear, however, whether the smallpox was a result of the Fort Pitt incident or the virus was already present among the Delaware people as outbreaks happened on their own every dozen or so years and the delegates were met again later and seemingly had not contracted smallpox."}
{"sequence": "It is likely that the British Marines used smallpox in New South Wales, Australia, in 1789."}
{"sequence": "Dr Seth Carus (2015) states: \"Ultimately, we have a strong circumstantial case supporting the theory that someone deliberately introduced smallpox in the Aboriginal population.\""}
{"sequence": "By 1900 the germ theory and advances in bacteriology brought a new level of sophistication to the techniques for possible use of bio-agents in war."}
{"sequence": "Biological sabotage in the form of anthrax and glanders was undertaken on behalf of the Imperial German government during World War I (1914–1918), with indifferent results."}
{"sequence": "The Geneva Protocol of 1925 prohibited the use of chemical and biological weapons."}
{"sequence": "With the onset of World War II, the Ministry of Supply in the United Kingdom established a BW program at Porton Down, headed by the microbiologist Paul Fildes."}
{"sequence": "The research was championed by Winston Churchill and soon tularemia, anthrax, brucellosis, and botulism toxins had been effectively weaponized."}
{"sequence": "In particular, Gruinard Island in Scotland, was contaminated with anthrax during a series of extensive tests for the next 56 years."}
{"sequence": "Although the UK never offensively used the biological weapons it developed, its program was the first to successfully weaponize a variety of deadly pathogens and bring them into industrial production."}
{"sequence": "Other nations, notably France and Japan, had begun their own biological weapons programs."}
{"sequence": "When the United States entered the war, Allied resources were pooled at the request of the British, and the U.S. established a large research program and industrial complex at Fort Detrick, Maryland in 1942 under the direction of George W. Merck."}
{"sequence": "The biological and chemical weapons developed during that period were tested at the Dugway Proving Grounds in Utah."}
{"sequence": "Soon there were facilities for the mass production of anthrax spores, brucellosis, and botulism toxins, although the war was over before these weapons could be of much operational use."}
{"sequence": "The most notorious program of the period was run by the secret Imperial Japanese Army Unit 731 during the war, based at Pingfan in Manchuria and commanded by Lieutenant General Shirō Ishii."}
{"sequence": "This unit did research on BW, conducted often fatal human experiments on prisoners, and produced biological weapons for combat use."}
{"sequence": "Although the Japanese effort lacked the technological sophistication of the American or British programs, it far outstripped them in its widespread application and indiscriminate brutality."}
{"sequence": "Biological weapons were used against Chinese soldiers and civilians in several military campaigns."}
{"sequence": "In 1940, the Japanese Army Air Force bombed Ningbo with ceramic bombs full of fleas carrying the bubonic plague."}
{"sequence": "Many of these operations were ineffective due to inefficient delivery systems, although up to 400,000 people may have died."}
{"sequence": "During the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign in 1942, around 1,700 Japanese troops died out of a total 10,000 Japanese soldiers who fell ill with disease when their own biological weapons attack rebounded on their own forces."}
{"sequence": "During the final months of World War II, Japan planned to use plague as a biological weapon against U.S. civilians in San Diego, California, during Operation Cherry Blossoms at Night."}
{"sequence": "The plan was set to launch on 22 September 1945, but it was not executed because of Japan's surrender on 15 August 1945."}
{"sequence": "In Britain, the 1950s saw the weaponization of plague, brucellosis, tularemia and later equine encephalomyelitis and vaccinia viruses, but the programme was unilaterally cancelled in 1956."}
{"sequence": "The United States Army Biological Warfare Laboratories weaponized anthrax, tularemia, brucellosis, Q-fever and others."}
{"sequence": "In 1969, the UK and the Warsaw Pact, separately, introduced proposals to the UN to ban biological weapons, and US President Richard Nixon terminated production of biological weapons, allowing only scientific research for defensive measures."}
{"sequence": "The Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention was signed by the US, UK, USSR, and other nations, as a ban on \"development, production and stockpiling of microbes or their poisonous products except in amounts necessary for protective and peaceful research\" in 1972."}
{"sequence": "However, the Soviet Union continued research and production of massive offensive biological weapons in a program called Biopreparat, despite having signed the convention."}
{"sequence": "As of September 2018, 182 countries have ratified the treaty, and none are proven—though nine are still suspected—to possess offensive BW programs."}
{"sequence": "Biological weapons are difficult to detect, economical and easy to use, making them appealing to terrorists."}
{"sequence": "The cost of a biological weapon is estimated to be about 0.05 percent the cost of a conventional weapon in order to produce similar numbers of mass casualties per kilometer square."}
{"sequence": "Moreover, their production is very easy as common technology can be used to produce biological warfare, like that used in production of vaccines, foods, spray devices, beverages and antibiotics."}
{"sequence": "A major factor in biological warfare that attracts terrorists is that they can easily escape before the government agencies or secret agencies have even started their investigation."}
{"sequence": "This is because the potential organism has an incubation period of 3 to 7 days, after which the results begin to appear, thereby giving terrorists a lead."}
{"sequence": "A technique called Clustered, Regularly Interspaced, Short Palindromic Repeat (CRISPR-Cas9) is now so cheap and widely available that scientists fear that the amateurs will start experimenting with them."}
{"sequence": "In this technique, a DNA sequence is cut off and replaced with a new sequence or code that codes for a particular protein or characteristic, which could potentially show up in the required organism."}
{"sequence": "Though this technique is a breakthrough and is commendable, it can cause serious issues and potential danger if used by people with wrong intentions."}
{"sequence": "Concerns have emerged regarding do-it-yourself biology research organizations due to their associated risk that a rogue amateur DIY researcher could attempt to develop dangerous bioweapons using genome editing technology."}
{"sequence": "In 2002, when CNN went through Al-Qaeda's (AQ's) experiments with crude poisons, they found out that AQ had begun planning ricin and cyanide attacks with the help of a loose association of terrorist cells."}
{"sequence": "The associates had infiltrated many countries like Turkey, Italy, Spain, France and others."}
{"sequence": "In 2015, to combat the threat of bioterrorism, a National Blueprint for Biodefense was issued by the Blue-Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense."}
{"sequence": "Also, 233 potential exposures of select biological agents outside of the primary barriers of the biocontainment in the US were described by the annual report of the Federal Select Agent Program."}
{"sequence": "Though a verification system can reduce bioterrorism, an employee, or a lone terrorist having adequate knowledge of the company facilities, can cause potential danger by injecting a deadly or harmful substance into the facility."}
{"sequence": "Moreover, it has been found that about 95% of accidents that have occurred due to low security have been done by employees or those who had a security clearance."}
{"sequence": "Entomological warfare (EW) is a type of biological warfare that uses insects to attack the enemy."}
{"sequence": "The concept has existed for centuries and research and development have continued into the modern era."}
{"sequence": "EW has been used in battle by Japan and several other nations have developed and been accused of using an entomological warfare program."}
{"sequence": "EW may employ insects in a direct attack or as vectors to deliver a biological agent, such as plague."}
{"sequence": "Essentially, EW exists in three varieties."}
{"sequence": "One type of EW involves infecting insects with a pathogen and then dispersing the insects over target areas."}
{"sequence": "The insects then act as a vector, infecting any person or animal they might bite."}
{"sequence": "Another type of EW is a direct insect attack against crops; the insect may not be infected with any pathogen but instead represents a threat to agriculture."}
{"sequence": "The final method uses uninfected insects, such as bees, wasps, etc.,"}
{"sequence": "to directly attack the enemy."}
{"sequence": "Theoretically, novel approaches in biotechnology, such as synthetic biology could be used in the future to design novel types of biological warfare agents."}
{"sequence": "Most of the biosecurity concerns in synthetic biology, however, are focused on the role of DNA synthesis and the risk of producing genetic material of lethal viruses (e.g. 1918 Spanish flu, polio) in the lab."}
{"sequence": "Recently, the CRISPR/Cas system has emerged as a promising technique for gene editing."}
{"sequence": "It was hailed by The Washington Post as \"the most important innovation in the synthetic biology space in nearly 30 years.\""}
{"sequence": "While other methods take months or years to edit gene sequences, CRISPR speeds that time up to weeks."}
{"sequence": "However, due to its ease of use and accessibility, it has raised a number of ethical concerns, especially surrounding its use in the biohacking space."}
{"sequence": "It has been argued that rational state actors would never use biological weapons offensively."}
{"sequence": "The argument is that biological weapons cannot be controlled: the weapon could backfire and harm the army on the offensive, perhaps having even worse effects than on the target."}
{"sequence": "An agent like smallpox or other airborne viruses would almost certainly spread worldwide and ultimately infect the user's home country."}
{"sequence": "However, this argument does not necessarily apply to bacteria."}
{"sequence": "For example, anthrax can easily be controlled and even created in a garden shed; the FBI suspects it can be done for as little as $2,500 using readily available laboratory equipment."}
{"sequence": "Also, using microbial methods, bacteria can be suitably modified to be effective in only a narrow environmental range, the range of the target that distinctly differs from the army on the offensive."}
{"sequence": "Thus only the target might be affected adversely."}
{"sequence": "The weapon may be further used to bog down an advancing army making them more vulnerable to counterattack by the defending force."}
{"sequence": "Note that these concerns generally do not apply to biologically-derived toxins – while classified as biological weapons, the organism that produces them is not used on the battlefield, so they present concerns similar to chemical weapons."}
{"sequence": "Ideal characteristics of a biological agent to be used as a weapon against humans are high infectivity, high virulence, non-availability of vaccines and availability of an effective and efficient delivery system."}
{"sequence": "Stability of the weaponized agent (the ability of the agent to retain its infectivity and virulence after a prolonged period of storage) may also be desirable, particularly for military applications, and the ease of creating one is often considered."}
{"sequence": "Control of the spread of the agent may be another desired characteristic."}
{"sequence": "The primary difficulty is not the production of the biological agent, as many biological agents used in weapons can be manufactured relatively quickly, cheaply and easily."}
{"sequence": "Rather, it is the weaponization, storage, and delivery in an effective vehicle to a vulnerable target that pose significant problems."}
{"sequence": "For example, \"Bacillus anthracis\" is considered an effective agent for several reasons."}
{"sequence": "First, it forms hardy spores, perfect for dispersal aerosols."}
{"sequence": "Second, this organism is not considered transmissible from person to person, and thus rarely if ever causes secondary infections."}
{"sequence": "A pulmonary anthrax infection starts with ordinary influenza-like symptoms and progresses to a lethal hemorrhagic mediastinitis within 3–7 days, with a fatality rate that is 90% or higher in untreated patients."}
{"sequence": "Finally, friendly personnel and civilians can be protected with suitable antibiotics."}
{"sequence": "Agents considered for weaponization, or known to be weaponized, include bacteria such as \"Bacillus anthracis\", \"Brucella\" spp., \""}
{"sequence": "Burkholderia mallei\", \"Burkholderia pseudomallei\", \"Chlamydophila psittaci\", \"Coxiella burnetii\", \"Francisella tularensis\", some of the Rickettsiaceae (especially \"Rickettsia prowazekii\" and \"Rickettsia rickettsii\"), \"Shigella\" spp., \""}
{"sequence": "Vibrio cholerae\", and \"Yersinia pestis\"."}
{"sequence": "Many viral agents have been studied and/or weaponized, including some of the Bunyaviridae (especially Rift Valley fever virus), Ebolavirus, many of the Flaviviridae (especially Japanese encephalitis virus), Machupo virus, Marburg virus, Variola virus, and yellow fever virus."}
{"sequence": "Fungal agents that have been studied include \"Coccidioides\" spp."}
{"sequence": "Toxins that can be used as weapons include ricin, staphylococcal enterotoxin B, botulinum toxin, saxitoxin, and many mycotoxins."}
{"sequence": "These toxins and the organisms that produce them are sometimes referred to as select agents."}

{"sequence": "The aim was to prevent and minimize the consequences of natural outbreaks of dangerous infectious diseases as well as the threat of alleged use of biological weapons against BTWC States Parties."}
{"sequence": "It is important to note that most classical and modern biological weapons' pathogens can be obtained from a plant or an animal which is naturally infected."}
{"sequence": "Indeed, in the largest biological weapons accident known—the anthrax outbreak in Sverdlovsk (now Yekaterinburg) in the Soviet Union in 1979—sheep became ill with anthrax as far as 200 kilometers from the release point of the organism from a military facility in the southeastern portion of the city and still off-limits to visitors today, (see Sverdlovsk Anthrax leak)."}
{"sequence": "Thus, a robust surveillance system involving human clinicians and veterinarians may identify a bioweapons attack early in the course of an epidemic, permitting the prophylaxis of disease in the vast majority of people (and/or animals) exposed but not yet ill."}
{"sequence": "For example, in the case of anthrax, it is likely that by 24–36 hours after an attack, some small percentage of individuals (those with the compromised immune system or who had received a large dose of the organism due to proximity to the release point) will become ill with classical symptoms and signs (including a virtually unique chest X-ray finding, often recognized by public health officials if they receive timely reports)."}
{"sequence": "The incubation period for humans is estimated to be about 11.8 days to 12.1 days."}
{"sequence": "This suggested period is the first model that is independently consistent with data from the largest known human outbreak."}
{"sequence": "These projections refine previous estimates of the distribution of early-onset cases after a release and support a recommended 60-day course of prophylactic antibiotic treatment for individuals exposed to low doses of anthrax."}
{"sequence": "By making these data available to local public health officials in real time, most models of anthrax epidemics indicate that more than 80% of an exposed population can receive antibiotic treatment before becoming symptomatic, and thus avoid the moderately high mortality of the disease."}

{"sequence": "Book of Nehemiah The Book of Nehemiah, in the Hebrew Bible, largely takes the form of a first-person memoir concerning the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem after the Babylonian exile by Nehemiah, a Jew who is a high official at the Persian court, and the dedication of the city and its people to God's laws (Torah)."}
{"sequence": "Since the 16th century it has generally been treated as a separate book within the Bible."}
{"sequence": "Before that date, it had been included in the Book of Ezra; but in Latin Christian bibles from the 13th century onwards, the Vulgate Book of Ezra was divided into two texts, called respectively the First and Second books of Ezra; a separation which became canonised with the first printed bibles in Hebrew and Latin."}
{"sequence": "Mid 16th century Reformed Protestant bible translations produced in Geneva were the first to introduce the name 'Book of Nehemiah' for the text formerly called the 'Second Book of Ezra'."}
{"sequence": "The events take place in the second half of the 5th century BC."}
{"sequence": "Listed together with the Book of Ezra as Ezra–Nehemiah, it represents the final chapter in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible."}
{"sequence": "The original core of the book, the first-person memoir, may have been combined with the core of the Book of Ezra around 400 BC."}
{"sequence": "Further editing probably continued into the Hellenistic era."}
{"sequence": "The book tells how Nehemiah, at the court of the king in Susa, is informed that Jerusalem is without walls, and resolves to restore them."}
{"sequence": "The king appoints him as governor of Judah and he travels to Jerusalem."}
{"sequence": "There he rebuilds the walls, despite the opposition of Israel's enemies, and reforms the community in conformity with the law of Moses."}
{"sequence": "After 12 years in Jerusalem, he returns to Susa but subsequently revisits Jerusalem."}
{"sequence": "He finds that the Israelites have been backsliding and taking non-Jewish wives, and he stays in Jerusalem to enforce the Law."}
{"sequence": "The book is set in the 5th century BC."}
{"sequence": "Judah is one of several provinces within a larger satrapy (a large administrative unit) within the Achaemenid Empire."}
{"sequence": "The capital of the empire is at Susa."}
{"sequence": "Nehemiah is a cup-bearer to king Artaxerxes I of Persia – an important official position."}
{"sequence": "At his own request Nehemiah is sent to Jerusalem as governor of Yehud, the official Persian name for Judah."}
{"sequence": "Jerusalem had been conquered and destroyed by the Babylonians in 586 BC and Nehemiah finds it still in ruins."}
{"sequence": "His task is to rebuild the walls and to re-populate the city."}
{"sequence": "He faces opposition from three powerful neighbours, the Samaritans, the Ammonites, and the Arabs, as well as the city of Ashdod, but manages to rebuild the walls."}
{"sequence": "He then purifies the Jewish community by enforcing its segregation from its neighbours and enforces the laws of Moses."}
{"sequence": "The single Hebrew book Ezra–Nehemiah, with title \"Ezra\", was translated into Greek around the middle of the 2nd century BC."}
{"sequence": "Slightly later a second, and very different Greek translation was made, in the form of 1 Esdras, from which the deeds of Nehemiah are entirely absent, those sections either being omitted or re-attributed to Ezra instead; and initially early Christians reckoned this later translation as their biblical 'Book of Ezra', as had the 1st century Jewish writer Josephus."}
{"sequence": "From the third century the Christian Old Testament in Greek supplemented the text of 1 Esdras with the older translation of Ezra-Nehemiah, naming the two books Esdras A and Esdras B respectively; and this usage is noted by the early Christian scholar Origen, who remarked that the Hebrew 'book of Ezra' might then be considered a 'double' book."}
{"sequence": "Jerome, writing in the early 5th century, noted that this duplication had since been adopted by Greek and Latin Christians."}
{"sequence": "Jerome himself rejected the duplication in his Vulgate translation of the Bible into Latin from the Hebrew; and consequently all early Vulgate manuscripts present Ezra-Nehemiah as a single book, as too does the 8th century commentary of Bede, and the 9th century bibles of Alcuin and Theodulf of Orleans."}
{"sequence": "However, sporadically from the 9th century onwards, Latin bibles are found that separate the Ezra and Nehemiah sections of Ezra-Nehemiah as two distinct books, then called the first and second books of Ezra; and this becomes standard in the Paris Bibles of the 13th century."}
{"sequence": "It was not until 1516/17, in the first printed Rabbinic Bible of Daniel Bomberg that the separation was introduced generally in Hebrew Bibles."}
{"sequence": "In later medieval Christian commentary, this book is referred to as the 'second book of Ezra', and never as the 'Book of Nehemiah\"; equally citations from this book are always introduced as \"Ezra says..\", and never as 'Nehemiah says..\"."}
{"sequence": "The combined book Ezra–Nehemiah of the earliest Christian and Jewish period was known as Ezra and was probably attributed to Ezra himself; according to a rabbinic tradition, however, Nehemiah was the real author but was forbidden to claim authorship because of his bad habit of disparaging others."}
{"sequence": "The Nehemiah Memorial, chapters 1–7 and 11–13, may have circulated as an independent work before being combined with the Ezra material to form Ezra–Nehemiah."}
{"sequence": "Determining the composition of the Memorial depends on the dates of Nehemiah's mission: It is commonly accepted that \"Artaxerxes\" was Artaxerxes I (there were two later kings of the same name), and that Nehemiah's first period in Jerusalem was therefore 445–433 BC; allowing for his return to Susa and second journey to Jerusalem, the end of the 5th century BC is therefore the earliest possible date for the Memorial."}
{"sequence": "The Nehemiah Memorial is interrupted by chapters 8–10, which concern Ezra."}
{"sequence": "These have sometimes been identified as another, separate work, the Ezra Memorial (EM), but other scholars believe the EM to be fictional and heavily altered by later editors."}
{"sequence": "Both the Nehemiah and Ezra material are combined with numerous lists, Censuses and other material."}

{"sequence": "in citations) is the second of the Latter Prophets in the Hebrew Bible, and the second of the Prophets in the Christian Old Testament."}
{"sequence": "The superscription at chapter Jeremiah 1:1–3 identifies the book as \"the words of Jeremiah son of Hilkiah\"."}
{"sequence": "Of all the prophets, Jeremiah comes through most clearly as a person, ruminating to his scribe Baruch about his role as a servant of God with little good news for his audience."}
{"sequence": "His book is intended as a message to the Jews in exile in Babylon, explaining the disaster of exile as God's response to Israel's pagan worship: the people, says Jeremiah, are like an unfaithful wife and rebellious children, their infidelity and rebelliousness made judgment inevitable, although restoration and a new covenant are foreshadowed."}
{"sequence": "Authentic oracles of Jeremiah are probably to be found in the poetic sections of chapters 1–25, but the book as a whole has been heavily edited and added to by the prophet's followers (including perhaps his companion, the scribe Baruch) and later generations of Deuteronomists."}
{"sequence": "It has come down in two distinct though related versions, one in Hebrew, the other known from a Greek translation."}
{"sequence": "The date of the two (Greek and Hebrew) can be suggested by the fact that the Greek shows concerns typical of the early Persian period, while the Masoretic (i.e., Hebrew) shows perspectives which, although known in the Persian period, did not reach their realisation until the 2nd century BCE."}
{"sequence": "It is difficult to discern any structure in Jeremiah, probably because the book had such a long and complex composition history."}
{"sequence": "It can be divided into roughly six sections: The background to Jeremiah is briefly described in the superscription to the book: Jeremiah began his prophetic mission in the thirteenth year of king Josiah (about 627 BC) and finished in the eleventh year of king Zedekiah (586 BC), \"when Jerusalem went into exile in the sixth month.\""}
{"sequence": "During this period, Josiah changed the Judahite religion, Babylon destroyed Assyria, Egypt briefly imposed vassal status on Judah, Babylon defeated Egypt and made Judah a Babylonian vassal (605 BC), Judah revolted but was subjugated again by Babylon (597 BC), and Judah revolted once more."}
{"sequence": "This revolt was the final one: Babylon destroyed Jerusalem and its Temple and exiled its king and many of the leading citizens in 586 BC, ending Judah's existence as an independent or quasi-independent kingdom and inaugurating the Babylonian exile."}
{"sequence": "The book can be conveniently divided into biographical, prose and poetic strands, each of which can be summarised separately."}
{"sequence": "The biographical material is to be found in chapters 26–29, 32, and 34–44, and focuses on the events leading up to and surrounding the fall of Jerusalem to the Babylonians in 587 BCE; it provides precise dates for the prophet's activities beginning in 609 BCE."}
{"sequence": "The poetic material is found largely in chapters 1–25 and consists of oracles in which the prophet speaks as God's messenger."}
{"sequence": "These passages, dealing with Israel's unfaithfulness to God, the call to repentance, and attacks on the religious and political establishment, are mostly undated and have no clear context, but it is widely accepted that they represent the teachings of Jeremiah and are the earliest stage of the book."}
{"sequence": "Allied to them, and also probably a reflection of the authentic Jeremiah, are further poetic passages of a more personal nature, which have been called Jeremiah's confessions or spiritual diary."}
{"sequence": "In these poems the prophet agonises over the apparent failure of his mission, is consumed by bitterness at those who oppose or ignore him, and accuses God of betraying him."}
{"sequence": "Jeremiah exists in two versions, a Greek translation, called the Septuagint, dating from the last few centuries before Christ and found in the earliest Christian manuscripts, and the Masoretic Hebrew text of traditional Jewish bibles – the Greek version is shorter than the Hebrew by about one eighth, and arranges the material differently."}
{"sequence": "Equivalents of both versions were found among the Dead Sea Scrolls, so that is clear that the differences mark important stages in the transmission of the text."}
{"sequence": "Most scholars hold that the Hebrew text underlying the Septuagint version is older than the Masoretic text, and that the Masoretic evolved either from this or from a closely related version."}
{"sequence": "The shorter version ultimately became canonical in Greek Orthodox churches, while the longer was adopted in Judaism and in Western Christian churches."}
{"sequence": "It is generally agreed that the three types of material interspersed through the book – poetic, narrative, and biographical – come from different sources or circles."}
{"sequence": "Authentic oracles of Jeremiah are probably to be found in the poetic sections of chapters 1–25, but the book as a whole has been heavily edited and added to by followers (including perhaps the prophet's companion, the scribe Baruch) and later generations of Deuteronomists."}
{"sequence": "The date of the final versions of the book (Greek and Hebrew) can be suggested by the fact that the Greek shows concerns typical of the early Persian period, while the Masoretic (i.e., Hebrew) shows perspectives which, although known in the Persian period, did not reach their realisation until the 2nd century BCE."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Jeremiah grew over a long period of time."}
{"sequence": "The Greek stage, looking forward to the fall of Babylon and aligning in places with Second Isaiah, had already seen major redaction (editing) in terms of overall structure, the superscriptions (sentences identifying following passages as the words of God or of Jeremiah), the assignment of historical settings, and arrangement of material, and may have been completed by the late Exilic period (last half of the 6th century BCE); the initial stages of the Masoretic Hebrew version may have been written not long afterwards, although chapter points to a setting in post-exilic times."}
{"sequence": "According to its opening verses the book records the prophetic utterances of the priest Jeremiah son of Hilkiah, \"to whom the word of YHWH came in the days of king Josiah\" and after."}
{"sequence": "Jeremiah lived during a turbulent period, the final years of the kingdom of Judah, from the death of king Josiah (609 BCE) and the loss of independence that followed, through the destruction of Jerusalem by the Babylonians and the exile of much its population (587/586)."}
{"sequence": "The book depicts a remarkably introspective prophet, impetuous and often angered by the role into which he has been thrust, alternating efforts to warn the people with pleads to God for mercy, until he is ordered to \"pray no more for this people.\""}
{"sequence": "He engages in extensive performance art, walking about in the streets with a yoke about his neck and engaging in other efforts to attract attention."}
{"sequence": "He is taunted and retaliates, is thrown in jail as the result, and at one point is thrown into a pit to die."}
{"sequence": "The Deuteronomists were a school or movement who edited the books of Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings into a more or less unified history of Israel (the so-called Deuteronomistic History) during the Jewish exile in Babylon (6th century BCE)."}
{"sequence": "It is argued that the Deuteronomists played an important role in the production of the book of Jeremiah; for example, there is clear Deuteronomistic language in chapter 25, in which the prophet looks back over twenty-three years of unheeded prophecy."}
{"sequence": "From the Deuteronomistic perspective the prophetic role implied, more than anything else, concern with law and covenant after the manner of Moses."}
{"sequence": "On this reading Jeremiah was the last of a long line of prophets sent to warn Israel of the consequences of infidelity to God; unlike the Deuteronomists, for whom the call for repentance was always central, Jeremiah seems at some point in his career to have decided that further intercession was pointless, and that Israel's fate was sealed."}
{"sequence": "The book's superscription claims that Jeremiah was active for forty years, from the thirteenth year of Josiah (627 BCE) to the fall of Jerusalem in 587."}
{"sequence": "It is clear from the last chapters of the book, however, that he continued to speak in Egypt after the assassination of Gedaliah, the Babylonian-appointed governor of Judah, in 582."}
{"sequence": "This suggests that the superscription is trying to make a theological point about Jeremiah by comparing him to Moses – where Moses spent forty years leading Israel from slavery in Egypt to the Promised Land, Jeremiah's forty years saw Israel exiled from the land and Jeremiah himself ultimately in exile in Egypt."}
{"sequence": "Much of Jeremiah's prophetic preaching is based on the theme of the covenant between God and Israel (God would protect the people in return for their exclusive worship of him): Jeremiah insists that the covenant is conditional, and can be broken by Israel's apostasy (worship of gods other than Yahweh, the God of Israel)."}
{"sequence": "The people, says Jeremiah, are like an unfaithful wife and rebellious children: their infidelity and rebelliousness makes judgement inevitable."}
{"sequence": "Interspersed with this are references to repentance and renewal, although it is unclear whether Jeremiah thought that repentance could ward off judgement or whether it would have to follow judgement."}
{"sequence": "The theme of restoration is strongest in chapter 31:32, which looks to a future in which a new covenant made with Israel and Judah, one which will not be broken."}
{"sequence": "This is the theme of the \"new covenant\" passage at chapter 31:31–34, drawing on Israel's past relationship with God through the covenant at Sinai to foresee a new future in which Israel will be obedient to God."}
{"sequence": "In these five passages, Jeremiah expresses his discontent with the message he is to deliver, but also his steadfast commitment to the divine call despite the fact that he had not sought it out."}
{"sequence": "Additionally, in several of these \"confessions\", Jeremiah prays that the Lord will take revenge on his persecutors (for example, )."}
{"sequence": "Jeremiah's \"confessions\" are a type of individual lament."}
{"sequence": "Such laments are found elsewhere in the psalms and the Book of Job."}
{"sequence": "Like Job, Jeremiah curses the day of his birth ( and )."}
{"sequence": "matches exactly."}
{"sequence": "However, Jeremiah's laments are made unique by his insistence that he has been called by Yahweh to deliver his messages."}
{"sequence": "These laments \"provide a unique look at the prophet's inner struggle with faith, persecution, and human suffering\"."}
{"sequence": "Prophetic gestures, also known as sign-acts or symbolic actions, were a form of communication in which a message was delivered by performing symbolic actions."}
{"sequence": "Not unique to the book of Jeremiah, these were often bizarre and violated the cultural norms of the time (e.g. )."}
{"sequence": "They served the purposes of both drawing an audience and causing that audience to ask questions, giving the prophet an opportunity to explain the meaning of the behavior."}
{"sequence": "The recorder of the events in the written text (i.e. the author of the text) had neither the same audience nor, potentially, the same intent that Jeremiah had in performing these prophetic gestures."}
{"sequence": "The following is a list – not exhaustive – of noteworthy sign-acts found in Jeremiah: The influence of Jeremiah during and after the Exile was considerable in some circles, and three additional books, the Book of Baruch, Lamentations, and the Letter of Jeremiah, were attributed to him in Second Temple Judaism (Judaism in the period between the building of the Second Temple in about 515 BCE and its destruction in 70 CE); in the Greek Septuagint they stand between Jeremiah and the Book of Ezekiel, but only Lamentations is included in modern Jewish or Protestant bibles (the Letter of Jeremiah appears in Catholic bibles as the sixth chapter of Baruch)."}
{"sequence": "Jeremiah is mentioned by name in Chronicles and the Book of Ezra, both dating from the later Persian period, and his prophecy that the Babylonian exile would last 70 years was taken up and reapplied by the author of the Book of Daniel in the 2nd century BCE."}
{"sequence": "The Gospel's portrayal of Jesus as a persecuted prophet owes a great deal to the account of Jeremiah's sufferings in chapters 37–44, as well as to the \"Songs of the Suffering Servant\" in Isaiah."}
{"sequence": "It is identified by a superscription as the words of the 8th-century BCE prophet Isaiah ben Amoz, but there is extensive evidence that much of it was composed during the Babylonian captivity and later."}
{"sequence": "After Johann Christoph Döderlein suggested in 1775 that the book contained the works of two prophets separated by more than a century, Bernhard Duhm originated the view, held as a consensus through most of the 20th century, that the book comprises three separate collections of oracles: \"Proto-Isaiah\" (chapters 1–39), containing the words of the 8th century prophet Isaiah; \"Deutero-Isaiah\" (chapters 40–55), the work of an anonymous 6th-century BCE author writing during the Exile; and \"Trito-Isaiah\" (chapters 56–66), composed after the return from Exile."}
{"sequence": "While virtually no scholars today attribute the entire book, or even most of it, to one person, the book's essential unity has become a focus in more recent research."}
{"sequence": "Isaiah 1–33 promises judgment and restoration for Judah, Jerusalem and the nations, and chapters 34–66 presume that judgment has been pronounced and restoration follows soon."}
{"sequence": "It can thus be read as an extended meditation on the destiny of Jerusalem into and after the Exile."}
{"sequence": "The Deutero-Isaian part of the book describes how God will make Jerusalem the centre of his worldwide rule through a royal saviour (a messiah) who will destroy her oppressor (Babylon); this messiah is the Persian king Cyrus the Great, who is merely the agent who brings about Yahweh's kingship."}
{"sequence": "Isaiah speaks out against corrupt leaders and for the disadvantaged, and roots righteousness in God's holiness rather than in Israel's covenant."}
{"sequence": "Isaiah was one of the most popular works among Jews in the Second Temple period (c. 515 BCE – 70 CE)."}
{"sequence": "In Christian circles, it was held in such high regard as to be called \"the Fifth Gospel\", and its influence extends beyond Christianity to English literature and to Western culture in general, from the libretto of Handel's Messiah to a host of such everyday phrases as \"swords into ploughshares\" and \"voice in the wilderness\"."}
{"sequence": "General scholarly consensus through most of the 20th century saw three separate collections of oracles in the book of Isaiah."}
{"sequence": "However, there is not complete unanimity among Biblical scholars, with some still asserting that Isaiah authored the entire book."}
{"sequence": "A typical outline based on this understanding of the book sees its underlying structure in terms of the identification of historical figures who might have been their authors: While one part of the general consensus still holds this perception of Isaiah as made up of three rather distinct sections underwent a radical challenge in the last quarter of the 20th century."}
{"sequence": "The newer approach looks at the book in terms of its literary and formal characteristics, rather than authors, and sees in it a two-part structure divided between chapters 33 and 34: Seeing Isaiah as a two-part book (chapters 1–33 and 34–66) with an overarching theme leads to a summary of its contents like the following: The older understanding of this book as three fairly discrete sections attributable to identifiable authors leads to a more atomised picture of its contents, as in this example: While it is widely accepted that the book of Isaiah is rooted in a historic prophet called Isaiah, who lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the 8th century BCE, it is also widely accepted that this prophet did not write the entire book of Isaiah."}
{"sequence": "The observations which have led to this are as follows: The composition history of Isaiah reflects a major difference in the way authorship was regarded in ancient Israel and in modern societies; the ancients did not regard it as inappropriate to supplement an existing work while remaining anonymous."}
{"sequence": "While the authors are anonymous, it is plausible that all of them were priests, and the book may thus reflect Priestly concerns, in opposition to the increasingly successful reform movement of the Deuteronomists."}
{"sequence": "The historic Isaiah ben Amoz lived in the Kingdom of Judah during the reigns of four kings from the mid to late 8th-century BCE."}
{"sequence": "During this period, Assyria was expanding westward from its origins in modern-day northern Iraq towards the Mediterranean, destroying first Aram (modern Syria) in 734–732 BCE, then the Kingdom of Israel in 722–721, and finally subjugating Judah in 701."}
{"sequence": "Proto-Isaiah is divided between verse and prose passages, and a currently popular theory is that the verse passages represent the prophecies of the original 8th-century Isaiah, while the prose sections are \"sermons\" on his texts composed at the court of Josiah a hundred years later, at the end of the 7th century."}
{"sequence": "The conquest of Jerusalem by Babylon and the exile of its elite in 586 BCE ushered in the next stage in the formation of the book."}
{"sequence": "Deutero-Isaiah addresses himself to the Jews in exile, offering them the hope of return."}
{"sequence": "This was the period of the meteoric rise of Persia under its king Cyrus the Great – in 559 BCE he succeeded his father as ruler of a small vassal kingdom in modern eastern Iran, by 540 he ruled an empire stretching from the Mediterranean to Central Asia, and in 539 he conquered Babylon."}
{"sequence": "Deutero-Isaiah's predictions of the imminent fall of Babylon and his glorification of Cyrus as the deliverer of Israel date his prophecies to 550–539 BCE, and probably towards the end of this period."}
{"sequence": "The Persians ended the Jewish exile, and by 515 BCE the exiles, or at least some of them, had returned to Jerusalem and rebuilt the Temple."}
{"sequence": "The return, however, was not without problems: the returnees found themselves in conflict with those who had remained in the country and who now owned the land, and there were further conflicts over the form of government that should be set up."}
{"sequence": "This background forms the context of Trito-Isaiah."}
{"sequence": "Isaiah is focused on the main role of Jerusalem in God's plan for the world, seeing centuries of history as though they were all the single vision of the 8th-century prophet Isaiah."}
{"sequence": "Proto-Isaiah speaks of Israel's desertion of God and what will follow: Israel will be destroyed by foreign enemies, but after the people, the country and Jerusalem are punished and purified, a holy remnant will live in God's place in Zion, governed by God's chosen king (the messiah), under the presence and protection of God; Deutero-Isaiah has as its subject the liberation of Israel from captivity in Babylon in another Exodus, which the God of Israel will arrange using Cyrus, the Persian conqueror, as his agent; Trito-Isaiah concerns Jerusalem, the Temple, the Sabbath, and Israel's salvation. ("}
{"sequence": "More explicitly, it concerns questions current among Jews living in Jerusalem and Palestine in the post-Exilic period about who is a God-loving Jew and who is not)."}
{"sequence": "Walter Brueggemann has described this overarching narrative as \"a continued meditation upon the destiny of Jerusalem\"."}
{"sequence": "God's plan for the world is based on his choice of Jerusalem as the place where he will manifest himself, and of the line of David as his earthly representative – a theme that may possibly have been created through Jerusalem's reprieve from Assyrian attack in 701 BCE."}
{"sequence": "God is \"the holy one of Israel\"; justice and righteousness are the qualities that mark the essence of God, and Israel has offended God through unrighteousness."}
{"sequence": "Isaiah speaks out for the poor and the oppressed and against corrupt princes and judges, but unlike the prophets Amos and Micah he roots righteousness not in Israel's covenant with God but in God's holiness."}
{"sequence": "Isaiah 44:6 contains the first clear statement of monotheism: \"I am the first and I am the last; beside me there is no God\"."}
{"sequence": "In Isaiah 44:09–20, this is developed into a satire on the making and worship of idols, mocking the foolishness of the carpenter who worships the idol that he himself has carved."}
{"sequence": "While Yahweh had shown his superiority to other gods before, in Second Isaiah, he becomes the sole God of the world."}
{"sequence": "This model of monotheism became the defining characteristic of post-Exilic Judaism and became the basis for Christianity and Islam."}
{"sequence": "A central theme in Second Isaiah is that of a new Exodus – the return of the exiled people Israel from Babylon to Jerusalem."}
{"sequence": "The author imagines a ritualistic return to Zion (Judah) led by Yahweh."}
{"sequence": "The importance of this theme is indicated by its placement at the beginning and end of Second Isaiah (40:3–5, 55:12–13)."}
{"sequence": "This new Exodus is repeatedly linked with Israel's Exodus from Egypt to Canaan under divine guidance, but with new elements."}
{"sequence": "These links include the following: Isaiah was one of the most popular works in the period between the foundation of the Second Temple c. 515 BCE and its destruction by the Romans in 70 CE."}
{"sequence": "Isaiah's \"shoot [which] will come up from the stump of Jesse\" is alluded to or cited in the Psalms of Solomon and various apocalyptic works including the Similitudes of Enoch, 2 Baruch, 4 Ezra, and the third of the Sibylline oracles, all of which understood it to refer to a/the messiah and the messianic age."}
{"sequence": "Isaiah 6, in which Isaiah describes his vision of God enthroned in the Temple, influenced the visions of God in works such as the \"Book of the Watchers\" section of the Book of Enoch, the Book of Daniel and others, often combined with the similar vision from the Book of Ezekiel."}
{"sequence": "A very influential portion of Isaiah was the four so-called Songs of the Suffering Servant from Isaiah 42, 49, 50 and 52, in which God calls upon his servant to lead the nations (the servant is horribly abused, sacrifices himself in accepting the punishment due others, and is finally rewarded)."}
{"sequence": "Some Second Temple texts, including the Wisdom of Solomon and the Book of Daniel identified the Servant as a group – \"the wise\" who \"will lead many to righteousness\" (Daniel 12:3) – but others, notably the Similitudes of Enoch, understood it in messianic terms."}
{"sequence": "The earliest Christians, building on this second tradition, interpreted Isaiah 52:13–53:12, the fourth of the songs, as a prophecy of the death and exaltation of Jesus, a role which Jesus himself accepted according to Luke 4:17–21."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Isaiah has been immensely influential in the formation of Christianity, from the devotion to the Virgin Mary to anti-Jewish polemic, medieval passion iconography, and modern Christian feminism and liberation theology."}
{"sequence": "The regard in which Isaiah was held was so high that the book was frequently called \"the Fifth Gospel\", the prophet who spoke more clearly of Christ and the Church than any others."}
{"sequence": "Its influence extends beyond the Church and Christianity to English literature and to Western culture in general, from the libretto of Handel's Messiah to a host of such everyday phrases as \"swords into ploughshares\" and \"voice in the wilderness\"."}
{"sequence": "The Gospel of John quotes and states that \"Isaiah said this because he saw Jesus' glory and spoke about him.\""}
{"sequence": "where the prophet is assuring king Ahaz that God will save Judah from the invading armies of Israel and Syria, forms the basis for 's doctrine of the virgin birth, while Isaiah 40:3–5's image of the exiled Israel led by God and proceeding home to Jerusalem on a newly constructed road through the wilderness was taken up by all four Gospels and applied to John the Baptist and Jesus."}
{"sequence": "Isaiah seems always to have had a prominent place in Jewish Bible use, and it is probable that Jesus himself was deeply influenced by Isaiah."}
{"sequence": "Thus many of the Isaiah passages that are familiar to Christians gained their popularity not directly from Isaiah but from the use of them by Jesus and the early Christian authors – this is especially true of the Book of Revelation, which depends heavily on Isaiah for its language and imagery."}

{"sequence": "Bilinear map In mathematics, a bilinear map is a function combining elements of two vector spaces to yield an element of a third vector space, and is linear in each of its arguments."}
{"sequence": "Matrix multiplication is an example."}
{"sequence": "Let formula_1 and formula_2 be three vector spaces over the same base field formula_3."}
{"sequence": "A bilinear map is a function such that for all formula_5, the map formula_6 is a linear map from formula_8 to formula_2, and for all formula_10, the map formula_11 is a linear map from formula_13 to formula_2."}
{"sequence": "In other words, when we hold the first entry of the bilinear map fixed while letting the second entry vary, the result is a linear operator, and similarly for when we hold the second entry fixed."}
{"sequence": "Such a map formula_15 satisfies the following properties."}
{"sequence": "If and we have for all \"v\", \"w\" in \"V\", then we say that \"B\" is \"symmetric\"."}
{"sequence": "If \"X\" is the base field \"F\", then the map is called a bilinear form, which are well-studied (see for example scalar product, inner product and quadratic form)."}
{"sequence": "The definition works without any changes if instead of vector spaces over a field \"F\", we use modules over a commutative ring \"R\"."}
{"sequence": "It generalizes to \"n\"-ary functions, where the proper term is \"multilinear\"."}
{"sequence": "For non-commutative rings \"R\" and \"S\", a left \"R\"-module \"M\" and a right \"S\"-module \"N\", a bilinear map is a map with \"T\" an -bimodule, and for which any \"n\" in \"N\", is an \"R\"-module homomorphism, and for any \"m\" in \"M\", is an \"S\"-module homomorphism."}
{"sequence": "This satisfies for all \"m\" in \"M\", \"n\" in \"N\", \"r\" in \"R\" and \"s\" in \"S\", as well as \"B\" being additive in each argument."}
{"sequence": "This may be seen by writing the zero vector 0 as (and similarly for 0) and moving the scalar 0 \"outside\", in front of \"B\", by linearity."}
{"sequence": "The set of all bilinear maps is a linear subspace of the space (viz."}
{"sequence": "vector space, module) of all maps from into \"X\"."}
{"sequence": "Suppose \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" are topological vector spaces and let formula_23 be a bilinear map."}
{"sequence": "Then \"b\" is said to be separately continuous if the following two conditions hold: Many separately continuous bilinear that are not continuous satisfy an additional property: hypocontinuity."}
{"sequence": "All continuous bilinear maps are hypocontinuous."}
{"sequence": "Many bilinear maps that occur in practice are separately continuous but not all are continuous."}
{"sequence": "We list here sufficient conditions for a separately continuous bilinear to be continuous."}
{"sequence": "Let \"X\", \"Y\", and \"Z\" be locally convex Hausdorff spaces and let formula_32 be the composition map defined by formula_33."}
{"sequence": "In general, the bilinear map \"C\" is not continuous (no matter what topologies the spaces of linear maps are given)."}
{"sequence": "We do, however, have the following results: Give all three spaces of linear maps one of the following topologies:"}
{"sequence": "Blind Blake Arthur Blake (1896 – December 1, 1934), known as Blind Blake, was an American blues and ragtime singer and guitarist."}
{"sequence": "He is known for numerous recordings he made for Paramount Records between 1926 and 1932."}
{"sequence": "Little is known of Blake's life."}
{"sequence": "Promotional materials from Paramount Records indicate he was born blind and give his birthplace as Jacksonville, Florida, and it seems that he lived there during various periods."}
{"sequence": "He seems to have had relatives in Patterson, Georgia."}
{"sequence": "Some authors have written that in one recording he slipped into a Geechee or Gullah dialect, suggesting a connection with the Sea Islands."}
{"sequence": "Blind Willie McTell indicated that Blake's real name was Arthur Phelps, but later research has shown this is unlikely to be correct."}
{"sequence": "In 2011 a group of researchers led by Alex van der Tuuk published various documents regarding Blake's life and death in the journal \"Blues & Rhythm\"."}
{"sequence": "One of these documents is his 1934 death certificate, which states he was born in 1896 in Newport News, Virginia, to Winter and Alice Blake (his mother's name is followed by a question mark)."}
{"sequence": "Nothing else is known of Blake until the 1920s, when he emerged as a recording musician."}
{"sequence": "Blake recorded about 80 tracks for Paramount Records from 1926 to 1932."}
{"sequence": "He was one of the most accomplished guitarists of his genre and played a diverse range of material."}
{"sequence": "He is best known for his distinctive guitar playing, which was comparable in sound and style to ragtime piano."}
{"sequence": "He seems to have lived in Jacksonville and to have gone to Chicago for his recording sessions, at one point having an apartment at 31st Street and Cottage Grove Avenue."}
{"sequence": "According to van der Tuuk et al.,"}
{"sequence": "he apparently returned to Florida for the winter."}
{"sequence": "In the 1930s he was reported to be playing in front of a Jacksonville hotel."}
{"sequence": "Blake married Beatrice McGee around 1931."}
{"sequence": "In the following year he made his final recording at the Paramount headquarters, in Grafton, Wisconsin, just before the label went out of business."}
{"sequence": "For decades nothing was known of him after this point, and it was rumored that he met with a violent death; Reverend Gary Davis heard he had been hit by a streetcar in 1934."}
{"sequence": "The research of van der Tuuk et al."}
{"sequence": "suggests that Blake stayed in Wisconsin, living in Milwaukee's Brewer's Hill neighborhood, where Paramount boarded many of its artists."}
{"sequence": "He seems not to have found work as a musician."}
{"sequence": "In April 1933 he was hospitalized with pneumonia and never fully recovered."}
{"sequence": "On December 1, 1934, after three weeks of decline, Beatrice Blake summoned an ambulance."}
{"sequence": "He suffered a pulmonary hemorrhage and died on the way to the hospital."}
{"sequence": "The cause of death was listed as pulmonary tuberculosis."}
{"sequence": "He was buried in Glen Oaks Cemetery, in Glendale, Wisconsin in a previously unmarked grave."}
{"sequence": "Blake's first recordings were made in 1926, and his records sold well."}
{"sequence": "His first solo record was \"Early Morning Blues\", with \"West Coast Blues\" on the B-side."}
{"sequence": "Both are considered excellent examples of his ragtime-based guitar style and were prototypes for the burgeoning Piedmont blues."}
{"sequence": "Blake made his last recordings in 1932; his career ended with Paramount's bankruptcy."}
{"sequence": "Stefan Grossman and Gayle Dean Wardlow have suggested it is possible that only one side of Blake's last record is actually by him; \"Champagne Charlie Is My Name\" does not sound like Blake's playing or singing."}
{"sequence": "His complex and intricate fingerpicking inspired Reverend Gary Davis, Jorma Kaukonen, Ry Cooder, Arlen Roth, John Fahey, Ralph McTell, David Bromberg, Leon Redbone and many others."}
{"sequence": "The track \"You Gonna Quit Me\" from Bob Dylan's 1992 album \"Good As I Been to You\" is a cover of Blind Blake's \"You Gonna Quit Me Blues.\""}

{"sequence": "Brian Lara Brian Charles Lara, (born 2 May 1969) is a Trinidadian former international cricketer, widely acknowledged as one of the greatest batsmen of all time."}
{"sequence": "He topped the Test batting rankings on several occasions and holds several cricketing records, including the record for the highest individual score in first-class cricket, with 501 not out for Warwickshire against Durham at Edgbaston in 1994, which is the only quintuple-hundred in first-class cricket history."}
{"sequence": "Lara also holds the record for the highest individual score in a Test innings after scoring 400 not out against England at Antigua in 2004."}
{"sequence": "Lara also shares the record of scoring the highest number of runs in a single over in a Test match, when he scored 28 runs off an over by Robin Peterson of South Africa in 2003 (matched in 2013 by Australia's George Bailey and in 2020 by South Africa's Keshav Maharaj)."}
{"sequence": "Lara's match-winning performance of 153 not out against Australia in Bridgetown, Barbados in 1999 has been rated by Wisden as the second-best batting performance in the history of Test cricket, next only to the 270 runs scored by Sir Donald Bradman in The Ashes Test match of 1937."}
{"sequence": "Lara was awarded the Wisden Leading Cricketer in the World awards in 1994 and 1995 and is also one of only three cricketers to receive the prestigious BBC Overseas Sports Personality of the Year, the other two being Sir Garfield Sobers and Shane Warne."}
{"sequence": "Brian Lara was appointed honorary member of the Order of Australia on 27 November 2009."}
{"sequence": "On 14 September 2012 he was inducted to the ICC's Hall of Fame at the awards ceremony held in Colombo, Sri Lanka as a 2012–13 season inductee along with Australians Glenn McGrath and former England women all-rounder Enid Bakewell."}
{"sequence": "In 2013, Lara received Honorary Life Membership of the MCC becoming the 31st West Indian to receive the honor."}
{"sequence": "Brian Lara is popularly nicknamed as \"The Prince of Port of Spain\" or simply \"The Prince\"."}
{"sequence": "He has the dubious distinction of playing in the second-highest number of test matches (63) in which his team was on the losing side, just behind Shivnarine Chanderpaul (68)."}
{"sequence": "Brian is one of eleven siblings."}
{"sequence": "His father Bunty and one of his older sisters Agnes Cyrus enrolled him in the local Harvard Coaching Clinic at the age of six for weekly coaching sessions on Sundays."}
{"sequence": "As a result, Lara had a very early education in correct batting technique."}
{"sequence": "Lara's first school was St. Joseph's Roman Catholic primary."}
{"sequence": "He then went to San Juan Secondary School, which is located on Moreau Road, Lower Santa Cruz."}
{"sequence": "A year later, at fourteen years old, he moved on to Fatima College where he started his development as a promising young player under cricket coach Harry Ramdass."}
{"sequence": "Aged 14, he amassed 745 runs in the schoolboys' league, with an average of 126.16 per innings, which earned him selection for the Trinidad national under-16 team."}
{"sequence": "When he was 15 years old, he played in his first West Indian under-19 youth tournament and that same year, Lara represented West Indies in Under-19 cricket."}
{"sequence": "1987 was a breakthrough year for Lara, when in the West Indies Youth Championships he scored 498 runs breaking the record of 480 by Carl Hooper set the previous year."}
{"sequence": "He captained the tournament-winning Trinidad and Tobago, who profited from a match-winning 116 from Lara."}
{"sequence": "In January 1988, Lara made his first-class debut for Trinidad and Tobago in the Red Stripe Cup against Leeward Islands."}
{"sequence": "In his second first-class match he made 92 against a Barbados attack containing Joel Garner and Malcolm Marshall, two greats of West Indies teams."}
{"sequence": "Later in the same year, he captained the West Indies team in Australia for the Bicentennial Youth World Cup where the West Indies reached the semi-finals."}
{"sequence": "Later that year, his innings of 182 as captain of the West Indies Under-23s against the touring Indian team further elevated his reputation."}
{"sequence": "His first selection for the full West Indies team followed in due course, but unfortunately coincided with the death of his father and Lara withdrew from the team."}
{"sequence": "In 1989, he captained a West Indies B Team in Zimbabwe and scored 145."}
{"sequence": "In 1990, at the age of 20, Lara became Trinidad and Tobago's youngest-ever captain, leading them that season to victory in the one-day Geddes Grant Shield."}

{"sequence": "Earlier in that season Lara scored six centuries in seven innings while playing for Warwickshire."}
{"sequence": "He is the only man to have reclaimed the Test record score, having scored 375 against England in 1994, a record that stood until Matthew Hayden's 380 against Zimbabwe in 2003."}
{"sequence": "His 400 not out also made him the second player (after Donald Bradman) to score two Test triple-centuries, and the second (after Bill Ponsford) to score two first-class quadruple-centuries."}
{"sequence": "He has scored nine double-centuries in Test cricket, third after Bradman's twelve and Kumar Sangakkara's eleven."}
{"sequence": "As a captain, he scored five double-centuries, which is the highest by any one who is in charge."}
{"sequence": "In 1995 Lara in the Test match away series against England, scored 3 hundreds in three consecutive Matches which earned him the Man of the Series award."}
{"sequence": "The Test Series was eventually drawn 2–2."}

{"sequence": "That same year Lara amassed 688 runs in the three match away Test series against Sri Lanka making three centuries, and one fifty—including the double-century and a century in the first and second innings of the 3rd Test match at the Sinhalese Sports Ground, equating to 42% of the team's runs in that series."}
{"sequence": "These extraordinary performances led Muttiah Muralitharan to state that Lara was the most dangerous batsman he had ever bowled to."}

{"sequence": "Beagle The beagle is a breed of small hound that is similar in appearance to the much larger foxhound."}
{"sequence": "The beagle is a scent hound, developed primarily for hunting hare (beagling)."}
{"sequence": "Possessing a great sense of smell and superior tracking instincts, the beagle is the primary breed used as detection dogs for prohibited agricultural imports and foodstuffs in quarantine around the world."}
{"sequence": "The beagle is intelligent."}
{"sequence": "It is a popular pet due to its size, good temper, and a lack of inherited health problems."}
{"sequence": "The modern breed was developed in Great Britain around the 1830s from several breeds, including the Talbot Hound, the North Country Beagle, the Southern Hound, and possibly the Harrier."}
{"sequence": "Beagles have been depicted in popular culture since Elizabethan times in literature and paintings, and more recently in film, television, and comic books."}
{"sequence": "The origin of the beagle is not known."}
{"sequence": "In the 11th century, William the Conqueror brought the St. Hubert Hound and the Talbot hound to Britain."}
{"sequence": "In Britain both of these strains were then crossed with Greyhounds to give them speed and stamina for deer hunting."}
{"sequence": "Beagles are similar to the Harrier and the extinct Southern Hound, though smaller and slower."}
{"sequence": "From medieval times, \"beagle\" was used as a generic description for the smaller hounds, though these dogs differed considerably from the modern breed."}
{"sequence": "Miniature breeds of beagle-type dogs were known from the times of Edward II and Henry VII, who both had packs of Glove Beagles, so named since they were small enough to fit on a glove, and Queen Elizabeth I kept a breed known as a Pocket Beagle, which stood at the shoulder."}
{"sequence": "Small enough to fit in a \"pocket\" or saddlebag, they rode along on the hunt."}
{"sequence": "The larger hounds would run the prey to ground, then the hunters would release the small dogs to continue the chase through underbrush."}
{"sequence": "Elizabeth I referred to the dogs as her \"singing beagles\" and often entertained guests at her royal table by letting her Pocket Beagles cavort amid their plates and cups."}
{"sequence": "19th-century sources refer to these breeds interchangeably and it is possible that the two names refer to the same small variety."}
{"sequence": "In George Jesse's \"Researches into the History of the British Dog\" from 1866, the early 17th-century poet and writer Gervase Markham is quoted referring to the beagle as small enough to sit on a man's hand and to the: Standards for the Pocket Beagle were drawn up as late as 1901; these genetic lines are now extinct, although modern breeders have attempted to recreate the variety."}
{"sequence": "By the 18th century two breeds had been developed for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle (or Northern Hound)."}
{"sequence": "The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy dog with a square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably closely related to the Talbot Hound."}
{"sequence": "Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability."}
{"sequence": "The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties."}
{"sequence": "It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle."}
{"sequence": "It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed."}
{"sequence": "Reverend Phillip Honeywood established a beagle pack in Essex in the 1830s and it is believed that this pack formed the basis for the modern breed."}
{"sequence": "Although details of the pack's lineage are not recorded it is thought that North Country Beagles and Southern Hounds were strongly represented; William Youatt suspected that Harriers formed a good majority of the beagle's bloodline, but the origin of the Harrier is itself obscure."}
{"sequence": "Honeywood's Beagles were small, standing at about at the shoulder, and pure white according to John Mills (writing in \"The Sportsman's Library\" in 1845)."}
{"sequence": "Prince Albert and Lord Winterton also had Beagle packs around this time, and royal favor no doubt led to some revival of interest in the breed, but Honeywood's pack was regarded as the finest of the three."}
{"sequence": "Although credited with the development of the modern breed, Honeywood concentrated on producing dogs for hunting and it was left to Thomas Johnson to refine the breeding to produce dogs that were both attractive and capable hunters."}
{"sequence": "Two strains were developed: the rough- and smooth-coated varieties."}
{"sequence": "The rough-coated beagle survived until the beginning of the 20th century, and there were even records of one making an appearance at a dog show as late as 1969, but this variety is now extinct, having probably been absorbed into the standard beagle bloodline."}
{"sequence": "In the 1840s, a standard beagle type was beginning to develop; the distinction between the North Country Beagle and Southern Hound had been lost, but there was still a large variation in size, character, and reliability among the emerging packs."}
{"sequence": "In 1856, \"Stonehenge\" (the pseudonym of John Henry Walsh), writing in the \"Manual of British Rural Sports\", was still dividing beagles into four varieties: the medium beagle; the dwarf or lapdog beagle; the fox beagle (a smaller, slower version of the Foxhound); and the rough-coated or terrier beagle, which he classified as a cross between any of the other varieties and one of the Scottish terrier breeds."}
{"sequence": "Stonehenge also gives the start of a standard description: By 1887 the threat of extinction was on the wane: there were 18 beagle packs in England."}
{"sequence": "The Beagle Club was formed in 1890 and the first standard drawn up at the same time."}
{"sequence": "The following year the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles was formed."}
{"sequence": "Both organisations aimed to further the best interests of the breed, and both were keen to produce a standard type of beagle."}
{"sequence": "By 1902, the number of packs had risen to 44."}
{"sequence": "Beagles were in the United States by the 1840s at the latest, but the first dogs were imported strictly for hunting and were of variable quality."}
{"sequence": "Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these dogs were representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has little resemblance to the standard."}
{"sequence": "Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding."}
{"sequence": "Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887."}
{"sequence": "The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885."}
{"sequence": "In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide."}
{"sequence": "On its formation, the Association of Masters of Harriers and Beagles took over the running of a regular show at Peterborough that had started in 1889, and the Beagle Club in the UK held its first show in 1896."}
{"sequence": "The regular showing of the breed led to the development of a uniform type, and the beagle continued to prove a success up until the outbreak of World War I when all shows were suspended."}
{"sequence": "After the war, the breed was again struggling for survival in the UK: the last of the Pocket Beagles was probably lost during this time, and registrations fell to an all-time low."}
{"sequence": "A few breeders (notably Reynalton Kennels) managed to revive interest in the dog and by World War II, the breed was once again doing well."}
{"sequence": "Registrations dropped again after the end of the war but almost immediately recovered."}
{"sequence": "As purebred dogs, beagles have always been more popular in the United States and Canada than in their native country England."}
{"sequence": "The National Beagle Club of America was formed in 1888 and by 1901 a beagle had won a Best in Show title."}
{"sequence": "As in the UK, activity during World War I was minimal, but the breed showed a much stronger revival in the U.S. when hostilities ceased."}
{"sequence": "In 1928 it won a number of prizes at the Westminster Kennel Club's show and by 1939 a beagle – Champion Meadowlark Draughtsman – had captured the title of top-winning American-bred dog for the year."}
{"sequence": "On 12 February 2008, a beagle, K-Run's Park Me In First (Uno), won the Best In Show category at the Westminster Kennel Club show for the first time in the competition's history."}
{"sequence": "In North America they have been consistently in the top-ten most-popular breeds for over 30 years."}
{"sequence": "From 1953 to 1959 the beagle was ranked No."}
{"sequence": "1 on the list of the American Kennel Club's registered breeds; in 2005 and 2006 it ranked 5th out of the 155 breeds registered."}
{"sequence": "In the UK they are not quite so popular, placing 28th and 30th in the rankings of registrations with the Kennel Club in 2005 and 2006 respectively."}
{"sequence": "In the United States the beagle ranked 4th most popular breed in 2012 and 2013, behind the Labrador Retriever (#1), German Shepherd (#2) and Golden Retriever (#3) breeds."}
{"sequence": "According to the \"Oxford English Dictionary\", the first mention of the beagle by name in English literature dates from c. 1475 in \"The Squire of Low Degree\"."}
{"sequence": "The origin of the word \"beagle\" is uncertain, although it has been suggested that the word derives from the French \"begueule\"."}
{"sequence": "It is not known why the black and tan Kerry Beagle, present in Ireland since Celtic times, has the \"beagle\" description, since at it is significantly taller than the modern day beagle, and in earlier times was even larger."}
{"sequence": "Some writers suggest that the beagle's scenting ability may have come from cross-breeding earlier strains with the Kerry Beagle."}
{"sequence": "Originally used for hunting stags, it is today used for hare and drag hunting."}
{"sequence": "The general appearance of the beagle resembles a miniature Foxhound, but the head is broader and the muzzle shorter, the expression completely different and the legs shorter in proportion to the body."}
{"sequence": "They have a smooth, somewhat domed skull with a medium-length, square-cut muzzle and a black (or occasionally liver) gumdrop nose."}
{"sequence": "The jaw is strong and the teeth scissor together with the upper teeth fitting perfectly over the lower teeth and both sets aligned square to the jaw."}
{"sequence": "The eyes are large, hazel or brown, with a mild hound-like pleading look."}
{"sequence": "The large ears are long, soft and low-set, turning towards the cheeks slightly and rounded at the tips."}
{"sequence": "Beagles have a strong, medium-length neck (which is long enough for them to easily bend to the ground to pick up a scent), with little folding in the skin but some evidence of a dewlap; a broad chest narrowing to a tapered abdomen and waist and a long, slightly curved tail (known as the \"stern\") tipped with white."}
{"sequence": "The white tip, known as the flag, was bred for selectively, as the tail remains easily seen when the dog's head is down following a scent."}
{"sequence": "The tail does not curl over the back, but is held upright when the dog is active."}
{"sequence": "The beagle has a muscular body and a medium-length, smooth, hard coat."}
{"sequence": "The front legs are straight and carried under the body while the rear legs are muscular and well bent at the stifles."}
{"sequence": "The tricolored beaglewhite with large black areas and light brown shadingis the most common."}
{"sequence": "Tricolored beagles occur in a number of shades, from the \"Classic Tri\" with a jet black saddle (also known as \"Blackback\"), to the \"Dark Tri\" (where faint brown markings are intermingled with more prominent black markings), to the \"Faded Tri\" (where faint black markings are intermingled with more prominent brown markings)."}
{"sequence": "Some tricolored dogs have a broken pattern, sometimes referred to as \"pied\"."}
{"sequence": "These dogs have mostly white coats with patches of black and brown hair."}
{"sequence": "Tricolor beagles are almost always born black and white."}
{"sequence": "The white areas are typically set by eight weeks, but the black areas may fade to brown as the puppy matures. ("}
{"sequence": "The brown may take between one and two years to fully develop.)"}
{"sequence": "Some beagles gradually change color during their lives, and may lose their black markings entirely."}
{"sequence": "Two-color varieties always have a white base color with areas of the second color."}
{"sequence": "Tan and white is the most common two-color variety, but there is a wide range of other colors including lemon, a very light tan; red, a reddish, almost orange, brown; and liver, a darker brown, and black."}
{"sequence": "Liver is not common and is not permitted in some standards; it tends to occur with yellow eyes."}
{"sequence": "Ticked or mottled varieties may be either white or black with different colored flecks (\"ticking\"), such as the blue-mottled or bluetick beagle, which has spots that appear to be a midnight-blue color, similar to the coloring of the Bluetick Coonhound."}
{"sequence": "Some tricolor beagles also have ticking of various colors in their white areas."}
{"sequence": "Alongside the Bloodhound and Basset Hound, the beagle has one of the best developed senses of smell of any dog."}
{"sequence": "In the 1950s, John Paul Scott and John Fuller began a 13-year study of canine behavior."}
{"sequence": "As part of this research, they tested the scenting abilities of various breeds by putting a mouse in a one-acre field and timing how long it took the dogs to find it."}
{"sequence": "The beagles found it in less than a minute, while Fox Terriers took 15 minutes and Scottish Terriers failed to find it at all."}
{"sequence": "Beagles are better at ground-scenting (following a trail on the ground) than they are at air-scenting, and for this reason they have been excluded from most mountain rescue teams in favor of collies, which use sight in addition to air-scenting and are more biddable."}
{"sequence": "The long ears and large lips of the beagle probably assist in trapping the scents close to the nose."}
{"sequence": "English and American varieties are sometimes mentioned."}
{"sequence": "However, there is no official recognition from any Kennel Club for this distinction."}
{"sequence": "Pocket Beagles are sometimes advertised for sale but while the UK Kennel Club originally specified a standard for the Pocket Beagle in 1901, the variety is now not recognized by any Kennel Club."}
{"sequence": "A strain known as Patch Hounds was developed by Willet Randall and his family from 1896 specifically for their rabbit hunting ability."}
{"sequence": "They trace their bloodline back to Field Champion Patch, but do not necessarily have a patchwork marking."}
{"sequence": "In the 1850s, Stonehenge recommended a cross between a Beagle and a Scottish Terrier as a retriever."}
{"sequence": "He found the crossbreed to be a good worker, silent and obedient, but it had the drawback that it was small and could barely carry a hare."}
{"sequence": "More recently the trend has been for \"designer dogs\" and one of the most popular has been the Beagle/Pug cross known as a Puggle."}
{"sequence": "Some puppies of this cross are less excitable than a Beagle and with a lower exercise requirement, similar to the Pug parent; but many are highly excitable and require vigorous exercise."}
{"sequence": "The beagle has an even temper and gentle disposition."}
{"sequence": "Described in several breed standards as \"merry\", they are amiable and typically neither aggressive nor timid, although this depends on the individual."}
{"sequence": "They enjoy company, and although they may initially be standoffish with strangers, they are easily won over."}
{"sequence": "They make poor guard dogs for this reason, although their tendency to bark or howl when confronted with the unfamiliar makes them good watch dogs."}
{"sequence": "In a 1985 study conducted by Ben and Lynette Hart, the beagle was given the highest excitability rating, along with the Yorkshire Terrier, Cairn Terrier, Miniature Schnauzer, West Highland White Terrier, and Fox Terrier."}
{"sequence": "Beagles are intelligent but, as a result of being bred for the long chase, are single-minded and determined, which can make them hard to train."}
{"sequence": "They can be difficult to recall once they have picked up a scent, and are easily distracted by smells around them."}
{"sequence": "They do not generally feature in obedience trials; while they are alert, respond well to food-reward training, and are eager to please, they are easily bored or distracted."}
{"sequence": "They are ranked 72nd in Stanley Coren's \"The Intelligence of Dogs\", as Coren places them among the group with the lowest degree of working/obedience intelligence."}
{"sequence": "Coren's scale, however, does not assess understanding, independence, or creativity."}
{"sequence": "Beagles are excellent with children and this is one of the reasons they have become popular family pets."}
{"sequence": "But as beagles are pack animals, they are prone to separation anxiety, a condition which causes them to destroy things when left unattended."}
{"sequence": "Not all beagles will howl, but most will bark when confronted with strange situations, and some will bay (also referred to as \"speaking\", \"giving tongue\", or \"opening\") when they catch the scent of potential quarry."}
{"sequence": "They also generally get along well with cats and other dogs."}
{"sequence": "They are not too demanding with regard to exercise; their inbred stamina means they do not easily tire when exercised, but they also do not need to be worked to exhaustion before they will rest."}
{"sequence": "Regular exercise helps ward off the weight gain to which the breed is prone."}
{"sequence": "The typical longevity of beagles is 12–15 years, which is a common lifespan for dogs of their size."}
{"sequence": "Beagles may be prone to epilepsy, but this can often be controlled with medication."}
{"sequence": "Hypothyroidism and a number of types of dwarfism occur in beagles."}
{"sequence": "Two conditions in particular are unique to the breed: \"Funny Puppy\", in which the puppy is slow to develop and eventually develops weak legs, a crooked back and although normally healthy, is prone to a range of illnesses; and Musladin-Lueke syndrome (MLS) in which the eyes are slanted and the outer toes are underdeveloped but otherwise development is as normal."}
{"sequence": "Hip dysplasia, common in Harriers and in some larger breeds, is rarely considered a problem in beagles."}
{"sequence": "Beagles are considered a chondrodystrophic breed, meaning that they are prone to types of disk diseases."}
{"sequence": "In rare cases, beagles may develop immune mediated polygenic arthritis (where the immune system attacks the joints) even at a young age."}
{"sequence": "The symptoms can sometimes be relieved by steroid treatments."}
{"sequence": "Another rare disease in the breed is neonatal cerebellar cortical degeneration."}
{"sequence": "Affected puppies are slow, have lower co-ordination, fall more often and don't have a normal gait."}
{"sequence": "It has an estimated carrier rate of 5% and affected rate of 0.1%."}
{"sequence": "A genetic test is available."}
{"sequence": "Their long floppy ears can mean that the inner ear does not receive a substantial air flow or that moist air becomes trapped, and this can lead to ear infections."}
{"sequence": "Beagles may also be affected by a range of eye problems; two common ophthalmic conditions in beagles are glaucoma and corneal dystrophy. \""}
{"sequence": "Cherry eye\", a prolapse of the gland of the third eyelid, and distichiasis, a condition in which eyelashes grow into the eye causing irritation, sometimes exist; both these conditions can be corrected with surgery."}
{"sequence": "They can suffer from several types of retinal atrophy."}
{"sequence": "Failure of the nasolacrimal drainage system can cause dry eye or leakage of tears onto the face."}
{"sequence": "As field dogs they are prone to minor injuries such as cuts and sprains, and, if inactive, obesity is a common problem as they will eat whenever food is available and rely on their owners to regulate their weight."}
{"sequence": "When working or running free they are also likely to pick up parasites such as fleas, ticks, harvest mites, and tapeworms, and irritants such as grass seeds can become trapped in their eyes, soft ears, or paws."}
{"sequence": "Beagles may exhibit a behavior known as reverse sneezing, in which they sound as if they are choking or gasping for breath, but are actually drawing air in through the mouth and nose."}
{"sequence": "The exact cause of this behavior is not known, but it can be a common occurrence and is not harmful to the dog."}
{"sequence": "The average size of a beagle litter is six puppies."}
{"sequence": "When mother beagles give birth to litters of puppies, the little pups weigh just a few ounces each."}
{"sequence": "Beagles were developed primarily for hunting hare, an activity known as beagling."}
{"sequence": "They were seen as ideal hunting companions for the elderly who could follow on horseback without exerting themselves, for young hunters who could keep up with them on ponies, and for the poorer hunters who could not afford to maintain a stable of good hunting horses."}
{"sequence": "Before the advent of the fashion for foxhunting in the 19th century, hunting was an all day event where the enjoyment was derived from the chase rather than the kill."}
{"sequence": "In this setting the tiny beagle was well matched to the hare, as unlike Harriers they would not quickly finish the hunt, but because of their excellent scent-tracking skills and stamina they were almost guaranteed to eventually catch the hare."}
{"sequence": "The beagle packs would run closely together (\"so close that they might be covered with a sheet\") which was useful in a long hunt, as it prevented stray dogs from obscuring the trail."}
{"sequence": "In thick undergrowth they were also preferred to spaniels when hunting pheasant."}
{"sequence": "With the fashion for faster hunts, the beagle fell out of favor for chasing hare, but was still employed for rabbit hunting."}
{"sequence": "In \"Anecdotes of Dogs\" (1846), Edward Jesse says: In the United States they appear to have been employed chiefly for hunting rabbits from the earliest imports."}
{"sequence": "Hunting hare with beagles became popular again in Britain in the mid-19th century and continued until it was made illegal in Scotland by the Protection of Wild Mammals (Scotland) Act 2002 and in England and Wales by the Hunting Act 2004."}
{"sequence": "Under this legislation beagles may still pursue rabbits with the landowner's permission."}
{"sequence": "Drag hunting is popular where hunting is no longer permitted or for those owners who do not wish to participate in hunting a live animal, but still wish to exercise their dog's innate skills."}
{"sequence": "The traditional foot pack consists of up to 40 beagles, marshaled by a Huntsman who directs the pack and who is assisted by a variable number of whippers-in whose job is to return straying hounds to the pack."}
{"sequence": "The Master of the Hunt is in overall day-to-day charge of the pack, and may or may not take on the role of Huntsman on the day of the hunt."}
{"sequence": "As hunting with beagles was seen as ideal for young people, many of the British public schools traditionally maintained beagle packs."}
{"sequence": "Protests were lodged against Eton's use of beagles for hunting as early as 1902 but the pack is still in existence today, and a pack used by Imperial College in Wye, Kent was stolen by the Animal Liberation Front in 2001."}
{"sequence": "School and university packs are still maintained by Eton, Marlborough, Wye, Radley, the Royal Agricultural University and Christ Church, Oxford."}
{"sequence": "In addition to organized beagling, beagles have been used for hunting or flushing to guns (often in pairs) a wide range of game including snowshoe hare, cottontail rabbits, game birds, roe deer, red deer, bobcat, coyote, wild boar and foxes, and have even been recorded as being used to hunt stoat."}
{"sequence": "In most of these cases, the beagle is employed as a gun dog, flushing game for hunter's guns."}
{"sequence": "Beagles are used as detection dogs in the Beagle Brigade of the United States Department of Agriculture."}
{"sequence": "These dogs are used to detect food items in luggage being taken into the United States."}
{"sequence": "After trialling several breeds, beagles were chosen because they are relatively small and unintimidating for people who are uncomfortable around dogs, easy to care for, intelligent and work well for rewards."}
{"sequence": "They are also used for this purpose in a number of other countries including by the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in New Zealand, the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service, and in Canada, Japan and the People's Republic of China."}
{"sequence": "Larger breeds are generally used for detection of explosives as this often involves climbing over luggage and on large conveyor belts, work for which the smaller Beagle is not suited."}
{"sequence": "Beagles are the dog breed most often used in animal testing, due to their size and passive nature."}
{"sequence": "In the United States, as many as 65,000 beagles are used every year for medical, cosmetic, beauty, and other chemical tests."}
{"sequence": "They are purpose bred and live their lives in cages undergoing experiments."}
{"sequence": "The Rescue + Freedom Project (formerly Beagle Freedom Project) has successfully advocated for beagles to be released from labs."}
{"sequence": "This organization has freed hundreds of animals."}
{"sequence": "Beagles are used in a range of research procedures: fundamental biological research, applied human medicine, applied veterinary medicine, and protection of man, animals or the environment."}
{"sequence": "Of the 8,018 dogs used in testing in the UK in 2004, 7,799 were beagles (97.3%)."}
{"sequence": "In the UK, the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 gave special status to primates, equids, cats and dogs and in 2005 the Animal Procedures Committee (set up by the act) ruled that testing on mice was preferable, even though a greater number of individual animals were involved."}
{"sequence": "In 2005 beagles were involved in less than 0.3% of the total experiments on animals in the UK, but of the 7670 experiments performed on dogs 7406 involved beagles (96.6%)."}
{"sequence": "Most dogs are bred specifically for this purpose, by companies such as Harlan."}
{"sequence": "In the UK companies breeding animals for research must be licensed under the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act."}
{"sequence": "Testing of cosmetic products on animals is banned in the member states of the European Community, although France protested the ban and has made efforts to have it lifted."}
{"sequence": "It is permitted in the United States but is not mandatory if safety can be ascertained by other methods, and the test species is not specified by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)."}
{"sequence": "When testing toxicity of food additives, food contaminants, and some drugs and chemicals the FDA uses beagles and miniature pigs as surrogates for direct human testing."}
{"sequence": "Minnesota was the first state to enact a Beagle Freedom adoption law in 2014, mandating that dogs and cats are allowed to be adopted once they have completed research testing."}

{"sequence": "Although bred for hunting, Beagles are versatile and are nowadays employed for various other roles in detection, therapy, and as family pets."}
{"sequence": "Beagles are used as sniffer dogs for termite detection in Australia, and have been mentioned as possible candidates for drug and explosive detection."}
{"sequence": "Because of their gentle nature and unimposing build, they are also frequently used in pet therapy, visiting the sick and elderly in hospital."}

{"sequence": "It was used for some armour, being both much cheaper and much lighter than plate armour, but could not withstand a direct blow from a blade, nor a gunshot."}
{"sequence": "Alternative names are \"moulded leather\" and \"hardened leather\"."}
{"sequence": "In the course of making the material it becomes very soft, and can be impressed into a mould to give it the desired shape and decoration, which most surviving examples have."}

{"sequence": "Various recipes for making cuir bouilli survive, and do not agree with each other; probably there were a range of recipes, partly reflecting different final uses."}
{"sequence": "Vegetable-tanned leather is generally specified."}
{"sequence": "Scholars have debated the subject at length and attempted to recreate the historical material."}
{"sequence": "Many, but not all, sources agree that actual boiling of the leather was not part of the process, but immersion in water, cold or hot, was."}
{"sequence": "Cuir bouilli was used for cheap and light armour, although it was much less effective than plate armour, which was extremely expensive and too heavy for much to be worn by infantry (as opposed to knights fighting on foot)."}
{"sequence": "However, cuir bouilli could be reinforced against slashing blows by the addition of metal bands or strips, especially in helmets."}
{"sequence": "Modern experiments on simple cuir bouilli have shown that it can reduce the depth of an arrow wound considerably, especially if coated with a crushed mineral facing mixed with glue, as one medieval Arab author recommended."}

{"sequence": "Versions of cuir bouilli were used since ancient times, especially for shields, in many parts of the world."}
{"sequence": "Although in general leather does not survive long burial, and excavated archaeological evidence for it is rare, an Irish shield of cuir bouilli with wooden formers, deposited in a peat bog, has survived for some 2,500 years."}
{"sequence": "It was commonly used in the Western world for helmets; the pickelhaube, the standard German helmet, was not replaced by a steel stahlhelm until 1916, in the midst of World War I. As leather does not conduct heat the way metal does, firemen continued to use boiled leather helmets until WW2, and the invention of strong plastics."}
{"sequence": "The word cuirass for a breastplate indicates that these were originally made of leather."}
{"sequence": "In the Late Middle Ages, the heyday of plate armour, cuir bouilli continued to be used even by the rich for horse armour and often for tournament armour, as well as by ordinary infantry soldiers."}

{"sequence": "In 1540 the original silver was melted down for church plate to replace that looted in the Sack of Rome in 1527."}
{"sequence": "It seems likely that the leather was moulded directly from the original and it is possible that the wooden core underneath is actually the Carolingian original, with the leather replacing the sheets of silver originally fitted over the wood."}
{"sequence": "Cuir bouilli has also been employed to bind books, mainly between the 9th and 14th centuries."}
{"sequence": "Other uses include high boots for especially tough use, which were called \"postillion's boots\" in England."}
{"sequence": "Another use was for large bottles or jugs called \"blackjacks\", \"bombards\" or \"costerns\"."}
{"sequence": "There is an English reference to these from 1373."}
{"sequence": "Buffer overflow In information security and programming, a buffer overflow, or buffer overrun, is an anomaly where a program, while writing data to a buffer, overruns the buffer's boundary and overwrites adjacent memory locations."}
{"sequence": "Buffers are areas of memory set aside to hold data, often while moving it from one section of a program to another, or between programs."}
{"sequence": "Buffer overflows can often be triggered by malformed inputs; if one assumes all inputs will be smaller than a certain size and the buffer is created to be that size, then an anomalous transaction that produces more data could cause it to write past the end of the buffer."}
{"sequence": "If this overwrites adjacent data or executable code, this may result in erratic program behavior, including memory access errors, incorrect results, and crashes."}
{"sequence": "Exploiting the behavior of a buffer overflow is a well-known security exploit."}
{"sequence": "On many systems, the memory layout of a program, or the system as a whole, is well defined."}
{"sequence": "By sending in data designed to cause a buffer overflow, it is possible to write into areas known to hold executable code and replace it with malicious code, or to selectively overwrite data pertaining to the program's state, therefore causing behavior that was not intended by the original programmer."}
{"sequence": "Buffers are widespread in operating system (OS) code, so it is possible to make attacks that perform privilege escalation and gain unlimited access to the computer's resources."}
{"sequence": "The famed Morris worm in 1988 used this as one of its attack techniques."}
{"sequence": "Programming languages commonly associated with buffer overflows include C and C++, which provide no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory and do not automatically check that data written to an array (the built-in buffer type) is within the boundaries of that array."}
{"sequence": "Bounds checking can prevent buffer overflows, but requires additional code and processing time."}
{"sequence": "Modern operating systems use a variety of techniques to combat malicious buffer overflows, notably by randomizing the layout of memory, or deliberately leaving space between buffers and looking for actions that write into those areas (\"canaries\")."}
{"sequence": "A buffer overflow occurs when data written to a buffer also corrupts data values in memory addresses adjacent to the destination buffer due to insufficient bounds checking."}
{"sequence": "This can occur when copying data from one buffer to another without first checking that the data fits within the destination buffer."}
{"sequence": "Now, the program attempts to store the null-terminated string with ASCII encoding in the A buffer."}
{"sequence": "strcpy(A, \"excessive\"); B's value has now been inadvertently replaced by a number formed from part of the character string."}
{"sequence": "In this example \"e\" followed by a zero byte would become 25856."}
{"sequence": "Writing data past the end of allocated memory can sometimes be detected by the operating system to generate a segmentation fault error that terminates the process."}
{"sequence": "To prevent the buffer overflow from happening in this example, the call to strcpy could be replaced with strlcpy, which takes the maximum capacity of A (including a null-termination character) as an additional parameter and ensures that no more than this amount of data is written to A: strlcpy(A, \"excessive\", sizeof(A)); When available, the strlcpy library function is preferred over strncpy which does not null-terminate the destination buffer if the source string's length is greater than or equal to the size of the buffer (the third argument passed to the function), therefore A may not be null-terminated and cannot be treated as a valid C-style string."}
{"sequence": "The techniques to exploit a buffer overflow vulnerability vary by architecture, by operating system and by memory region."}
{"sequence": "For example, exploitation on the heap (used for dynamically allocated memory), differs markedly from exploitation on the call stack."}
{"sequence": "A technically inclined user may exploit stack-based buffer overflows to manipulate the program to their advantage in one of several ways: The attacker designs data to cause one of these exploits, then places this data in a buffer supplied to users by the vulnerable code."}
{"sequence": "If the address of the user-supplied data used to affect the stack buffer overflow is unpredictable, exploiting a stack buffer overflow to cause remote code execution becomes much more difficult."}
{"sequence": "One technique that can be used to exploit such a buffer overflow is called \"trampolining\"."}
{"sequence": "In that technique, an attacker will find a pointer to the vulnerable stack buffer, and compute the location of their shellcode relative to that pointer."}
{"sequence": "Then, they will use the overwrite to jump to an instruction already in memory which will make a second jump, this time relative to the pointer; that second jump will branch execution into the shellcode."}
{"sequence": "Suitable instructions are often present in large code."}
{"sequence": "The Metasploit Project, for example, maintains a database of suitable opcodes, though it lists only those found in the Windows operating system."}
{"sequence": "A buffer overflow occurring in the heap data area is referred to as a heap overflow and is exploitable in a manner different from that of stack-based overflows."}
{"sequence": "Memory on the heap is dynamically allocated by the application at run-time and typically contains program data."}
{"sequence": "Exploitation is performed by corrupting this data in specific ways to cause the application to overwrite internal structures such as linked list pointers."}
{"sequence": "The canonical heap overflow technique overwrites dynamic memory allocation linkage (such as malloc meta data) and uses the resulting pointer exchange to overwrite a program function pointer."}
{"sequence": "Microsoft's GDI+ vulnerability in handling JPEGs is an example of the danger a heap overflow can present."}
{"sequence": "Manipulation of the buffer, which occurs before it is read or executed, may lead to the failure of an exploitation attempt."}
{"sequence": "These manipulations can mitigate the threat of exploitation, but may not make it impossible."}
{"sequence": "Manipulations could include conversion to upper or lower case, removal of metacharacters and filtering out of non-alphanumeric strings."}
{"sequence": "However, techniques exist to bypass these filters and manipulations; alphanumeric code, polymorphic code, self-modifying code and return-to-libc attacks."}
{"sequence": "The same methods can be used to avoid detection by intrusion detection systems."}
{"sequence": "In some cases, including where code is converted into Unicode, the threat of the vulnerability has been misrepresented by the disclosers as only Denial of Service when in fact the remote execution of arbitrary code is possible."}
{"sequence": "In real-world exploits there are a variety of challenges which need to be overcome for exploits to operate reliably."}
{"sequence": "These factors include null bytes in addresses, variability in the location of shellcode, differences between environments and various counter-measures in operation."}
{"sequence": "A NOP-sled is the oldest and most widely known technique for exploiting stack buffer overflows."}
{"sequence": "It solves the problem of finding the exact address of the buffer by effectively increasing the size of the target area."}
{"sequence": "To do this, much larger sections of the stack are corrupted with the no-op machine instruction."}
{"sequence": "At the end of the attacker-supplied data, after the no-op instructions, the attacker places an instruction to perform a relative jump to the top of the buffer where the shellcode is located."}
{"sequence": "This collection of no-ops is referred to as the \"NOP-sled\" because if the return address is overwritten with any address within the no-op region of the buffer, the execution will \"slide\" down the no-ops until it is redirected to the actual malicious code by the jump at the end."}
{"sequence": "This technique requires the attacker to guess where on the stack the NOP-sled is instead of the comparatively small shellcode."}
{"sequence": "Because of the popularity of this technique, many vendors of intrusion prevention systems will search for this pattern of no-op machine instructions in an attempt to detect shellcode in use."}
{"sequence": "It is important to note that a NOP-sled does not necessarily contain only traditional no-op machine instructions; any instruction that does not corrupt the machine state to a point where the shellcode will not run can be used in place of the hardware assisted no-op."}
{"sequence": "As a result, it has become common practice for exploit writers to compose the no-op sled with randomly chosen instructions which will have no real effect on the shellcode execution."}
{"sequence": "While this method greatly improves the chances that an attack will be successful, it is not without problems."}
{"sequence": "Exploits using this technique still must rely on some amount of luck that they will guess offsets on the stack that are within the NOP-sled region."}
{"sequence": "An incorrect guess will usually result in the target program crashing and could alert the system administrator to the attacker's activities."}
{"sequence": "Another problem is that the NOP-sled requires a much larger amount of memory in which to hold a NOP-sled large enough to be of any use."}
{"sequence": "This can be a problem when the allocated size of the affected buffer is too small and the current depth of the stack is shallow (i.e., there is not much space from the end of the current stack frame to the start of the stack)."}
{"sequence": "Despite its problems, the NOP-sled is often the only method that will work for a given platform, environment, or situation, and as such it is still an important technique."}
{"sequence": "The \"jump to register\" technique allows for reliable exploitation of stack buffer overflows without the need for extra room for a NOP-sled and without having to guess stack offsets."}
{"sequence": "The strategy is to overwrite the return pointer with something that will cause the program to jump to a known pointer stored within a register which points to the controlled buffer and thus the shellcode."}
{"sequence": "For example, if register A contains a pointer to the start of a buffer then any jump or call taking that register as an operand can be used to gain control of the flow of execution."}
{"sequence": "In practice a program may not intentionally contain instructions to jump to a particular register."}
{"sequence": "The traditional solution is to find an unintentional instance of a suitable opcode at a fixed location somewhere within the program memory."}
{"sequence": "In figure on the left is an example of such an unintentional instance of the i386 codice_1 instruction."}
{"sequence": "The opcode for this instruction is codice_2."}
{"sequence": "This two-byte sequence can be found at a one-byte offset from the start of the instruction codice_3 at address codice_4."}
{"sequence": "If an attacker overwrites the program return address with this address the program will first jump to codice_4, interpret the opcode codice_2 as the codice_1 instruction, and will then jump to the top of the stack and execute the attacker's code."}
{"sequence": "When this technique is possible the severity of the vulnerability increases considerably."}
{"sequence": "This is because exploitation will work reliably enough to automate an attack with a virtual guarantee of success when it is run."}
{"sequence": "For this reason, this is the technique most commonly used in Internet worms that exploit stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities."}
{"sequence": "This method also allows shellcode to be placed after the overwritten return address on the Windows platform."}
{"sequence": "Since executables are mostly based at address codice_8 and x86 is a Little Endian architecture, the last byte of the return address must be a null, which terminates the buffer copy and nothing is written beyond that."}
{"sequence": "This limits the size of the shellcode to the size of the buffer, which may be overly restrictive."}
{"sequence": "DLLs are located in high memory (above codice_9) and so have addresses containing no null bytes, so this method can remove null bytes (or other disallowed characters) from the overwritten return address."}
{"sequence": "Used in this way, the method is often referred to as \"DLL trampolining\"."}
{"sequence": "Various techniques have been used to detect or prevent buffer overflows, with various tradeoffs."}
{"sequence": "The most reliable way to avoid or prevent buffer overflows is to use automatic protection at the language level."}
{"sequence": "This sort of protection, however, cannot be applied to legacy code, and often technical, business, or cultural constraints call for a vulnerable language."}
{"sequence": "The following sections describe the choices and implementations available."}
{"sequence": "Assembly and C/C++ are popular programming languages that are vulnerable to buffer overflow, in part because they allow direct access to memory and are not strongly typed."}
{"sequence": "C provides no built-in protection against accessing or overwriting data in any part of memory; more specifically, it does not check that data written to a buffer is within the boundaries of that buffer."}
{"sequence": "The standard C++ libraries provide many ways of safely buffering data, and C++'s Standard Template Library (STL) provides containers that can optionally perform bounds checking if the programmer explicitly calls for checks while accessing data."}
{"sequence": "For example, a codice_10's member function codice_11 performs a bounds check and throws an codice_12 exception if the bounds check fails."}
{"sequence": "However, C++ behaves just like C if the bounds check is not explicitly called."}
{"sequence": "Techniques to avoid buffer overflows also exist for C. Languages that are strongly typed and do not allow direct memory access, such as COBOL, Java, Python, and others, prevent buffer overflow from occurring in most cases."}
{"sequence": "Many programming languages other than C/C++ provide runtime checking and in some cases even compile-time checking which might send a warning or raise an exception when C or C++ would overwrite data and continue to execute further instructions until erroneous results are obtained which might or might not cause the program to crash."}
{"sequence": "Examples of such languages include Ada, Eiffel, Lisp, Modula-2, Smalltalk, OCaml and such C-derivatives as Cyclone, Rust and D. The Java and .NET Framework bytecode environments also require bounds checking on all arrays."}
{"sequence": "Nearly every interpreted language will protect against buffer overflows, signaling a well-defined error condition."}
{"sequence": "Often where a language provides enough type information to do bounds checking an option is provided to enable or disable it."}
{"sequence": "Static code analysis can remove many dynamic bound and type checks, but poor implementations and awkward cases can significantly decrease performance."}
{"sequence": "Software engineers must carefully consider the tradeoffs of safety versus performance costs when deciding which language and compiler setting to use."}
{"sequence": "The problem of buffer overflows is common in the C and C++ languages because they expose low level representational details of buffers as containers for data types."}
{"sequence": "Buffer overflows must thus be avoided by maintaining a high degree of correctness in code which performs buffer management."}
{"sequence": "It has also long been recommended to avoid standard library functions which are not bounds checked, such as codice_13, codice_14 and codice_15."}
{"sequence": "The Morris worm exploited a codice_13 call in fingerd."}
{"sequence": "Well-written and tested abstract data type libraries which centralize and automatically perform buffer management, including bounds checking, can reduce the occurrence and impact of buffer overflows."}
{"sequence": "The two main building-block data types in these languages in which buffer overflows commonly occur are strings and arrays; thus, libraries preventing buffer overflows in these data types can provide the vast majority of the necessary coverage."}
{"sequence": "Still, failure to use these safe libraries correctly can result in buffer overflows and other vulnerabilities; and naturally, any bug in the library itself is a potential vulnerability. \""}
{"sequence": "Safe\" library implementations include \"The Better String Library\", Vstr and Erwin."}
{"sequence": "The OpenBSD operating system's C library provides the strlcpy and strlcat functions, but these are more limited than full safe library implementations."}
{"sequence": "In September 2007, Technical Report 24731, prepared by the C standards committee, was published; it specifies a set of functions which are based on the standard C library's string and I/O functions, with additional buffer-size parameters."}
{"sequence": "However, the efficacy of these functions for the purpose of reducing buffer overflows is disputable; it requires programmer intervention on a per function call basis that is equivalent to intervention that could make the analogous older standard library functions buffer overflow safe."}
{"sequence": "Buffer overflow protection is used to detect the most common buffer overflows by checking that the stack has not been altered when a function returns."}
{"sequence": "If it has been altered, the program exits with a segmentation fault."}
{"sequence": "Three such systems are Libsafe, and the \"StackGuard\" and \"ProPolice\" gcc patches."}
{"sequence": "Microsoft's implementation of Data Execution Prevention (DEP) mode explicitly protects the pointer to the Structured Exception Handler (SEH) from being overwritten."}
{"sequence": "Stronger stack protection is possible by splitting the stack in two: one for data and one for function returns."}
{"sequence": "This split is present in the Forth language, though it was not a security-based design decision."}
{"sequence": "Regardless, this is not a complete solution to buffer overflows, as sensitive data other than the return address may still be overwritten."}
{"sequence": "Buffer overflows work by manipulating pointers, including stored addresses."}
{"sequence": "PointGuard was proposed as a compiler-extension to prevent attackers from being able to reliably manipulate pointers and addresses."}
{"sequence": "The approach works by having the compiler add code to automatically XOR-encode pointers before and after they are used."}
{"sequence": "Theoretically, because the attacker does not know what value will be used to encode/decode the pointer, he cannot predict what it will point to if he overwrites it with a new value."}
{"sequence": "PointGuard was never released, but Microsoft implemented a similar approach beginning in Windows XP SP2 and Windows Server 2003 SP1."}
{"sequence": "Rather than implement pointer protection as an automatic feature, Microsoft added an API routine that can be called."}
{"sequence": "This allows for better performance (because it is not used all of the time), but places the burden on the programmer to know when it is necessary."}
{"sequence": "Because XOR is linear, an attacker may be able to manipulate an encoded pointer by overwriting only the lower bytes of an address."}
{"sequence": "This can allow an attack to succeed if the attacker is able to attempt the exploit multiple times or is able to complete an attack by causing a pointer to point to one of several locations (such as any location within a NOP sled)."}
{"sequence": "Microsoft added a random rotation to their encoding scheme to address this weakness to partial overwrites."}
{"sequence": "Executable space protection is an approach to buffer overflow protection which prevents execution of code on the stack or the heap."}
{"sequence": "An attacker may use buffer overflows to insert arbitrary code into the memory of a program, but with executable space protection, any attempt to execute that code will cause an exception."}
{"sequence": "Some CPUs support a feature called NX (\"No eXecute\") or XD (\"eXecute Disabled\") bit, which in conjunction with software, can be used to mark pages of data (such as those containing the stack and the heap) as readable and writable but not executable."}
{"sequence": "Some Unix operating systems (e.g. OpenBSD, macOS) ship with executable space protection (e.g. W^X)."}
{"sequence": "Some optional packages include: Newer variants of Microsoft Windows also support executable space protection, called Data Execution Prevention."}
{"sequence": "Proprietary add-ons include: Executable space protection does not generally protect against return-to-libc attacks, or any other attack which does not rely on the execution of the attackers code."}
{"sequence": "However, on 64-bit systems using ASLR, as described below, executable space protection makes it far more difficult to execute such attacks."}
{"sequence": "Address space layout randomization (ASLR) is a computer security feature which involves arranging the positions of key data areas, usually including the base of the executable and position of libraries, heap, and stack, randomly in a process' address space."}
{"sequence": "Randomization of the virtual memory addresses at which functions and variables can be found can make exploitation of a buffer overflow more difficult, but not impossible."}
{"sequence": "It also forces the attacker to tailor the exploitation attempt to the individual system, which foils the attempts of internet worms."}
{"sequence": "A similar but less effective method is to rebase processes and libraries in the virtual address space."}
{"sequence": "The use of deep packet inspection (DPI) can detect, at the network perimeter, very basic remote attempts to exploit buffer overflows by use of attack signatures and heuristics."}
{"sequence": "These are able to block packets which have the signature of a known attack, or if a long series of No-Operation instructions (known as a NOP-sled) is detected, these were once used when the location of the exploit's payload is slightly variable."}
{"sequence": "Packet scanning is not an effective method since it can only prevent known attacks and there are many ways that a NOP-sled can be encoded."}
{"sequence": "Shellcode used by attackers can be made alphanumeric, metamorphic, or self-modifying to evade detection by heuristic packet scanners and intrusion detection systems."}
{"sequence": "Checking for buffer overflows and patching the bugs that cause them naturally helps prevent buffer overflows."}
{"sequence": "One common automated technique for discovering them is fuzzing."}
{"sequence": "Edge case testing can also uncover buffer overflows, as can static analysis."}
{"sequence": "Once a potential buffer overflow is detected, it must be patched; this makes the testing approach useful for software that is in development, but less useful for legacy software that is no longer maintained or supported."}
{"sequence": "Buffer overflows were understood and partially publicly documented as early as 1972, when the Computer Security Technology Planning Study laid out the technique: \"The code performing this function does not check the source and destination addresses properly, permitting portions of the monitor to be overlaid by the user."}
{"sequence": "This can be used to inject code into the monitor that will permit the user to seize control of the machine.\""}
{"sequence": "Today, the monitor would be referred to as the kernel."}
{"sequence": "The earliest documented hostile exploitation of a buffer overflow was in 1988."}
{"sequence": "It was one of several exploits used by the Morris worm to propagate itself over the Internet."}
{"sequence": "The program exploited was a service on Unix called finger."}
{"sequence": "Later, in 1995, Thomas Lopatic independently rediscovered the buffer overflow and published his findings on the Bugtraq security mailing list."}
{"sequence": "A year later, in 1996, Elias Levy (also known as Aleph One) published in \"Phrack\" magazine the paper \"Smashing the Stack for Fun and Profit\", a step-by-step introduction to exploiting stack-based buffer overflow vulnerabilities."}
{"sequence": "Since then, at least two major internet worms have exploited buffer overflows to compromise a large number of systems."}
{"sequence": "In 2001, the Code Red worm exploited a buffer overflow in Microsoft's Internet Information Services (IIS) 5.0 and in 2003 the SQL Slammer worm compromised machines running Microsoft SQL Server 2000."}
{"sequence": "In 2003, buffer overflows present in licensed Xbox games have been exploited to allow unlicensed software, including homebrew games, to run on the console without the need for hardware modifications, known as modchips."}
{"sequence": "The PS2 Independence Exploit also used a buffer overflow to achieve the same for the PlayStation 2."}

{"sequence": "He attributed it to a response to the pressure he felt to perform as a young player with the Pirates."}
{"sequence": "Remarked Bonds, Bonds reports that for a short time during his playing days with the Giants he changed his demeanor at the behest of a group of teammates, resulting in him smiling much more frequently and engaging more with others with a pleasant attitude."}
{"sequence": "Shortly thereafter, Bonds says, in the midst of a slump, the same group of teammates pleaded that he revert, having seemingly lost his competitive edge, and causing the team to lose more."}
{"sequence": "In spite of his protest that they would not appreciate the results, his teammates insisted."}
{"sequence": "Bonds says he complied, maintaining that familiar standoffish edge the rest of his playing career."}
{"sequence": "Since 2003, Bonds has been a key figure in the Bay Area Laboratory Co-operative (BALCO) scandal."}
{"sequence": "BALCO marketed tetrahydrogestrinone (\"the Clear\"), a performance-enhancing anabolic steroid that was undetectable by doping tests."}
{"sequence": "He was under investigation by a federal grand jury regarding his testimony in the BALCO case, and was indicted on perjury and obstruction of justice charges on November 15, 2007."}
{"sequence": "The indictment alleges that Bonds lied while under oath about his alleged use of steroids."}
{"sequence": "In 2003, Bonds first became embroiled in a scandal when Greg Anderson of BALCO, Bonds' trainer since 2000, was indicted by a federal grand jury in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California and charged with supplying anabolic steroids to athletes, including a number of baseball players."}
{"sequence": "This led to speculation that Bonds had used performance-enhancing drugs during a time when there was no mandatory testing in Major League Baseball."}
{"sequence": "Bonds declared his innocence, attributing his changed physique and increased power to a strict regimen of bodybuilding, diet, and legitimate supplements."}
{"sequence": "During grand jury testimony on December 4, 2003, Bonds said that he used a clear substance and a cream that he received from his personal strength trainer, Greg Anderson, who told him they were the nutritional supplement flaxseed oil and a rubbing balm for arthritis."}
{"sequence": "This testimony, as reported by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, has frequently been misrepresented."}
{"sequence": "Later reports on Bonds' leaked grand-jury testimony contend that he admitted to unknowingly using \"the cream\" and \"the clear\"."}
{"sequence": "In July 2005, all four defendants in the BALCO steroid scandal trial, including Anderson, struck deals with federal prosecutors that did not require them to reveal names of athletes who may have used banned drugs."}
{"sequence": "On November 15, 2007, a federal grand jury indicted Bonds on four counts of perjury and one count of obstruction of justice as it relates to the government investigation of BALCO."}
{"sequence": "He was tried in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California."}
{"sequence": "On February 14, 2008, a typo in court papers filed by Federal prosecutors erroneously alleged that Bonds tested positive for steroids in November 2001, a month after hitting his record 73rd home run."}
{"sequence": "The reference was meant instead to refer to a November 2000 test that had already been disclosed and previously reported."}
{"sequence": "The typo sparked a brief media frenzy."}
{"sequence": "His trial for obstruction of justice was to have begun on March 2, 2009, but jury selection was postponed by emergency appeals by the prosecution."}
{"sequence": "The trial commenced on March 21, 2011, with Judge Susan Illston presiding."}
{"sequence": "He was convicted on April 13, 2011, on the obstruction of justice charge, for giving an evasive answer to a question under oath."}
{"sequence": "On December 15, 2011, Bonds was found guilty for an obstruction of justice conviction stemming from a grand jury appearance in 2003."}
{"sequence": "However, U.S. District Judge Susan Illston then delayed the sentence pending his appeal."}
{"sequence": "He was sentenced to 30 days of house arrest."}
{"sequence": "He also received two years of probation and was ordered to undergo 250 hours of community service."}
{"sequence": "Bonds appealed his conviction to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit."}
{"sequence": "In 2013 a three-judge panel of the Ninth Circuit affirmed his conviction, but in 2015 his appeal was reheard by the full court \"en banc\", which voted 10–1 to overturn his conviction."}
{"sequence": "Bonds withdrew from the MLB Players Association's (MLBPA) licensing agreement because he felt independent marketing deals would be more lucrative for him."}
{"sequence": "Bonds is the first player in the thirty-year history of the licensing program not to sign."}
{"sequence": "Because of this withdrawal, his name and likeness are not usable in any merchandise licensed by the MLBPA."}
{"sequence": "In order to use his name or likeness, a company must deal directly with Bonds."}
{"sequence": "For this reason he does not appear in some baseball video games, forcing game-makers to create generic athletes to replace him."}
{"sequence": "For example, Bonds is replaced by \"Jon Dowd\" in \"MVP Baseball 2005.\""}
{"sequence": "In March 2006 the book \"Game of Shadows\", written by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, was released amid a storm of media publicity including the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\"."}
{"sequence": "Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of \"Sports Illustrated\"."}
{"sequence": "The book alleges Bonds used stanozolol and a host of other steroids, and is perhaps most responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds' steroid use."}
{"sequence": "The book contained excerpts of grand jury testimony that is supposed to be sealed and confidential by law."}
{"sequence": "The authors have been steadfast in their refusal to divulge their sources and at one point faced jail time."}
{"sequence": "On February 14, 2007, Troy Ellerman, one of Victor Conte's lawyers, pleaded guilty to leaking grand jury testimony."}
{"sequence": "Through the plea agreement, he will spend two and a half years in jail."}
{"sequence": "In May 2006, former \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Jeff Pearlman released a revealing biography of Bonds entitled \"Love Me, Hate Me: Barry Bonds and the Making of an Anti-Hero.\""}
{"sequence": "The book also contained many allegations against Bonds."}
{"sequence": "The book, which describes Bonds as a polarizing insufferable braggart with a legendary ego and staggering ability, relied on over five hundred interviews, except with Bonds himself."}
{"sequence": "In April 2006 and May 2006, ESPN aired a few episodes of a 10-part reality TV (unscripted, documentary-style) series starring Bonds."}
{"sequence": "The show, titled \"Bonds on Bonds\", focused on Bonds' chase of Babe Ruth's and Hank Aaron's home run records."}
{"sequence": "Some felt the show should be put on hiatus until baseball investigated Bonds' steroid use allegations."}
{"sequence": "The series was canceled in June 2006, ESPN and producer Tollin/Robbins Productions citing \"creative control\" issues with Bonds and his representatives."}
{"sequence": "Bonds met Susann (\"Sun\") Margreth Branco, the mother of his first two children (Nikolai and Shikari), in Montreal, Quebec in August 1987."}
{"sequence": "They eloped to Las Vegas February 5, 1988."}
{"sequence": "The couple separated in June 1994, divorced in December 1994, and had their marriage annulled in 1997 by the Catholic Church."}
{"sequence": "The divorce was a media affair because Bonds had his Swedish spouse sign a prenuptial agreement in which she \"waived her right to a share of his present and future earnings\" and which was upheld."}
{"sequence": "Bonds had been providing his wife $20,000/month in child support and $10,000 in spousal support at the time of the ruling."}
{"sequence": "During the hearings to set permanent support levels, allegations of abuse came from both parties."}
{"sequence": "The trial dragged on for months, but Bonds was awarded both houses and reduced support."}
{"sequence": "On August 21, 2000, the Supreme Court of California, in an opinion signed by Chief Justice Ronald M. George, unanimously held that \"substantial evidence supports the determination of the trial court that the [prenuptial] agreement in the present case was entered into voluntarily.\""}
{"sequence": "In reaction to the decision, significant changes in California law relating to the validity and enforceability of premarital agreements soon followed."}
{"sequence": "In 2010, Bonds' son Nikolai, who served as a Giants batboy during his father's years playing in San Francisco and always sat next to his dad in the dugout during games, was charged with five misdemeanors resulting from a confrontation with his mother, Sun."}
{"sequence": "Barry accompanied him to San Mateo County Superior Court."}
{"sequence": "After the end of his first marriage, Bonds had an extensive intimate relationship with Kimberly Bell from 1994 through May 2003."}
{"sequence": "Bonds purchased a home in Scottsdale, Arizona for Kimberly."}
{"sequence": "On January 10, 1998, Bonds married his second wife, Liz Watson, at the San Francisco Ritz-Carlton Hotel in front of 240 guests."}
{"sequence": "The couple lived in Los Altos Hills, California, with their daughter Aisha during their ten-and-a-half years of marriage before Watson filed for legal separation on June 9, 2009, citing irreconcilable differences."}
{"sequence": "On July 21, 2009, just six weeks later, Watson announced that she was withdrawing her Legal Separation action."}
{"sequence": "The couple were reconciled for seven months before Watson formally filed for divorce in Los Angeles on February 26, 2010."}
{"sequence": "On June 6, 2011, Bonds and Watson filed a legal agreement not to take the divorce to trial and instead settle it in an \"uncontested manner\", effectively agreeing to take the proceedings out of the public eye and end the marriage privately at an unspecified later date without further court involvement."}
{"sequence": "Several of Bonds' family and extended family members have been involved in athletics as either a career or a notable pastime."}
{"sequence": "Bonds has a younger brother, Bobby, Jr., who was also a professional baseball player."}
{"sequence": "His paternal aunt, Rosie Bonds, is a former American record holder in the 80 meter hurdles, and competed in the 1964 Olympics."}
{"sequence": "In addition, he is a distant cousin of Hall of Famer Reggie Jackson."}
{"sequence": "Among Bonds' many real estate properties is a home he owns in the exclusive gated community of Beverly Park in Beverly Hills, California."}
{"sequence": "An avid cyclist, Bonds chose the activity to be a primary means of keeping in shape and great passion since his playing career."}
{"sequence": "Because knee surgeries, back surgeries, and hip surgeries made it much more difficult to run, cycling has allowed him to engage in sufficient cardiovascular activity to help keep in shape."}
{"sequence": "As a result of the cycling, he has lost 25 pounds from his final playing weight of 240 pounds."}
{"sequence": "Besides holding Major League career records in home runs (762), walks (2,558), and intentional walks (688), at the time of his retirement, Bonds also led all active players in RBI (1,996), on-base percentage (.444), runs (2,227), games (2,986), extra-base hits (1,440), at-bats per home run (12.92), and total bases (5,976)."}
{"sequence": "He is 2nd in doubles (601), slugging percentage (.607), stolen bases (514), at-bats (9,847), and hits (2,935), 6th in triples (77), 8th in sacrifice flies (91), and 9th in strikeouts (1,539), through September 26, 2007."}
{"sequence": "Bonds is the lone member of the 500–500 club, which means he has hit at least 500 home runs (762) and stolen at least 500 bases (514); no other player has even 400 of both."}
{"sequence": "He is also one of only four baseball players all-time to be in the 40–40 club (1996), which means he hit 40 home runs (42) and stole 40 bases (40) in the same season; the other members are José Canseco, Alex Rodriguez, and Alfonso Soriano."}
{"sequence": "The book has a long and complex history; its final form is possibly due to a Priestly redaction (i.e., editing) of a Yahwistic source made some time in the early Persian period (5th century BCE)."}
{"sequence": "The name of the book comes from the two censuses taken of the Israelites."}
{"sequence": "Numbers begins at Mount Sinai, where the Israelites have received their laws and covenant from God and God has taken up residence among them in the sanctuary."}
{"sequence": "The task before them is to take possession of the Promised Land."}
{"sequence": "The people are counted and preparations are made for resuming their march."}
{"sequence": "The Israelites begin the journey, but they \"murmur\" at the hardships along the way, and about the authority of Moses and Aaron."}
{"sequence": "For these acts, God destroys approximately 15,000 of them through various means."}
{"sequence": "They arrive at the borders of Canaan and send spies into the land."}
{"sequence": "Upon hearing the spies' fearful report concerning the conditions in Canaan, the Israelites refuse to take possession of it."}
{"sequence": "God condemns them to death in the wilderness until a new generation can grow up and carry out the task."}
{"sequence": "The book ends with the new generation of Israelites in the Plain of Moab ready for the crossing of the Jordan River."}
{"sequence": "Numbers is the culmination of the story of Israel's exodus from oppression in Egypt and their journey to take possession of the land God promised their fathers."}
{"sequence": "As such it draws to a conclusion the themes introduced in Genesis and played out in Exodus and Leviticus: God has promised the Israelites that they shall become a great (i.e. numerous) nation, that they will have a special relationship with Yahweh their god, and that they shall take possession of the land of Canaan."}
{"sequence": "Numbers also demonstrates the importance of holiness, faithfulness and trust: despite God's presence and his priests, Israel lacks faith and the possession of the land is left to a new generation."}
{"sequence": "Most commentators divide Numbers into three sections based on locale (Mount Sinai, Kadesh-Barnea and the plains of Moab), linked by two travel sections; an alternative is to see it as structured around the two generations of those condemned to die in the wilderness and the new generation who will enter Canaan, making a theological distinction between the disobedience of the first generation and the obedience of the second."}
{"sequence": "God orders Moses, in the wilderness of Sinai, to number those able to bear arms—of all the men \"from twenty years old and upward,\" and to appoint princes over each tribe."}
{"sequence": "A total of 603,550 Israelites are found to be fit for military service."}
{"sequence": "The tribe of Levi is exempted from military service and therefore not included in the census."}
{"sequence": "Moses consecrates the Levites for the service of the Tabernacle in the place of the first-born sons, who hitherto had performed that service."}
{"sequence": "The Levites are divided into three families, the Gershonites, the Kohathites, and the Merarites, each under a chief."}
{"sequence": "The Kohathites were headed by Eleazar, son of Aaron, while the Gershonites and Merarites were headed by Aaron's other son, Ithamar."}
{"sequence": "Preparations are then made for resuming the march to the Promised Land."}
{"sequence": "Various ordinances and laws are decreed."}
{"sequence": "The Israelites set out from Sinai."}
{"sequence": "The people murmur against God and are punished by fire; Moses complains of their stubbornness and is ordered to choose seventy elders to assist him in the government of the people."}
{"sequence": "Miriam and Aaron insult Moses at Hazeroth, which angers God; Miriam is punished with leprosy and is shut out of camp for seven days, at the end of which the Israelites proceed to the desert of Paran on the border of Canaan."}
{"sequence": "Twelve spies are sent out into Canaan and come back to report to Moses."}
{"sequence": "Joshua and Caleb, two of the spies, report that the land is abundant and is \"flowing with milk and honey\", but the other spies say that it is inhabited by giants, and the Israelites refuse to enter the land."}
{"sequence": "Yahweh decrees that the Israelites will be punished for their loss of faith by having to wander in the wilderness for 40 years."}
{"sequence": "Moses is ordered by God to make plates to cover the altar."}
{"sequence": "The children of Israel murmur against Moses and Aaron on account of the destruction of Korah's men and are stricken with the plague, with 14,700 perishing."}
{"sequence": "Aaron and his family are declared by God to be responsible for any iniquity committed in connection with the sanctuary."}
{"sequence": "The Levites are again appointed to help in the keeping of the Tabernacle."}
{"sequence": "The Levites are ordered to surrender to the priests a part of the tithes taken to them."}
{"sequence": "Miriam dies at Kadesh Barnea and the Israelites set out for Moab, on Canaan's eastern border."}
{"sequence": "The Israelites blame Moses for the lack of water."}
{"sequence": "Moses is ordered by God to speak to a rock but initially disobeys, and is punished by the announcement that he shall not enter Canaan."}
{"sequence": "The king of Edom refuses permission to pass through his land and they go around it."}
{"sequence": "Aaron dies on Mount Hor."}
{"sequence": "The Israelites are bitten by Fiery flying serpents for speaking against God and Moses."}
{"sequence": "A brazen serpent is made to ward off these serpents."}
{"sequence": "The Israelites arrive on the plains of Moab."}
{"sequence": "A new census gives the total number of males from twenty years and upward as 601,730, and the number of the Levites from the age of one month and upward as 23,000."}
{"sequence": "The land shall be divided by lot."}
{"sequence": "The daughters of Zelophehad, who had no sons, are to share in the allotment."}
{"sequence": "Moses is ordered to appoint Joshua as his successor."}
{"sequence": "Prescriptions for the observance of the feasts and the offerings for different occasions are enumerated."}
{"sequence": "Moses orders the Israelites to massacre the people of Midian, in retaliation for the Baal-Peor incident."}
{"sequence": "The Reubenites and the Gadites request Moses to assign them the land east of the Jordan."}
{"sequence": "Moses grants their request after they promise to help in the conquest of the land west of the Jordan."}
{"sequence": "The land east of the Jordan is divided among the tribes of Reuben, Gad, and the half-tribe of Manasseh."}
{"sequence": "Moses recalls the stations at which the Israelites halted during their forty years' wanderings and instructs the Israelites to exterminate the Canaanites and destroy their idols."}
{"sequence": "The boundaries of the land are spelled out; the land is to be divided under the supervision of Eleazar, Joshua, and twelve princes, one of each tribe."}
{"sequence": "The majority of modern biblical scholars believe that the Torah (the books of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy) reached its present form in the post-Exilic period (i.e., after c.520 BCE), based on pre-existing written and oral traditions, as well as contemporary geographical and political realities."}
{"sequence": "The five books are often described as being drawn from four \"sources\" - schools of writers rather than individuals - the Yahwist and the Elohist (frequently treated as a single source), the Priestly source and the Deuteronomist."}
{"sequence": "There is an ongoing dispute over the origins of the non-Priestly source(s), but it is generally agreed that the Priestly source is post-exilic."}
{"sequence": "David A. Clines, in his influential \"The Themes of the Pentateuch\" (1978), identified the overarching theme of the five books as the partial fulfilment of a promise made by God to the patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob."}
{"sequence": "The promise has three elements: posterity (i.e., descendants – Abraham is told that his descendants will be as innumerable as the stars), divine-human relationship (Israel is to be God's chosen people), and land (the land of Canaan, cursed by Noah immediately after the Deluge)."}
{"sequence": "The theme of the divine-human relationship is expressed, or managed, through a series of covenants (meaning treaties, legally binding agreements) stretching from Genesis to Deuteronomy and beyond."}
{"sequence": "The first is the covenant between God and Noah immediately after the Deluge in which God agrees never again to destroy the Earth with water."}
{"sequence": "The next is between God and Abraham, and the third between God and all Israel at Mount Sinai."}
{"sequence": "In this third covenant, unlike the first two, God hands down an elaborate set of laws (scattered through Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers), which the Israelites are to observe; they are also to remain faithful to Yahweh, the god of Israel, meaning, among other things, that they must put their trust in his help."}
{"sequence": "The theme of descendants marks the first event in Numbers, the census of Israel's fighting men: the huge number which results (over 600,000) demonstrates the fulfillment of God's promise to Abraham of innumerable descendants, as well as serving as God's guarantee of victory in Canaan."}
{"sequence": "As chapters 1–10 progress, the theme of God's presence with Israel comes to the fore: these chapters describe how Israel is to be organized around the Sanctuary, God's dwelling-place in their midst, under the charge of the Levites and priests, in preparation for the conquest of the land."}
{"sequence": "The Israelites then set out to conquer the land, but almost immediately they refuse to enter it, and Yahweh condemns the whole generation who left Egypt to die in the wilderness."}
{"sequence": "The message is clear: failure was not due to any fault in the preparation, because Yahweh had foreseen everything, but to Israel's sin of unfaithfulness."}
{"sequence": "In the final section, the Israelites of the new generation follow Yahweh's instructions as given through Moses and are successful in all they attempt."}
{"sequence": "The last five chapters are exclusively concerned with land: instructions for the extermination of the Canaanites, the demarcation of the boundaries of the land, how the land is to be divided, holy cities for the Levites and \"cities of refuge\", the problem of pollution of the land by blood, and regulations for inheritance when a male heir is lacking."}
{"sequence": "Jewish translations: Christian translations:"}
{"sequence": "In the narrative of the Hebrew Bible, it covers the time between the conquest described in the Book of Joshua and the establishment of a kingdom in the Books of Samuel, during which biblical judges served as temporary leaders."}
{"sequence": "The stories follow a consistent pattern: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and he therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which he sends in the form of a leader or champion (a \"judge\"; see \"shophet\"); the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression and they prosper, but soon they fall again into unfaithfulness and the cycle is repeated."}
{"sequence": "Scholars consider many of the stories in \"Judges\" to be the oldest in the Deuteronomistic history, with their major redaction dated to the 8th century BCE and with materials such as the Song of Deborah dating from much earlier."}
{"sequence": "\"Judges\" can be divided into three major sections: a double prologue (chapters 1:1–3:6), a main body (3:7–16:31), and a double epilogue (17–21)."}
{"sequence": "The book opens with the Israelites in the land that God has promised to them, but worshiping \"foreign gods\" instead of Yahweh, the God of Israel, and with the Canaanites still present everywhere."}
{"sequence": "Chapters 1:1–2:5 are thus a confession of failure, while chapters 2:6–3:6 are a major summary and reflection from the Deuteronomists."}
{"sequence": "The opening thus sets out the pattern which the stories in the main text will follow: Once peace is regained, Israel does right and receives Yahweh's blessings for a time, but relapses later into doing evil and repeats the pattern set forth above."}
{"sequence": "The Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges suggests that \"the death of Joshua may be regarded as marking the division between the period of conquest and the period of occupation\", the latter being the focus of the Book of Judges."}
{"sequence": "The Israelites meet, most likely at the sanctuary at Gilgal or at Shechem (following on from ) and ask the Lord who should be first (in order of time, not of rank) to secure the land they are to occupy."}
{"sequence": "The cyclical pattern set out in the prologue is readily apparent at the beginning, but as the stories progress it begins to disintegrate, mirroring the disintegration of the world of the Israelites."}
{"sequence": "Although some scholars consider the stories not to be presented in chronological order, the judges in the order in which they appear in the text are: There are also brief glosses on six minor judges: Shamgar (3:31), Tola and Jair (10:1–5), Ibzan, Elon, and Abdon (12:8–15)."}
{"sequence": "Some scholars have inferred that the minor judges were actual adjudicators, whereas the major judges were leaders and did not actually make legal judgements."}
{"sequence": "The only major judge described as making legal judgments is Deborah (4:4)."}
{"sequence": "By the end of Judges, the Israelites are in a worse condition than they were at the beginning, with Yahweh's treasures used to make idolatrous images, the Levites (priests) corrupted, the tribe of Dan conquering a remote village instead of the Canaanite cities, and the tribes of Israel making war on the tribe of Benjamin, their own kinsmen."}
{"sequence": "Judges contains a chronology of its events, assigning a number of years to each interval of judgment and peace."}
{"sequence": "It is overtly schematic and was likely introduced at a later period."}
{"sequence": "Four of the Dead Sea Scrolls feature parts of Judges: 1QJudg, found in Qumran Cave 1; 4QJudg and 4QJudg, found in Qumran Cave 4; and XJudges, a fragment discovered in 2001."}
{"sequence": "The earliest complete surviving copy of the Book of Judges in Hebrew is in the Aleppo Codex (10th century CE)."}
{"sequence": "The Septuagint (Greek translation) is found in early manuscripts such as the Codex Colberto-Sarravianus (c. AD 400; contains many lacunae) and the Fragment of Leipzig (c. AD 500)."}
{"sequence": "It is unclear if any of the people named as judges existed."}
{"sequence": "The basic source for Judges was a collection of loosely connected stories about tribal heroes who saved the people in battle."}
{"sequence": "This original \"book of saviours\" made up of the stories of Ehud, Jael and parts of Gideon, had already been enlarged and transformed into \"wars of Yahweh\" before being given the final Deuteronomistic revision."}
{"sequence": "In the 20th century, the first part of the prologue (chapters 1:1–2:5) and the two parts of the epilogue (17–21) were commonly seen as miscellaneous collections of fragments tacked onto the main text, and the second part of the prologue (2:6–3:6) as an introduction composed expressly for the book."}
{"sequence": "More recently, this view has been challenged, and there is an increasing willingness to see Judges as the work of a single individual, working by carefully selecting, reworking and positioning his source material to introduce and conclude his themes."}
{"sequence": "Twice, this statement is accompanied with the statement \"every man did that which was right in his own eyes\", implying that the redactor is pro-monarchy, ( and ) and the epilogue, in which the tribe of Judah is assigned a leadership role, implies that this redaction took place in Judah."}
{"sequence": "Since the second half of the 20th century most scholars have agreed with Martin Noth's thesis that the books of Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings form parts of a single work."}
{"sequence": "Noth maintained that the history was written in the early Exilic period (6th century BCE) in order to demonstrate how Israel's history was worked out in accordance with the theology expressed in the book of Deuteronomy (which thus provides the name \"Deuteronomistic\")."}
{"sequence": "Noth believed that this history was the work of a single author, living in the mid-6th century BCE, selecting, editing and composing from his sources to produce a coherent work."}
{"sequence": "Frank Moore Cross later proposed that an early version of the history was composed in Jerusalem in Josiah's time (late 7th century BCE); this first version, Dtr1, was then revised and expanded to create a second edition, that identified by Noth, and which Cross labelled Dtr2."}
{"sequence": "Scholars agree that the Deuteronomists' hand can be seen in \"Judges\" through the book's cyclical nature: the Israelites fall into idolatry, God punishes them for their sins with oppression by foreign peoples, the Israelites cry out to God for help, and God sends a judge to deliver them from the foreign oppression."}
{"sequence": "After a period of peace, the cycle recurs."}
{"sequence": "The essence of Deuteronomistic theology is that Israel has entered into a covenant (a treaty, a binding agreement) with the God Yahweh, under which they agree to accept Yahweh as their God (hence the phrase \"God of Israel\") and Yahweh promises them a land where they can live in peace and prosperity."}
{"sequence": "Deuteronomy contains the laws by which Israel is to live in the promised land, Joshua chronicles the conquest of Canaan, the promised land, and its allotment among the tribes, Judges describes the settlement of the land, Samuel the consolidation of the land and people under David, and Kings the destruction of kingship and loss of the land."}
{"sequence": "The final tragedy described in Kings is the result of Israel's failure to uphold its part of the covenant: faithfulness to Yahweh brings success, economic, military and political, but unfaithfulness brings defeat and oppression."}
{"sequence": "This is the theme played out in Judges: the people are unfaithful to Yahweh and He therefore delivers them into the hands of their enemies; the people then repent and entreat Yahweh for mercy, which He sends in the form of a judge; the judge delivers the Israelites from oppression, but after a while they fall into unfaithfulness again and the cycle is repeated."}
{"sequence": "Israel's apostasy is repeatedly invoked by the author as the cause of threats to Israel."}
{"sequence": "The oppression of the Israelites is due to their turning to Canaanite gods, breaking the covenant and \"doing evil in the sight of the lord\"."}
{"sequence": "Further themes are also present: the \"sovereign freedom of Yahweh\" (God does not always do what is expected of him); the \"satirisation of foreign kings\" (who consistently underestimate Israel and Yahweh); the concept of the \"flawed agent\" (judges who are not adequate to the task before them) and the disunity of the Israelite community (which gathers pace as the stories succeed one another)."}
{"sequence": "The book is as intriguing for the themes it leaves out as for what it includes: the Ark of the Covenant, which is given so much importance in the stories of Moses and Joshua, is almost entirely missing, cooperation between the various tribes is limited, and there is no mention of a central shrine for worship and only limited reference to a High Priest of Israel (the office to which Aaron was appointed at the end of the Exodus story)."}
{"sequence": "Although \"Judges\" probably had a monarchist redaction (see above), the book contains passages and themes that represent anti-monarchist views."}
{"sequence": "One of the major themes of the book is Yahweh's sovereignty and the importance of being loyal to Him and His laws above all other gods and sovereigns."}
{"sequence": "Indeed, the authority of the judges comes not through prominent dynasties nor through elections or appointments, but rather through the Spirit of God."}
{"sequence": "Anti-monarchist theology is most apparent toward the end of the Gideon cycle in which the Israelites beg Gideon to create a dynastic monarchy over them and Gideon refuses."}
{"sequence": "The rest of Gideon's lifetime saw peace in the land, but after Gideon's death, his son Abimelech ruled Shechem as a Machiavellian tyrant guilty for much bloodshed (see chapters 8 and 9)."}
{"sequence": "However, the last few chapters of \"Judges\" (specifically, the stories of Samson, Micah, and Gibeah) highlight the violence and anarchy of decentralized rule."}
{"sequence": "\"Judges\" is remarkable for the number of female characters who \"play significant roles, active and passive, in the narratives.\""}
{"sequence": "Rabbi Joseph Telushkin wrote,"}
{"sequence": "Books of Samuel The Books of Samuel forms part of the narrative history of Israel in the Nevi'im or \"prophets\" section of the Hebrew Bible/Old Testament called the Deuteronomistic history, a series of books (Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and Kings) that constitute a theological history of the Israelites and aim to explain God's law for Israel under the guidance of the prophets."}
{"sequence": "According to Jewish tradition, the book was written by Samuel, with additions by the prophets Gad and Nathan."}
{"sequence": "Modern scholarly thinking is that the entire Deuteronomistic history was composed in the period c. 630–540 BC by combining a number of independent texts of various ages."}
{"sequence": "Samuel begins with the prophet Samuel's birth and God's call to him as a boy."}
{"sequence": "The story of the Ark of the Covenant that follows tells of Israel's oppression by the Philistines, which brought about Samuel's anointing of Saul as Israel's first king."}
{"sequence": "God then promised David and his successors an everlasting dynasty."}
{"sequence": "The childless Hannah vows to Yahweh of hosts that if she has a son, he will be dedicated to him."}
{"sequence": "Eli, the priest of Shiloh (where the Ark of the Covenant is located), blesses her, and a child named Samuel is born."}
{"sequence": "Samuel is dedicated to the Lord as a Nazirite – the only one besides Samson to be identified in the Bible."}
{"sequence": "Eli's sons, Hophni and Phinehas, sin against God's laws and the people, which cause them to die in the battle of Aphek, but the child Samuel grows up \"in the presence of the Lord.\""}
{"sequence": "The Philistines capture the Ark of the Covenant from Shiloh and take it to the temple of their god Dagon, who recognizes the supremacy of Yahweh."}
{"sequence": "The Philistines are afflicted with plagues and return the ark to the Israelites, but to the territory of the tribe of Benjamin rather than to Shiloh."}
{"sequence": "The Philistines attack the Israelites gathered at Mizpah in Benjamin."}
{"sequence": "Samuel appeals to Yahweh, the Philistines are decisively beaten, and the Israelites reclaim their lost territory."}
{"sequence": "In Samuel's old age, he appoints his sons Joel and Abijah as judges, but because of their corruption the people ask for a king to rule over them."}
{"sequence": "God directs Samuel to grant them a king despite his concerns, and gives them Saul from the tribe of Benjamin."}
{"sequence": "Shortly after Saul leads Israel to victory over Nahash of Ammon."}
{"sequence": "Despite his numerous military victories, Saul disobeys Yahweh's instruction of destroying Amalek by sparing the Amalekite ruler and the best portion of their flocks to present them as sacrifices."}
{"sequence": "Samuel rebukes Saul and tells him that God has chosen another man to be king of Israel."}
{"sequence": "God tells Samuel to anoint David of Bethlehem as king, and David enters Saul's court as his armor-bearer and harpist."}
{"sequence": "Saul's son and heir Jonathan befriends David and recognizes him as the rightful king."}
{"sequence": "Saul plots David's death, but David flees into the wilderness, where he becomes a champion of the Hebrews."}
{"sequence": "David joins the Philistines but continues secretly to champion his own people, until Saul and Jonathan are killed in battle at Mount Gilboa."}
{"sequence": "At this point, David offers a majestic eulogy, where he praises the bravery and magnificence of both his friend Jonathan and King Saul."}
{"sequence": "The elders of Judah anoint David as king, but in the north Saul's son Ish-bosheth, or Ishbaal, rules over the northern tribes."}
{"sequence": "After a long war, Ishbaal is murdered by Rechab and Baanah, two of his captains who hope for a reward from David; but David has them killed for killing God's anointed."}
{"sequence": "David is then anointed King of all Israel."}
{"sequence": "David captures Jerusalem and brings the Ark there."}
{"sequence": "David wishes to build a temple, but Nathan tells him that one of his sons will be the one to build the temple."}
{"sequence": "David defeats the enemies of Israel, slaughtering Philistines, Moabites, Edomites, Syrians and Arameans."}
{"sequence": "David commits adultery with Bathsheba, who becomes pregnant."}
{"sequence": "When her husband, Uriah the Hittite returns from battle, David encourages him to go home and see his wife but Uriah declines in case David might need him."}
{"sequence": "David thus deliberately sends Uriah on a suicide mission; and for this, Yahweh sends disasters against his house."}
{"sequence": "Nathan tells David that the sword shall never depart from his house."}
{"sequence": "For the remainder of his reign there are problems."}
{"sequence": "Amnon (one of David's sons) rapes his half-sister Tamar (one of David's daughters)."}
{"sequence": "Absalom (another son of David) kills Amnon, rebels against his father, and David flees from Jerusalem."}

{"sequence": "Finally only two contenders for the succession remain, Adonijah, son of David and Haggith, and Solomon, son of David and Bathsheba."}
{"sequence": "The Second Book of Samuel concludes with four chapters (chapters 21 to 24) which lie outside the chronological narrative of Saul and David."}
{"sequence": "The narrative is resumed with the first Book of Kings, which relates how, as David lies dying, Bathsheba and Nathan ensure Solomon's elevation to the throne."}
{"sequence": "The four supplementary chapters cover a great famine during David's reign, the execution of seven of Saul's remaining descendants, only Mephibosheth being saved, David's song of thanksgiving, which is almost identical to Psalm 18, his last words, a list of David's \"mighty warriors\", an offering made by David using water from the well of Bethlehem, David's sinful census, a plague over Israel which David opted for as preferable to either famine or oppression, and the construction of an altar on land he purchased from Araunah the Jebusite."}
{"sequence": "What it is now commonly known as 1 Samuel and 2 Samuel are called by the Vulgate, in imitation of the Septuagint, 1 Kings and 2 Kings respectively."}
{"sequence": "Then, what are now commonly known as 1 Kings and 2 Kings would be 3 Kings and 4 Kings in old Bibles before the year 1516."}
{"sequence": "It was in 1517 that use of the division we know now today used by Protestant Bibles and adopted by Catholics began."}
{"sequence": "Some Bibles still preserve the old denomination, for example, the Douay-Rheims Bible."}
{"sequence": "1 and 2 Samuel were originally (and, in most Jewish bibles, still are) a single book, but the first Greek translation, called Septuagint and produced around the second century BC, divided it into two; this was adopted by the Latin translations used in the early Christian church of the West, and finally introduced into Jewish bibles around the early 16th century."}
{"sequence": "The Hebrew text, that is used by Jews today, called the Masoretic text, differs considerably from the Hebrew text that was the basis of the first Greek translation, and scholars are still working at finding the best solutions to the many problems this presents."}
{"sequence": "According to passages 14b and 15a of the Bava Basra tractate of the Talmud, the book was written by Samuel up until 1 Samuel 25, which notes the death of Samuel, and the remainder by the prophets Gad and Nathan."}
{"sequence": "Critical scholars from the 19th century onward have rejected this idea."}
{"sequence": "However, even prior to this, the medieval Jewish commentator Isaac Abarbanel noted that the presence of anachronistic expressions (such as \"to this day\" and \"in the past\") indicated that there must have been a later editor such as Jeremiah or Ezra."}
{"sequence": "Martin Noth in 1943 theorized that Samuel was composed by a single author as part of a history of Israel: the Deuteronomistic history (made up of Deuteronomy, Joshua, Judges, Samuel and Kings)."}
{"sequence": "Although Noth's belief that the entire history was composed by a single individual has been largely abandoned, his theory in its broad outline has been adopted by most scholars."}
{"sequence": "The Deuteronomistic view is that an early version of the history was composed in the time of king Hezekiah (8th century BC); the bulk of the first edition dates from his grandson Josiah at the end of the 7th BC, with further sections added during the Babylonian exile (6th century BC) and the work was substantially complete by about 550 BC."}
{"sequence": "Further editing was apparently done even after then."}
{"sequence": "For example, A. Graeme Auld, Professor of Hebrew Bible at the University of Edinburgh, contends that the silver quarter-shekel which Saul's servant offers to Samuel in 1 Samuel 9 \"almost certainly fixes the date of this story in the Persian or Hellenistic period\" because a quarter-shekel was known to exist in Hasmonean times."}
{"sequence": "The 6th century BC authors and editors responsible for the bulk of the history drew on many earlier sources, including (but not limited to) an \"ark narrative\" (1 Samuel 4:1–7:1 and perhaps part of 2 Samuel 6), a \"Saul cycle\" (parts of 1 Samuel 9–11 and 13–14), the \"history of David's rise\" (1 Samuel 16:14–2 Samuel 5:10), and the \"succession narrative\" (2 Samuel 9–20 and 1 Kings 1–2)."}
{"sequence": "The oldest of these, the \"ark narrative,\" may even predate the Davidic era."}
{"sequence": "This view of late compilation for Samuel has faced serious scholarly opposition on the basis that evidence for the Deuteronimistic history is scant, and that Deuteronimistic advocates are not in consensus as to the origin and extent of the History."}
{"sequence": "Secondly, the basic theological concerns identified with the Deuteronimistic school are tenets central to Hebrew theology in texts that are widely regarded as predating Josiah."}
{"sequence": "Thirdly, there are notable differences in style and thematic emphasis between Deuteronomy and Samuel."}
{"sequence": "Finally, there are widely acknowledged structural parallels between the Hittite suzerain treaty of the second millennium BC and the Book of Deuteronomy itself, far before the time of Josiah."}
{"sequence": "The alternative view is that it is difficult to determine when the events of Samuel were recorded: \"There are no particularly persuasive reasons to date the sources used by the compiler later than the early tenth century events themselves, and good reason to believe that contemporary records were kept (cf."}
{"sequence": "2 Sam."}
{"sequence": "The sources used to construct 1 and 2 Samuel are believed to include the following: Three of the Dead Sea Scrolls feature parts of Kings: 1QSam, found in Qumran Cave 1, contains parts of 2 Samuel; and 4QSam, 4QSam and 4QSam, all found in Qumran Cave 4."}
{"sequence": "Collectively they are known as The Samuel Scroll and date from the 2nd and 1st century BCE."}
{"sequence": "The earliest complete surviving copy of the book(s) of Samuel is in the Aleppo Codex (10th century CE)."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Samuel is a theological evaluation of kingship in general and of dynastic kingship and David in particular."}
{"sequence": "The main themes of the book are introduced in the opening poem (the \"Song of Hannah\"): (1) the sovereignty of Yahweh, God of Israel; (2) the reversal of human fortunes; and (3) kingship."}
{"sequence": "These themes are played out in the stories of the three main characters, Samuel, Saul and David."}
{"sequence": "Samuel answers the description of the \"prophet like Moses\" predicted in Deuteronomy 18:15–22: like Moses, he has direct contact with Yahweh, acts as a judge, and is a perfect leader who never makes mistakes."}
{"sequence": "Samuel's successful defense of the Israelites against their enemies demonstrates that they have no need for a king (who will, moreover, introduce inequality), yet despite this the people demand a king."}
{"sequence": "But the king they are given is Yahweh's gift, and Samuel explains that kingship can be a blessing rather than a curse if they remain faithful to their God."}
{"sequence": "On the other hand, total destruction of both king and people will result if they turn to wickedness."}
{"sequence": "Saul is the chosen one, tall, handsome and \"goodly\", a king appointed by Yahweh, and anointed by Samuel, Yahweh's prophet, and yet he is ultimately rejected."}
{"sequence": "Saul has two faults which make him unfit for the office of king: carrying out a sacrifice in place of Samuel (1 Samuel 13:8–14), and failing to exterminate the Amalekites, in accordance to God's commands, and trying to compensate by claiming that he reserved the surviving Amalekite livestock for sacrifice (1 Samuel 15)."}
{"sequence": "One of the main units within Samuel is the \"History of David's Rise\", the purpose of which is to justify David as the legitimate successor to Saul."}
{"sequence": "The narrative stresses that he gained the throne lawfully, always respecting \"the Lord's anointed\" (i.e. Saul) and never taking any of his numerous chances to seize the throne by violence."}
{"sequence": "As God's chosen king over Israel, David is also the son of God (\"I will be a father to him, and he shall be a son to me...\" – 2 Samuel 7:14)."}
{"sequence": "God enters into an eternal covenant (treaty) with David and his line, promising divine protection of the dynasty and of Jerusalem through all time."}
{"sequence": "2 Samuel 23 contains a prophetic statement described as the \"last words of David\" (verses 1–7) and details of the 37 \"mighty men\" who were David's chief warriors (verses 8–39)."}
{"sequence": "The Jerusalem Bible states that last words were attributed to David in the style of Jacob (see Jacob's Blessing, ) and Moses (see Blessing of Moses, )."}
{"sequence": "Its editors note that \"the text has suffered considerably and reconstructions are conjectural\"."}
{"sequence": "Book of Revelation The Book of Revelation (also called the Apocalypse of John, Revelation to John or Revelation from Jesus Christ) is the final book of the New Testament, and consequently is also the final book of the Christian Bible."}
{"sequence": "Its title is derived from the first word of the Koine Greek text: \"apokalypsis\", meaning \"unveiling\" or \"revelation.\""}
{"sequence": "The Book of Revelation is the only apocalyptic book in the New Testament canon."}
{"sequence": "Thus, it occupies a central place in Christian eschatology."}
{"sequence": "The author names himself as \"John\" in the text, but his precise identity remains a point of academic debate."}
{"sequence": "Second-century Christian writers such as Justin Martyr, Irenaeus, Melito (the bishop of Sardis), Clement of Alexandria, and the author of the Muratorian fragment identify John the Apostle as the \"John\" of Revelation."}
{"sequence": "Modern scholarship generally takes a different view, with many considering that nothing can be known about the author except that he was a Christian prophet."}
{"sequence": "Some modern scholars characterize Revelation's author as a putative figure whom they call \"John of Patmos\"."}
{"sequence": "The bulk of traditional sources date the book to the reign of the Roman emperor Domitian (AD 81–96), which evidence tends to confirm."}
{"sequence": "The book spans three literary genres: the epistolary, the apocalyptic, and the prophetic."}
{"sequence": "It begins with John, on the island of Patmos in the Aegean Sea, addressing a letter to the \"Seven Churches of Asia\"."}
{"sequence": "He then describes a series of prophetic visions, including of figures such as the Seven-Headed Dragon, the Serpent, and the Beast, which culminate in the Second Coming of Jesus."}
{"sequence": "The obscure and extravagant imagery has led to a wide variety of Christian interpretations."}
{"sequence": "Historicist interpretations see Revelation as containing a broad view of history, whilst preterist interpretations treat Revelation as mostly referring to the events of the Apostolic Age (1st century), or, at the latest, the fall of the Roman Empire."}
{"sequence": "Futurists, meanwhile, believe that Revelation describes future events, with the seven churches growing into the body/believers throughout the age, and a reemergence or continuous rule of a Roman/Graeco system with modern capabilities described by John in ways familiar to him, and idealist or symbolic interpretations consider that Revelation does not refer to actual people or events, but is an allegory of the spiritual path and the ongoing struggle between good and evil."}
{"sequence": "The name \"Revelation\" comes from the first word of the book in Koine Greek: ἀποκάλυψις (\"apokalypsis\"), which means \"unveiling\" or \"revelation\"."}
{"sequence": "The author names himself as \"John\", but modern scholars consider it unlikely that the author of Revelation also wrote the Gospel of John."}
{"sequence": "He was a Jewish Christian prophet, probably belonging to a group of such prophets, and was accepted by the congregations to whom he addresses his letter."}
{"sequence": "The book is commonly dated to about 95 AD, as suggested by clues in the visions pointing to the reign of the emperor Domitian."}
{"sequence": "The beast with seven heads and the number 666 seem to allude directly to the emperor Nero (reigned AD 54–68), but this does not require that Revelation was written in the 60s, as there was a widespread belief in later decades that Nero would return."}
{"sequence": "Revelation is an apocalyptic prophecy with an epistolary introduction addressed to seven churches in the Roman province of Asia. \""}
{"sequence": "Apocalypse\" means the revealing of divine mysteries; John is to write down what is revealed (what he sees in his vision) and send it to the seven churches."}
{"sequence": "The entire book constitutes the letter—the letters to the seven individual churches are introductions to the rest of the book, which is addressed to all seven."}
{"sequence": "While the dominant genre is apocalyptic, the author sees himself as a Christian prophet: Revelation uses the word in various forms twenty-one times, more than any other New Testament book."}
{"sequence": "The predominant view is that Revelation alludes to the Old Testament although it is difficult among scholars to agree on the exact number of allusions or the allusions themselves."}
{"sequence": "Revelation rarely quotes directly from the Old Testament, yet almost every verse alludes to or echoes older scriptures."}
{"sequence": "Over half of the references stem from Daniel, Ezekiel, Psalms, and Isaiah, with Daniel providing the largest number in proportion to length and Ezekiel standing out as the most influential."}
{"sequence": "Because these references appear as allusions rather than as quotes, it is difficult to know whether the author used the Hebrew or the Greek version of the Hebrew scriptures, but he was clearly often influenced by the Greek."}
{"sequence": "He very frequently combines multiple references, and again the allusional style makes it impossible to be certain to what extent he did so consciously."}
{"sequence": "Conventional understanding until recent times was that the Book of Revelation was written to comfort beleaguered Christians as they underwent persecution at the hands of a megalomaniacal Roman emperor, but much of this has now been jettisoned: Domitian is no longer viewed as a despot imposing an imperial cult, and it is no longer believed that there was any systematic empire-wide persecution of Christians in his time."}
{"sequence": "The current view is that Revelation was composed in the context of a conflict within the Christian community of Asia Minor over whether to engage with, or withdraw from, the far larger non-Christian community: Revelation chastises those Christians who wanted to reach an accommodation with the Roman cult of empire."}
{"sequence": "This is not to say that Christians in Roman Asia were not suffering, for withdrawal from, and defiance against, the wider Roman society, which imposed very real penalties; Revelation offered a victory over this reality by offering an apocalyptic hope: in the words of professor Adela Yarbro Collins, \"What ought to be was experienced as a present reality.\""}
{"sequence": "Revelation was among the last books accepted into the Christian biblical canon, and to the present day some churches that derive from the Church of the East reject it."}
{"sequence": "Eastern Christians became skeptical of the book as doubts concerning its authorship and unusual style were reinforced by aversion to its acceptance by Montanists and other groups considered to be heretical."}
{"sequence": "This distrust of the Book of Revelation persisted in the East through the 15th century."}
{"sequence": "Dionysius (248 AD), bishop of Alexandria and disciple of Origen, wrote that the Book of Revelation could have been written by Cerinthus although he himself did not adopt the view that Cerinthus was the writer."}
{"sequence": "He regarded the Apocalypse as the work of an inspired man but not of an Apostle \"(Eusebius, Church History VII.25)\"."}
{"sequence": "Eusebius, in his Church History (c. 330 AD) mentioned that the Apocalypse of John was accepted as a Canonical book and rejected at the same time: The Apocalypse of John is counted as both accepted (Kirsopp."}
{"sequence": "Lake translation: \"Recognized\") and disputed, which has caused some confusion over what exactly Eusebius meant by doing so."}
{"sequence": "The disputation can perhaps be attributed to Origen."}
{"sequence": "Origen seems to have accepted it in his writings."}
{"sequence": "Cyril of Jerusalem (348 AD) does not name it among the canonical books (Catechesis IV.33–36)."}
{"sequence": "Athanasius (367 AD) in his \"Letter 39\", Augustine of Hippo (c. 397 AD) in his book \"On Christian Doctrine\" (Book II, Chapter 8), Tyrannius Rufinus (c. 400 AD) in his \"Commentary on the Apostles' Creed\", Pope Innocent I (405 AD) in a letter to the bishop of Toulouse and John of Damascus (about 730 AD) in his work \"An Exposition of the Orthodox Faith (Book IV:7)\" listed \"the Revelation of John the Evangelist\" as a canonical book."}
{"sequence": "The Council of Laodicea (363) omits it as a canonical book."}
{"sequence": "The \"Decretum Gelasianum\", which is a work written by an anonymous scholar between 519 and 553, contains a list of books of scripture presented as having been reckoned as canonical by the Council of Rome (382 AD)."}
{"sequence": "This list mentions it as a part of the New Testament canon."}
{"sequence": "The Synod of Hippo (in 393), followed by the Council of Carthage (397), the Council of Carthage (419), the Council of Florence (1442 AD) and the Council of Trent (1546 AD) classified it as a canonical book."}
{"sequence": "The Apostolic Canons, approved by the Eastern Orthodox Council in Trullo in 692, but rejected by Pope Sergius I, omit it."}
{"sequence": "Doubts resurfaced during the 16th-century Protestant Reformation."}
{"sequence": "Martin Luther called Revelation \"neither apostolic nor prophetic\" in the 1522 preface to his translation of the New Testament (he revised his position with a much more favorable assessment in 1530), Huldrych Zwingli labelled it \"not a book of the Bible\", and it was the only New Testament book on which John Calvin did not write a commentary."}
{"sequence": "Revelation remains the only New Testament book not read in the Divine Liturgy of the Eastern Orthodox Church, though Catholic and Protestant liturgies include it."}
{"sequence": "There are approximately 300 Greek manuscripts of Revelation."}
{"sequence": "While it is not extant in Codex Vaticanus (4th century), it is extant in the other great uncial codices: Sinaiticus (4th century), Alexandrinus (5th century), and Ephraemi Rescriptus (5th century)."}
{"sequence": "In addition, there are numerous papyri, especially and (both 3rd century); minuscules (8th to 10th century); and fragmentary quotations in the Church fathers of the 2nd to 5th centuries and the 6th-century Greek commentary on Revelation by Andreas."}
{"sequence": "Divisions in the book seem to be marked by the repetition of key phrases, by the arrangement of subject matter into blocks, and associated with its Christological passages, and much use is made of significant numbers, especially the number seven, which represented perfection according to ancient numerology."}
{"sequence": "Nevertheless, there is a \"complete lack of consensus\" among scholars about the structure of Revelation."}
{"sequence": "The following is therefore an outline of the book's contents rather than of its structure."}
{"sequence": "Revelation has a wide variety of interpretations, ranging from the simple historical interpretation, to a prophetic view on what will happen in the future by way of the Will of God and the Woman's victory on Satan (\"symbolic interpretation\"), to different end time scenarios (\"futurist interpretation\"), to the views of critics who deny any spiritual value to Revelation at all, ascribing it to a human-inherited archetype."}
{"sequence": "This interpretation, which has found expression among both Catholic and Protestant theologians, considers the liturgical worship, particularly the Easter rites, of early Christianity as background and context for understanding the Book of Revelation's structure and significance."}
{"sequence": "This perspective is explained in \"The Paschal Liturgy and the Apocalypse\" (new edition, 2004) by Massey H. Shepherd, an Episcopal scholar, and in Scott Hahn's \"The Lamb's Supper: The Mass as Heaven on Earth\" (1999), in which he states that Revelation in form is structured after creation, fall, judgment and redemption."}
{"sequence": "Those who hold this view say that the Temple's destruction (AD 70) had a profound effect on the Jewish people, not only in Jerusalem but among the Greek-speaking Jews of the Mediterranean."}
{"sequence": "They believe the Book of Revelation provides insight into the early Eucharist, saying that it is the new Temple worship in the New Heaven and Earth."}
{"sequence": "The idea of the Eucharist as a foretaste of the heavenly banquet is also explored by British Methodist Geoffrey Wainwright in his book \"Eucharist and Eschatology\" (Oxford University Press, 1980)."}
{"sequence": "According to Pope Benedict XVI some of the images of Revelation should be understood in the context of the dramatic suffering and persecution of the churches of Asia in the 1st century."}
{"sequence": "Accordingly, the Book of Revelation should not be read as an enigmatic warning, but as an encouraging vision of Christ's definitive victory over evil."}
{"sequence": "In the Coptic Orthodox Church the whole Book of Revelation is read during Apocalypse Night or Good Friday."}
{"sequence": "Most Christian interpretations fall into one or more of the following categories: Eastern Orthodoxy treats the text as simultaneously describing contemporaneous events (events occurring at the same time) and as prophecy of events to come, for which the contemporaneous events were a form of foreshadow."}
{"sequence": "It rejects attempts to determine, before the fact, if the events of Revelation are occurring by mapping them onto present-day events, taking to heart the Scriptural warning against those who proclaim \"He is here!\""}
{"sequence": "prematurely."}
{"sequence": "Instead, the book is seen as a warning to be spiritually and morally ready for the end times, whenever they may come (\"as a thief in the night\"), but they will come at the time of God's choosing, not something that can be precipitated nor trivially deduced by mortals."}
{"sequence": "This view is also held by many Catholics, although there is a diversity of opinion about the nature of the Apocalypse within Catholicism."}
{"sequence": "Book of Revelation is the only book of the New Testament that is not read during services by the Byzantine Rite Churches although in the Western Rite Orthodox Parishes, which are under the same bishops as the Byzantine Rite, it is read."}
{"sequence": "The early Protestants followed a historicist interpretation of the Bible, which identified the Pope as the Antichrist."}
{"sequence": "Similar to the early Protestants, Adventists maintain a historicist interpretation of the Bible's predictions of the apocalypse."}
{"sequence": "Seventh-day Adventists believe the Book of Revelation is especially relevant to believers in the days preceding the second coming of Jesus Christ. \""}
{"sequence": "The universal church is composed of all who truly believe in Christ, but in the last days, a time of widespread apostasy, a remnant has been called out to keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\" \""}
{"sequence": "Here is the patience of the saints; here are those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus.\""}
{"sequence": "As participatory agents in the work of salvation for all humankind, \"This remnant announces the arrival of the judgment hour, proclaims salvation through Christ, and heralds the approach of His second advent.\""}
{"sequence": "The three angels of Revelation 14 represent the people who accept the light of God's messages and go forth as His agents to sound the warning throughout the length and breadth of the earth."}
{"sequence": "By the analogous reasoning between the Millerite historicism, and Baha'u'llah's doctrine of progressive revelation, a modified historicist method of interpreting prophecy has become integrated in foremost American Bahá'í teachings."}
{"sequence": "'Abdu'l-Bahá has given some interpretations about the 11th and 12th chapters of Revelation in \"Some Answered Questions\"."}
{"sequence": "The 1,260 days spoken of in the forms: one thousand two hundred and sixty days, forty-two months, refers to the 1,260 years in the Islamic Calendar (AH 1260 or 1844 AD)."}
{"sequence": "The \"two witnesses\" spoken of are Muhammad and Ali."}
{"sequence": "Also, the Bible reads, \"And there appeared a great wonder in heaven; and behold a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and seven crowns upon his heads\"."}
{"sequence": "The seven heads of the dragon are symbolic of the seven provinces dominated by the Umayyads: Damascus, Persia, Arabia, Egypt, Africa, Andalusia, and Transoxania."}
{"sequence": "The ten horns represent the ten names of the leaders of the Umayyad dynasty: Abu Sufyan, Muawiya, Yazid, Marwan, Abd al-Malik, Walid, Sulayman, Umar, Hisham, and Ibrahim."}
{"sequence": "Some names were re-used, as in the case of Yazid II and Yazid III and the like, which were not counted for this interpretation."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Mormon states that John the Apostle is the author of Revelation and that he was foreordained by God to write it."}
{"sequence": "Doctrine and Covenants, section 77, postulates answers to specific questions regarding the symbolism contained in the Book of Revelation."}
{"sequence": "Topics include: the sea of glass, the four beasts and their appearance, the 24 elders, the book with seven seals, certain angels, the sealing of the 144,000, the little book eaten by John, and the two witnesses in Chapter 11."}
{"sequence": "Members of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints believe that the warning contained in Revelation 22:18–19 does not refer to the biblical canon as a whole."}
{"sequence": "Rather, an open and ongoing dialogue between God and the modern-day Prophet and Apostles of the LDS faith constitute an open canon of scripture."}
{"sequence": "Christian Gnostics, however, are unlikely to be attracted to the teaching of Revelation because the doctrine of salvation through the sacrificed Lamb, which is central to Revelation, is repugnant to Gnostics."}
{"sequence": "Christian Gnostics \"believed in the Forgiveness of Sins, but in no vicarious sacrifice for sin ... they accepted Christ in the full realisation of the word; his life, not his death, was the keynote of their doctrine and their practice.\""}
{"sequence": "James Morgan Pryse was an esoteric gnostic who saw Revelation as a western version of the Hindu theory of the Chakra."}
{"sequence": "He began his work, \"The purpose of this book is to show that the Apocalypse is a manual of spiritual development and not, as conventionally interpreted, a cryptic history or prophecy.\""}
{"sequence": "Such diverse theories have failed to command widespread acceptance."}
{"sequence": "But Christopher Rowland argues: \"there are always going to be loose threads which refuse to be woven into the fabric as a whole."}
{"sequence": "The presence of the threads which stubbornly refuse to be incorporated into the neat tapestry of our world-view does not usually totally undermine that view.\""}
{"sequence": "The radical discipleship interpretation asserts that the Book of Revelation is best understood as a handbook for radical discipleship; i. e., how to remain faithful to the spirit and teachings of Jesus and avoid simply assimilating to surrounding society."}
{"sequence": "In this interpretation the primary agenda of the book is to expose as impostors the worldly powers that seek to oppose the ways of God and God's Kingdom."}
{"sequence": "The chief temptation for Christians in the 1st century, and today, is to fail to hold fast to the non-violent teachings and example of Jesus and instead be lured into unquestioning adoption and assimilation of worldly, national or cultural values – imperialism, nationalism, and civil religion being the most dangerous and insidious."}
{"sequence": "This perspective (closely related to liberation theology) draws on the approach of Bible scholars such as Ched Myers, William Stringfellow, Richard Horsley, Daniel Berrigan, Wes Howard-Brook, and Joerg Rieger."}
{"sequence": "Various Christian anarchists, such as Jacques Ellul, have identified the State and political power as the Beast and the events described, being their doings and results, the aforementioned 'wrath'."}
{"sequence": "Literary writers and theorists have contributed to a wide range of theories about the origins and purpose of the Book of Revelation."}
{"sequence": "Some of these writers have no connection with established Christian faiths but, nevertheless, found in Revelation a source of inspiration."}
{"sequence": "Revelation has been approached from Hindu philosophy and Jewish Midrash."}
{"sequence": "Others have pointed to aspects of composition which have been ignored such as the similarities of prophetic inspiration to modern poetic inspiration, or the parallels with Greek drama."}
{"sequence": "In recent years, theories have arisen which concentrate upon how readers and texts interact to create meaning and which are less interested in what the original author intended."}
{"sequence": "Charles Cutler Torrey taught Semitic languages at Yale University."}
{"sequence": "His lasting contribution has been to show how prophets, such as the scribe of Revelation, are much more meaningful when treated as poets first and foremost."}
{"sequence": "He thought this was a point often lost sight of because most English bibles render everything in prose."}
{"sequence": "Poetry was also the reason John never directly quoted the older prophets."}
{"sequence": "Had he done so, he would have had to use their (Hebrew) poetry whereas he wanted to write his own."}
{"sequence": "Torrey insisted Revelation had originally been written in Aramaic."}
{"sequence": "According to Torrey \"The Fourth Gospel was brought to Ephesus by a Christian fugitive from Palestine soon after the middle of the first century."}
{"sequence": "It was written in Aramaic.\""}
{"sequence": "Later, the Ephesians claimed this fugitive had actually been the beloved disciple himself."}
{"sequence": "Subsequently, this John was banished by Nero and died on Patmos after writing Revelation."}
{"sequence": "Torrey argued that until AD 80, when Christians were expelled from the synagogues, the Christian message was always first heard in the synagogue and, for cultural reasons, the evangelist would have spoken in Aramaic, else \"he would have had no hearing.\""}
{"sequence": "Torrey showed how the three major songs in Revelation (the new song, the song of Moses and the Lamb and the chorus at 19: 6–8) each fall naturally into four regular metrical lines plus a coda."}
{"sequence": "Other dramatic moments in Revelation, such as 6:16 where the terrified people cry out to be hidden, behave in a similar way."}
{"sequence": "The surviving Greek translation was a literal translation that aimed to comply with the warning at Revelation 22:18 that the text must not be \"corrupted\" in any way."}
{"sequence": "Christina Rossetti was a Victorian poet who believed the sensual excitement of the natural world found its meaningful purpose in death and in God."}
{"sequence": "Her \"The Face of the Deep\" is a meditation upon the Apocalypse."}
{"sequence": "In her view, what Revelation has to teach is patience."}
{"sequence": "Patience is the closest to perfection the human condition allows."}
{"sequence": "Her book, which is largely written in prose, frequently breaks into poetry or jubilation, much like Revelation itself."}
{"sequence": "The relevance of John's visions belongs to Christians of all times as a continuous present meditation."}
{"sequence": "Such matters are eternal and outside of normal human reckoning. \""}
{"sequence": "That winter which will be the death of Time has no promise of termination."}
{"sequence": "Winter that returns not to spring ... – who can bear it?\""}
{"sequence": "She dealt deftly with the vengeful aspects of John's message. \""}
{"sequence": "A few are charged to do judgment; everyone without exception is charged to show mercy.\""}
{"sequence": "Her conclusion is that Christians should see John as \"representative of all his brethren\" so they should \"hope as he hoped, love as he loved.\""}
{"sequence": "Recently, aesthetic and literary modes of interpretation have developed, which focus on Revelation as a work of art and imagination, viewing the imagery as symbolic depictions of timeless truths and the victory of good over evil."}
{"sequence": "Elisabeth Schüssler Fiorenza wrote \"Revelation: Vision of a Just World\" from the viewpoint of rhetoric."}
{"sequence": "Accordingly, Revelation's meaning is partially determined by the way John goes about saying things, partially by the context in which readers receive the message and partially by its appeal to something beyond logic."}
{"sequence": "Professor Schüssler Fiorenza believes that Revelation has particular relevance today as a liberating message to disadvantaged groups."}
{"sequence": "John's book is a vision of a just world, not a vengeful threat of world-destruction."}
{"sequence": "Her view that Revelation's message is not gender-based has caused dissent."}
{"sequence": "She says we are to look behind the symbols rather than make a fetish out of them."}
{"sequence": "In contrast, Tina Pippin states that John writes \"horror literature\" and \"the misogyny which underlies the narrative is extreme.\""}
{"sequence": "D. H. Lawrence took an opposing, pessimistic view of Revelation in the final book he wrote, \"Apocalypse\"."}
{"sequence": "He saw the language which Revelation used as being bleak and destructive; a 'death-product'."}
{"sequence": "Instead, he wanted to champion a public-spirited individualism (which he identified with the historical Jesus supplemented by an ill-defined cosmic consciousness) against its two natural enemies."}
{"sequence": "One of these he called \"the sovereignty of the intellect\" which he saw in a technology-based totalitarian society."}
{"sequence": "The other enemy he styled \"vulgarity\" and that was what he found in Revelation. \""}
{"sequence": "It is very nice if you are poor and not humble ... to bring your enemies down to utter destruction, while you yourself rise up to grandeur."}
{"sequence": "And nowhere does this happen so splendiferously than in Revelation.\""}
{"sequence": "His specific aesthetic objections to Revelation were that its imagery was unnatural and that phrases like \"the wrath of the Lamb\" were \"ridiculous.\""}
{"sequence": "He saw Revelation as comprising two discordant halves."}
{"sequence": "In the first, there was a scheme of cosmic renewal in \"great Chaldean sky-spaces\", which he quite liked."}
{"sequence": "After that, Lawrence thought, the book became preoccupied with the birth of the baby messiah and \"flamboyant hate and simple lust ... for the end of the world.\""}
{"sequence": "Lawrence coined the term \"Patmossers\" to describe those Christians who could only be happy in paradise if they knew their enemies were suffering in hell."}
{"sequence": "Modern biblical scholarship attempts to understand Revelation in its 1st-century historical context within the genre of Jewish and Christian apocalyptic literature."}
{"sequence": "This approach considers the text as an address to seven historical communities in Asia Minor."}
{"sequence": "Under this interpretation, assertions that \"the time is near\" are to be taken literally by those communities."}
{"sequence": "Consequently, the work is viewed as a warning to not conform to contemporary Greco-Roman society which John \"unveils\" as beastly, demonic, and subject to divine judgment."}
{"sequence": "New Testament narrative criticism also places Revelation in its first century historical context but approaches the book from a literary perspective."}
{"sequence": "For example, narrative critics examine characters and characterization, literary devices, settings, plot, themes, point of view, implied reader, implied author, and other constitutive features of narratives in their analysis of the book."}
{"sequence": "Although the acceptance of Revelation into the canon has, from the beginning, been controversial, it has been essentially similar to the career of other texts."}
{"sequence": "The eventual exclusion of other contemporary apocalyptic literature from the canon may throw light on the unfolding historical processes of what was officially considered orthodox, what was heterodox, and what was even heretical."}
{"sequence": "Interpretation of meanings and imagery are anchored in what the historical author intended and what his contemporary audience inferred; a message to Christians not to assimilate into the Roman imperial culture was John's central message."}
{"sequence": "Thus, his letter (written in the apocalyptic genre) is pastoral in nature (its purpose is offering hope to the downtrodden), and the symbolism of Revelation is to be understood entirely within its historical, literary, and social context."}
{"sequence": "Critics study the conventions of apocalyptic literature and events of the 1st century to make sense of what the author may have intended."}
{"sequence": "Scholar Barbara Whitlock pointed out a similarity between the consistent destruction of thirds depicted in the Book of Revelation (a third of mankind by plagues of fire, smoke, and brimstone, a third of the trees and green grass, a third of the sea creatures and a third of the ships at sea, etc.)"}
{"sequence": "and the Iranian mythology evil character Zahhak or Dahāg, depicted in the Avesta, the earliest religious texts of Zoroastrianism."}
{"sequence": "Dahāg is mentioned as wreaking much evil in the world until at last chained up and imprisoned on the mythical Mt. Damāvand."}
{"sequence": "The Middle Persian sources prophesy that at the end of the world, Dahāg will at last burst his bonds and ravage the world, consuming one in three humans and livestock, until the ancient hero Kirsāsp returns to life to kill Dahāg."}
{"sequence": "Whitlock wrote: \"Zoroastrianism, the state religion of the Roman Empire's main rival, was part of the intellectual millieu in which Christianity came into being, just as were Judaism, the Greek-Roman religion, and the worship of Isis and Mithras."}
{"sequence": "A Zoroastrian influence is completely plausible\"."}
{"sequence": "Much of Revelation employs ancient sources, primarily but not exclusively from the Old Testament."}
{"sequence": "For example, Howard-Brook and Gwyther regard the Book of Enoch (1 Enoch) as an equally significant but contextually different source. \""}
{"sequence": "Enoch's journey has no close parallel in the Hebrew scriptures.\""}
{"sequence": "Revelation, in one section, forms an inverted parallel (chiasmus) with the book of Enoch in which 1 En 100:1–3 has a river of blood deep enough to submerge a chariot and in Rev 14:20 has a river of blood up to the horse's bridle."}
{"sequence": "There is an angel ascending in both accounts (1 En 100:4; Rev 14:14–19) and both accounts have three messages (1 En 100:7–9; Rev 14:6–12)."}
{"sequence": "Academics showed little interest in this topic until recently."}
{"sequence": "This was not, however, the case with popular writers from non-conforming backgrounds, who interspersed the text of Revelation with the prophecy they thought was being promised."}
{"sequence": "For example, an anonymous Scottish commentary of 1871 prefaces Revelation 4 with the Little Apocalypse of Mark 13, places Malachi 4:5 (\"Behold I will send you Elijah the prophet before the coming of the great and dreadful day of the Lord\") within Revelation 11 and writes Revelation 12:7 side by side with the role of \"the Satan\" in the Book of Job."}
{"sequence": "The message is that everything in Revelation will happen in its previously appointed time."}
{"sequence": "Steve Moyise uses the index of the United Bible Societies' Greek New Testament to show that \"Revelation contains more Old Testament allusions than any other New Testament book, but it does not record a single quotation.\""}
{"sequence": "Perhaps significantly, Revelation chooses different sources than other New Testament books."}
{"sequence": "Revelation concentrates on Isaiah, Psalms, and Ezekiel, while neglecting, comparatively speaking, the books of the Pentateuch that are the dominant sources for other New Testament writers."}
{"sequence": "Methodological objections have been made to this course as each allusion may not have an equal significance."}
{"sequence": "To counter this, G. K. Beale sought to develop a system that distinguished 'clear', 'probable', and 'possible' allusions."}
{"sequence": "A clear allusion is one with almost the same wording as its source, the same general meaning, and which could not reasonably have been drawn from elsewhere."}
{"sequence": "A probable allusion contains an idea which is uniquely traceable to its source."}
{"sequence": "Possible allusions are described as mere echoes of their putative sources."}
{"sequence": "Yet, with Revelation, the problems might be judged more fundamental."}
{"sequence": "The author seems to be using his sources in a completely different way to the originals."}
{"sequence": "For example, he borrows the 'new temple' imagery of Ezekiel 40–48 but uses it to describe a New Jerusalem which, quite pointedly, no longer needs a temple because it is God's dwelling."}
{"sequence": "Ian Boxall writes that Revelation \"is no montage of biblical quotations (that is not John's way) but a wealth of allusions and evocations rewoven into something new and creative.\""}
{"sequence": "In trying to identify this \"something new\", Boxall argues that Ezekiel provides the 'backbone' for Revelation."}
{"sequence": "He sets out a comparative table listing the chapters of Revelation in sequence and linking most of them to the structurally corresponding chapter in Ezekiel."}
{"sequence": "The interesting point is that the order is not the same."}
{"sequence": "John, on this theory, rearranges Ezekiel to suit his own purposes."}
{"sequence": "Some commentators argue that it is these purposes – and not the structure – that really matter."}
{"sequence": "G. K. Beale believes that, however much John makes use of Ezekiel, his ultimate purpose is to present Revelation as a fulfillment of Daniel 7."}
{"sequence": "Richard Bauckham has argued that John presents an early view of the Trinity through his descriptions of the visions and his identifying Jesus and the Holy Spirit with YHWH."}
{"sequence": "Brandon Smith has expanded on both of their proposals while proposing a \"trinitarian reading\" of Revelation, arguing that John uses Old Testament language and allusions from various sources to describe a multiplicity of persons in YHWH without sacrificing monotheism, which would later be codified in the trinitarian doctrine of Nicene Christianity."}
{"sequence": "One theory, Revelation Draft Hypothesis, sees the book of Revelation constructed by forming parallels with several texts in the Old Testament such as Ezekiel, Isaiah, Zechariah, Deuteronomy, Joshua, Exodus, and Daniel."}
{"sequence": "For example, Ezekiel's encounter with God is in reverse order as John's encounter with God (Ezek 1:5–28; Rev 4:2–7) note both accounts have beings with faces of a lion, ox or calf, man, and eagle (Ezek 1:10; Rev 4:7), both accounts have an expanse before the throne (Ezek 1:22; Rev 4:6)."}
{"sequence": "The chariot's horses in Zechariah's are the same colors as the four horses in Revelation (Zech 6:1–8; Rev 6:1–8)."}
{"sequence": "The nesting of the seven marches around Jericho by Joshua is reenacted by Jesus nesting the seven trumpets within the seventh seal (Josh 6:8–10; Rev 6:1–17; 8:1–9:21; 11:15–19)."}
{"sequence": "The description of the beast in Revelation is taken directly out of Daniel (see Dan 7:2–8; Rev 13:1–7)."}
{"sequence": "The method that John used allowed him to use the Hebrew Scriptures as the source and also use basic techniques of parallel formation, thereby alluding to the Hebrew Scriptures."}
{"sequence": "In order of appearance:"}
{"sequence": "It concludes the Deuteronomistic history, a history of Israel also comprising the books of Joshua and Judges and the Book of Samuel, which biblical commentators believe was written to provide a theological explanation for the destruction of the Kingdom of Judah by Babylon in c. 586 BCE and a foundation for a return from exile."}
{"sequence": "Scholars tend to treat the books as made up of a first edition from the late 7th century BCE and a second and final edition from the mid 6th century BCE."}
{"sequence": "The Jerusalem Bible divides the two books of Kings into eight sections: In David's old age, Adonijah proclaims himself his successor but Solomon's supporters arrange for David to proclaim Solomon as his successor, and so he comes to the throne after David's death."}
{"sequence": "At the beginning of his reign he assumes God's promises to David and brings splendour to Israel and peace and prosperity to his people."}
{"sequence": "The centrepiece of Solomon's reign is the building of the First Temple: the claim that this took place 480 years after the Exodus from Egypt marks it as a key event in Israel's history."}
{"sequence": "At the end, however, he follows other gods and oppresses Israel."}
{"sequence": "As a consequence of Solomon's failure to stamp out the worship of gods other than Yahweh, the kingdom of David is split in two in the reign of his own son Rehoboam, who becomes the first to reign over the kingdom of Judah."}
{"sequence": "The kings who follow Rehoboam in Jerusalem continue the royal line of David (i.e., they inherit the promise to David); in the north, however, dynasties follow each other in rapid succession, and the kings are uniformly bad (meaning that they fail to follow Yahweh alone)."}
{"sequence": "At length God brings the Assyrians to destroy the northern kingdom, leaving Judah as the sole custodian of the promise."}
{"sequence": "Hezekiah, the 14th king of Judah, does \"what [is] right in the Lord's sight just as his ancestor David had done\" and institutes a far reaching religious reform, centralising sacrifice at the temple at Jerusalem and destroying the images of other gods."}
{"sequence": "Yahweh saves Jerusalem and the kingdom from an invasion by Assyria."}
{"sequence": "But Manasseh, the next king, reverses the reforms, and God announces that he will destroy Jerusalem because of this apostasy by the king."}
{"sequence": "Manasseh's righteous grandson Josiah reinstitutes the reforms of Hezekiah, but it is too late: God, speaking through the prophetess Huldah, affirms that Jerusalem is to be destroyed after the death of Josiah."}
{"sequence": "In the final chapters, God brings the Neo-Babylonian Empire of King Nebuchadnezzar against Jerusalem; Yahweh withholds aid from his people, Jerusalem is razed and the Temple destroyed, and the priests, prophets and royal court are led into captivity."}
{"sequence": "The final verses record how Jehoiachin, the last king, is set free and given honour by the king of Babylon."}
{"sequence": "In the Hebrew Bible (the Bible used by Jews), First and Second Kings are a single book, as are the First and Second Books of Samuel."}
{"sequence": "When this was translated into Greek in the last few centuries BCE, Samuel was joined with Kings in a four-part work called the Book of Kingdoms."}
{"sequence": "Orthodox Christians continue to use the Greek translation (the Septuagint), but when a Latin translation (called the Vulgate) was made for the Western church, Kingdoms was first retitled the Book of Kings, parts One to Four, and eventually both Samuel and Kings were separated into two books each."}
{"sequence": "Thus, the books now commonly known as 1Samuel and 2Samuel are known in the Vulgate as 1Kings and 2Kings (in imitation of the Septuagint)."}
{"sequence": "What are now commonly known as 1Kings and 2Kings would be 3Kings and 4Kings in old Bibles before the year 1516, such as in the Vulgate and the Septuagint."}
{"sequence": "The division we know today, used by Protestant Bibles and adopted by Catholics, came into use in 1517."}
{"sequence": "Some Bibles still preserve the old denomination, for example, the Douay Rheims Bible."}
{"sequence": "According to Jewish tradition the author of Kings was Jeremiah, who would have been alive during the fall of Jerusalem in 586 BCE."}
{"sequence": "The most common view today accepts Martin Noth's thesis that Kings concludes a unified series of books which reflect the language and theology of the Book of Deuteronomy, and which biblical scholars therefore call the Deuteronomistic history."}
{"sequence": "Noth argued that the History was the work of a single individual living in the 6th century BCE, but scholars today tend to treat it as made up of at least two layers, a first edition from the time of Josiah (late 7th century BCE), promoting Josiah's religious reforms and the need for repentance, and (2) a second and final edition from the mid 6th century BCE."}
{"sequence": "Further levels of editing have also been proposed, including: a late 8th century BCE edition pointing to Hezekiah of Judah as the model for kingship; an earlier 8th century BCE version with a similar message but identifying Jehu of Israel as the ideal king; and an even earlier version promoting the House of David as the key to national well-being."}
{"sequence": "The editors/authors of the Deuteronomistic history cite a number of sources, including (for example) a \"Book of the Acts of Solomon\" and, frequently, the \"Annals of the Kings of Judah\" and a separate book, \"Chronicles of the Kings of Israel\"."}
{"sequence": "The \"Deuteronomic\" perspective (that of the book of Deuteronomy) is particularly evident in prayers and speeches spoken by key figures at major transition points: Solomon's speech at the dedication of the Temple is a key example."}
{"sequence": "The sources have been heavily edited to meet the Deuteronomistic agenda, but in the broadest sense they appear to have been: Three of the Dead Sea Scrolls feature parts of Kings: 5QKgs, found in Qumran Cave 5, contains parts of 1 Kings 1; 6QpapKgs, found in Qumran Cave 6, contains 94 fragments from all over the two books; and 4QKgs, found in Qumran Cave 4, contains parts of 1 Kings 7–8."}
{"sequence": "The earliest complete surviving copy of the book(s) of Kings is in the Aleppo Codex (10th century CE)."}
{"sequence": "Kings is \"history-like\" rather than history in the modern sense, mixing legends, folktales, miracle stories and \"fictional constructions\" in with the annals, and its primary explanation for all that happens is God's offended sense of what is right; it is therefore more fruitful to read it as theological literature in the form of history."}
{"sequence": "The theological bias is seen in the way it judges each king of Israel on the basis of whether he recognises the authority of the Temple in Jerusalem (none do, and therefore all are \"evil\"), and each king of Judah on the basis of whether he destroys the \"high places\" (rivals to the Temple in Jerusalem); it gives only passing mention to important and successful kings like Omri and Jeroboam II and totally ignores one of the most significant events in ancient Israel's history, the battle of Qarqar."}
{"sequence": "The major themes of Kings are God's promise, the recurrent apostasy of the kings, and the judgement this brings on Israel: Another and related theme is that of prophecy."}
{"sequence": "The main point of the prophetic stories is that God's prophecies are always fulfilled, so that any not yet fulfilled will be so in the future."}
{"sequence": "The implication, the release of Jehoiachin and his restoration to a place of honour in Babylon in the closing scenes of the book, is that the promise of an eternal Davidic dynasty is still in effect, and that the Davidic line will be restored."}
{"sequence": "The standard Hebrew text of Kings presents an impossible chronology."}
{"sequence": "To take just a single example, Omri's accession to the throne of Israel in the 31st year of Asa of Judah (1 Kings 16:23) cannot follow the death of his predecessor Zimri in the 27th year of Asa (1 Kings 16:15)."}
{"sequence": "The Greek text corrects the impossibilities but does not seem to represent an earlier version."}
{"sequence": "A large number of scholars have claimed to solve the difficulties, but the results differ, sometimes widely, and none has achieved consensus status."}
{"sequence": "The book 2 Chronicles covers much the same time-period as the books of Kings, but it ignores the northern Kingdom of Israel almost completely, David is given a major role in planning the Temple, Hezekiah is given a much more far-reaching program of reform, and Manasseh of Judah is given an opportunity to repent of his sins, apparently to account for his long reign."}
{"sequence": "It is usually assumed that the author of Chronicles used Kings as a source and emphasised different areas as he would have liked it to have been interpreted."}
{"sequence": "The book, written in Hebrew in the 6th–4th centuries BC, tells of a Moabite woman, Ruth, accepting Yahweh, the God of the Israelites, as her God and the Israelite people as her own."}
{"sequence": "In –17, Ruth tells Naomi, her Israelite mother-in-law, \"Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay."}
{"sequence": "Your people will be my people and your God my God."}
{"sequence": "Where you die I will die, and there I will be buried."}
{"sequence": "May the Lord deal with me, be it ever so severely, if even death separates you and me.\""}
{"sequence": "The book is held in esteem by Jews who fall under the category of Jews-by-choice, as is evidenced by the considerable presence of Boaz in rabbinic literature."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Ruth also functions liturgically, as it is read during the Jewish holiday of Shavuot (\"Weeks\")."}
{"sequence": "The book is structured in four chapters: Act 1: Prologue and Problem: Death and Emptiness (1:1–22) Act 2: Ruth Meets Boaz, Naomi's Relative, on the Harvest Field (2:1–23) Act 3: Naomi Sends Ruth to Boaz on the Threshing Floor (3:1–18) Act 4: Resolution and Epilogue: Life and Fullness (4:1–22) Genealogical appendix (4:18–22) During the time of the judges, an Israelite family from Bethlehem – Elimelech, his wife Naomi, and their sons Mahlon and Chilion – emigrated to the nearby country of Moab."}
{"sequence": "Elimelech died, and the sons married two Moabite women: Mahlon married Ruth and Chilion married Orpah."}
{"sequence": "After about ten years, the two sons of Naomi also died in Moab (1:4)."}
{"sequence": "Naomi decided to return to Bethlehem."}
{"sequence": "She told her daughters-in-law to return to their own mothers and remarry."}
{"sequence": "Orpah reluctantly left; however, Ruth said, \"Do not urge me to leave you, to turn back and not follow you."}
{"sequence": "For wherever you go, I will go; wherever you lodge, I will lodge; your people shall be my people, and your God my God."}
{"sequence": "Where you die, I will die, and there I will be buried."}
{"sequence": "Thus and more may the Lord do to me if anything but death parts me from you.\" ("}
{"sequence": "Ruth 1:16–17 NJPS)."}
{"sequence": "The two women returned to Bethlehem at the beginning of the barley harvest, and in order to support her mother-in-law and herself, Ruth went to the fields to glean."}
{"sequence": "As it happened, the field she went to belonged to a man named Boaz, who was kind to her because he had heard of her loyalty to her mother-in-law."}
{"sequence": "Ruth told Naomi of Boaz's kindness, and she gleaned in his field through the remainder of barley and wheat harvest."}
{"sequence": "Boaz was a close relative of Naomi's husband's family."}
{"sequence": "He was therefore obliged by the levirate law to marry Mahlon's widow, Ruth, in order to carry on his family's inheritance."}
{"sequence": "Naomi sent Ruth to the threshing floor at night and told her to go where he slept, and \"uncover his feet and lie down."}
{"sequence": "He will tell you what you are to do.\" ("}
{"sequence": "Ruth did so."}
{"sequence": "Boaz asked her who she was, and she replied: \"I am your handmaid Ruth."}
{"sequence": "Spread your robe over your handmaid, for you are a redeeming kinsman\" (3:9 NJPS)."}
{"sequence": "Boaz blessed her and agreed to do all that is required, and he noted that, \"all the elders of my town know what a fine woman you are\" (3:11 NJPS)."}
{"sequence": "He then acknowledged that he was a close relative, but that there was one who was closer, and she remained in submission at his feet until she returned into the city in the morning."}
{"sequence": "Early that day, Boaz went to the city gate to meet with the other male relative before the town elders."}
{"sequence": "The relative is not named: Boaz addresses him as \"ploni almoni\", literally \"so and so\"."}
{"sequence": "The unnamed relative is unwilling to jeopardize the inheritance of his own estate by marrying Ruth, and so relinquished his right of redemption, thus allowing Boaz to marry Ruth."}
{"sequence": "They transferred the property and redeemed it, ratified by the nearer kinsman taking off his shoe and handing it over to Boaz."}
{"sequence": "Ruth 4:7 notes for later generations that: Boaz and Ruth were then married and have a son."}
{"sequence": "The women of the city celebrate Naomi's joy, for Naomi found a redeemer for her family name, and Naomi takes the child and places it in her bosom."}
{"sequence": "The child is named Obed, who we discover is \"the father of Jesse, the father of David\" (Ruth 4:13–17), that is, the grandfather of King David."}
{"sequence": "The book concludes with an appendix which traces the Davidic genealogy all the way back from Perez, \"whom Tamar bore to Judah\", through to Obed, down to David."}
{"sequence": "The book does not name its author."}
{"sequence": "It is traditionally ascribed to the prophet Samuel, but Ruth's identity as a non-Israelite and the stress on the need for an inclusive attitude towards foreigners suggests an origin in the fifth century BC, when intermarriage had become controversial (as seen in Ezra 9:1 and Nehemiah 13:1)."}
{"sequence": "A substantial number of scholars therefore date it to the Persian period (6th–4th centuries BC)."}
{"sequence": "The genealogy that concludes the book is believed to be a post-exilic Priestly addition, as it adds nothing to the plot; nevertheless, it is carefully crafted and integrates the book into the history of Israel running from Genesis to Kings."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Ruth illustrates the difficulty of trying to use laws given in books such as Deuteronomy as evidence of actual practice."}
{"sequence": "Naomi plans to provide security for herself and Ruth by arranging a levirate marriage with Boaz."}
{"sequence": "She instructs Ruth to uncover Boaz's feet after he has gone to sleep and lie down."}
{"sequence": "When Boaz wakes up, surprised to see a woman at his feet, Ruth explains she wants him to redeem (and thus marry) her."}
{"sequence": "Many modern commentators see sexual allusions in this part of the story, with 'feet' as a euphemism for genitals."}
{"sequence": "Since there was no heir to inherit Elimelech's land, custom required a close relative (usually the dead man's brother) to marry the widow of the deceased in order to continue his family line (Deuteronomy 25:5–10)."}
{"sequence": "This relative was called the go'el, the \"kinsman-redeemer\"."}
{"sequence": "As Boaz is not Elimelech's brother, nor is Ruth his widow, scholars refer to the arrangement here as \"Levirate-like\"."}
{"sequence": "A complication arises in the story: another man is a closer relative to Elimelech than Boaz and has first claim on Ruth."}
{"sequence": "It is resolved through the custom that required land to stay in the family: a family could mortgage land to ward off poverty, but the law required a kinsman to purchase it back into the family (Leviticus 25:25ff)."}
{"sequence": "Boaz meets the near kinsman at the city gate (the place where contracts are settled); the kinsman first says he will purchase Elimelech's (now Naomi's) land, but, upon hearing he must also take Ruth as his wife, withdraws his offer."}
{"sequence": "Boaz thus becomes Ruth and Naomi's \"kinsman-redeemer.\""}
{"sequence": "The book can be read as a political parable relating to issues around the time of Ezra and Nehemiah (the 4th century BCE)."}
{"sequence": "The realistic nature of the story is established from the start through the names of the participants: the husband and father is Elimelech, meaning \"My God is King\", and his wife is Naomi, \"Pleasing\", but after the deaths of her sons Mahlon, \"Sickness\", and Chilion, \"Wasting\", she asks to be called Mara, \"Bitter\"."}
{"sequence": "Despite this, Ruth the Moabite married a Judahite and even after his death still regarded herself a member of his family; she then married another Judahite and bore him a son who became an ancestor of David."}
{"sequence": "Concerning this, the Mishnah says that only male Moabites are banned from the congregation."}
{"sequence": "Unlike the story of Ezra–Nehemiah, where marriages between Jewish men and non-Jewish women were broken up, Ruth teaches that foreigners who convert to Judaism can become good Jews, foreign wives can become exemplary followers of Jewish law, and there is no reason to exclude them or their offspring from the community."}
{"sequence": "Scholars have increasingly explored Ruth in ways which allow it to address contemporary issues."}
{"sequence": "Feminists, for example, have recast the story as one of the dignity of labour and female self-sufficiency, and a model for lesbian relations, while others have seen in it a celebration of the relationship between strong and resourceful women."}
{"sequence": "Others have criticised it for its underlying, and potentially exploitative, acceptance of a system of patriarchy in which a woman's worth can only be measured through marriage and child-bearing."}
{"sequence": "Others again have seen it as a book that champions outcast and oppressed peoples."}
{"sequence": "Book of Esther The Book of Esther (hebrew: מְגִלַּת אֶסְתֵּר, \"Megillat Esther\"), also known in Hebrew as \"the Scroll\" (\"Megillah\"), is a book in the third section (\"Ketuvim\", \"Writings\") of the Jewish \"Tanakh\" (the Hebrew Bible) and in the Christian Old Testament."}
{"sequence": "It is one of the five Scrolls (\"Megillot\") in the Hebrew Bible."}
{"sequence": "It relates the story of a Hebrew woman in Persia, born as Hadassah but known as Esther, who becomes queen of Persia and thwarts a genocide of her people."}
{"sequence": "The story forms the core of the Jewish festival of Purim, during which it is read aloud twice: once in the evening and again the following morning."}
{"sequence": "The books of Esther and Song of Songs are the only books in the Hebrew Bible that do not mention God."}
{"sequence": "The biblical Book of Esther is set in the Persian capital of Susa (\"Shushan\") in the third year of the reign of the Persian king Ahasuerus."}
{"sequence": "The name \"Ahasuerus\" is equivalent to \"Xerxes\" (both deriving from the Persian \"Khshayārsha\"), and Ahasuerus is usually identified in modern sources as Xerxes I, who ruled between 486 and 465 BC, as it is to this monarch that the events described in Esther are thought to fit the most closely."}
{"sequence": "Assuming that Ahasuerus is indeed Xerxes I, the events described in Esther began around the years 483–82 BC, and concluded in March 473 BC."}
{"sequence": "Classical sources such as Josephus, the Jewish commentary \"Esther Rabbah\" and the Christian theologian Bar-Hebraeus, as well as the Greek Septuagint translation of Esther, instead identify Ahasuerus as either Artaxerxes I (reigned 465 to 424 BC) or Artaxerxes II (reigned 404 to 358 BC)."}
{"sequence": "On his accession, however, Artaxerxes II lost Egypt to pharaoh Amyrtaeus, after which it was no longer part of the Persian empire."}
{"sequence": "In his \"Historia Scholastica\" Petrus Comestor identified Ahasuerus (Esther 1:1) as Artaxerxes III (358–38 BC) who reconquered Egypt."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Esther consists of an introduction (or exposition) in chapters 1 and 2; the main action (complication and resolution) in chapters 3 to 9:19; and a conclusion in 9:20–10:3."}
{"sequence": "The plot is structured around banquets (\"mishteh\"), a word that occurs twenty times in Esther and only 24 times in the rest of the Hebrew bible."}
{"sequence": "This is appropriate given that Esther describes the origin of a Jewish feast, the feast of Purim, but Purim itself is not the subject and no individual feast in the book is commemorated by Purim."}
{"sequence": "The book's theme, rather, is the reversal of destiny through a sudden and unexpected turn of events: the Jews seem destined to be destroyed, but instead are saved."}
{"sequence": "In literary criticism such a reversal is termed \"peripety\", and while on one level its use in Esther is simply a literary or aesthetic device, on another it is structural to the author's theme, suggesting that the power of God is at work behind human events."}
{"sequence": "King Ahasuerus, ruler of the Persian Empire, holds a lavish 180-day banquet, initially for his court and dignitaries and afterwards a seven-day banquet for all inhabitants of the capital city, Shushan (Esther 1:1–9)."}
{"sequence": "On the seventh day of the latter banquet, Ahasuerus orders the queen, Vashti, to display her beauty before the guests by coming before them wearing her crown (1:10–11)."}
{"sequence": "She refuses, infuriating Ahasuerus, who on the advice of his counselors removes her from her position as an example to other women who might be emboldened to disobey their husbands (1:12–19)."}
{"sequence": "A decree follows that \"every man should bear rule in his own house\" (1:20–22)."}
{"sequence": "Ahasuerus then makes arrangements to choose a new queen from a selection of beautiful young women from throughout the empire (2:1–4)."}
{"sequence": "Among these women is a Jewish orphan named Esther, who was raised by her cousin or uncle, Mordecai (2:5–7)."}
{"sequence": "She finds favour in the King's eyes, and is crowned his new queen, but does not reveal her Jewish heritage (2:8–20)."}
{"sequence": "Shortly afterwards, Mordecai discovers a plot by two courtiers, Bigthan and Teresh, to assassinate Ahasuerus."}
{"sequence": "The conspirators are apprehended and hanged, and Mordecai's service to the King is recorded (2:21–23)."}
{"sequence": "Ahasuerus appoints Haman as his viceroy (3:1)."}
{"sequence": "Mordecai, who sits at the palace gates, falls into Haman's disfavour, as he refuses to bow down to him (3:2–5)."}
{"sequence": "Haman discovers that Mordecai refused to bow on account of his Jewishness, and in revenge plots to kill not just Mordecai, but all the Jews in the empire (3:6)."}
{"sequence": "He obtains Ahasuerus' permission to execute this plan, against payment of ten thousand talents of silver, and casts lots (\"purim\") to choose the date on which to do this the thirteenth of the month of Adar (3:7–12)."}
{"sequence": "A royal decree is issued throughout the kingdom to slay all Jews on that date. ("}
{"sequence": "When Mordecai discovers the plan, he goes into mourning and implores Esther to intercede with the King (4:1–5)."}
{"sequence": "But she is afraid to present herself to the King unsummoned, an offense punishable by death (4:6–12)."}
{"sequence": "Instead, she directs Mordecai to have all Jews fast for three days for her, and vows to fast as well (4:15–16.)."}
{"sequence": "On the third day she goes to Ahasuerus, who stretches out his sceptre to her to indicate that she is not to be punished (5:1–2)."}
{"sequence": "She invites him to a feast in the company of Haman (5:3–5)."}
{"sequence": "During the feast, she asks them to attend a further feast the next evening (5:6–8)."}
{"sequence": "Meanwhile, Haman is again offended by Mordecai and, at his wife's suggestion, has a gallows built to hang him (5:9–14)."}
{"sequence": "That night, Ahasuerus cannot sleep, and orders the court records be read to him (6:1)."}
{"sequence": "He is reminded that Mordecai interceded in the previous plot against his life, and discovers that Mordecai never received any recognition (6:2–3)."}
{"sequence": "Just then, Haman appears to request the King's permission to hang Mordecai, but before he can make this request, Ahasuerus asks Haman what should be done for the man that the King wishes to honor (6:4–6)."}
{"sequence": "Assuming that the King is referring to Haman himself, Haman suggests that the man be dressed in the King's royal robes, and crown and led around on the King's royal horse, while a herald calls: \"See how the King honours a man he wishes to reward!\" ("}
{"sequence": "To his surprise and horror, the King instructs Haman to do so to Mordecai (6:10–11)."}
{"sequence": "Immediately after, Ahasuerus and Haman attend Esther's second banquet."}
{"sequence": "The King promises to grant her any request, and she reveals that she is Jewish and that Haman is planning to exterminate her people, including her (7:1–6)."}
{"sequence": "Overcome by rage, Ahasuerus leaves the room; meanwhile Haman stays behind and begs Esther for his life, falling upon her in desperation (7:7)."}
{"sequence": "The King returns in at this very moment and thinks Haman is assaulting the queen; this makes him angrier and he orders Haman hanged on the very gallows that Haman had prepared for Mordecai (7:8–10)."}
{"sequence": "Unable to annul a formal royal decree, the King instead adds to it, permitting the Jews to join together and destroy any and all of those seeking to kill them (8:1–14)."}
{"sequence": "On 13 Adar, Haman's ten sons and 500 other men are killed in Shushan (9:1–12)."}
{"sequence": "Upon hearing of this Esther requests it be repeated the next day, whereupon 300 more men are killed (9:13–15)."}
{"sequence": "Over 75,000 people are slaughtered by the Jews, who are careful to take no plunder (9:16–17)."}
{"sequence": "Mordecai and Esther send letters throughout the provinces instituting an annual commemoration of the Jewish people's redemption, in a holiday called Purim (lots) (9:20–28)."}
{"sequence": "Ahasuerus remains very powerful and continues his reign, with Mordecai assuming a prominent position in his court (10:1–3)."}
{"sequence": "The \"Megillat Esther\" (Book of Esther) became the last of the 24 books of the Tanakh to be canonized by the Sages of the Great Assembly."}
{"sequence": "According to the Talmud, it was a redaction by the Great Assembly of an original text by Mordecai."}
{"sequence": "It is usually dated to the 4th century BC."}
{"sequence": "Shemaryahu Talmon, however, suggests that \"the traditional setting of the book in the days of Xerxes I cannot be wide off the mark.\""}
{"sequence": "The Greek book of Esther, included in the Septuagint, is a retelling of the events of the Hebrew Book of Esther rather than a translation and records additional traditions which do not appear in the traditional Hebrew version, in particular the identification of Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes and details of various letters."}
{"sequence": "It is dated around the late 2nd to early 1st century BC."}
{"sequence": "The Coptic and Ethiopic versions of Esther are translations of the Greek rather than the Hebrew Esther."}
{"sequence": "A Latin version of Esther was produced by Jerome for the Vulgate."}
{"sequence": "It translates the Hebrew Esther but interpolates translations of the Greek Esther where the latter provides additional material."}
{"sequence": "Several Aramaic targums of Esther were produced in the Middle Ages of which two survive – the \"Targum Rishon\" (\"First Targum\") and \"Targum Sheni\" (\"Second Targum\") dated c. 500–1000 AD."}
{"sequence": "These were not targums (\"translations\") in the true sense but like the Greek Esther are retellings of events and include additional legends relating to Purim."}
{"sequence": "There is also a 16th-century recension of the \"Targum Rishon\", sometimes counted as \"Targum Shelishi\" (\"Third Targum\")."}
{"sequence": "The apparent historical difficulties, the internal inconsistencies, the pronounced symmetry of themes and events, the plenitude of quoted dialogue, and the gross exaggeration in the reporting of numbers (involving time, money, and people) all point to Esther as a work of fiction, its vivid characters (except for Xerxes) being the product of the author's creative imagination."}
{"sequence": "There is no reference to known historical events in the story; a general consensus, though this consensus has been challenged, has maintained that the narrative of \"Esther\" was invented in order to provide an aetiology for Purim, and the name Ahasuerus is usually understood to refer to a fictionalized Xerxes I, who ruled the Achaemenid Empire between 486 and 465 BCE."}
{"sequence": "According to some sources, it is a historical novella, written to explain the origin of the Jewish holiday of Purim."}
{"sequence": "As noted by biblical scholar Michael D. Coogan, the book contains specific details regarding certain subject matter (for example, Persian rule) which are historically inaccurate."}
{"sequence": "For example, Coogan discusses an apparent inaccuracy regarding the age of Esther's cousin (or, according to others, uncle) Mordecai."}
{"sequence": "In Esther 2:5–6, either Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish is identified as having been exiled from Jerusalem to Babylon by King Nebuchadnezzar II in 597 BC: \"Mordecai son of Jair, the son of Shimei, the son of Kish, who had been carried into exile from Jerusalem by Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon, among those taken captive with Jeconiah king of Judah\"."}
{"sequence": "If this refers to Mordecai, he would have had to live over a century to have witnessed the events described in the Book of Esther."}
{"sequence": "However, the verse may be read as referring not to Mordecai's exile to Babylon, but to his great-grandfather Kish's exile."}
{"sequence": "In her article \"The Book of Esther and Ancient Storytelling\", biblical scholar Adele Berlin discusses the reasoning behind scholarly concern about the historicity of Esther."}
{"sequence": "Much of this debate relates to the importance of distinguishing history and fiction within biblical texts, as Berlin argues, in order to gain a more accurate understanding of the history of the Israelite people."}
{"sequence": "Berlin quotes a series of scholars who suggest that the author of Esther did not mean for the book to be considered as a historical writing, but intentionally wrote it to be a historical novella."}
{"sequence": "The genre of novellas under which Esther falls was common during both the Persian and Hellenistic periods to which scholars have dated the book of Esther."}
{"sequence": "There are certain elements of the book of Esther that are historically accurate."}
{"sequence": "The story told in the book of Esther takes place during the rule of Ahasuerus, who amongst others has been identified as the 5th-century Persian king Xerxes I (reigned 486–465 BC)."}
{"sequence": "The author also displays an accurate knowledge of Persian customs and palaces."}
{"sequence": "However, according to Coogan, considerable historical inaccuracies remain throughout the text, supporting the view that the book of Esther is to be read as a historical novella which tells a story describing historical events but is not necessarily historical fact."}
{"sequence": "Edwin M. Yamauchi has questioned the reliability of other historical sources, such as Herodotus, to which Esther has been compared."}
{"sequence": "Yamauchi wrote, \"[Herodotus] was, however, the victim of unreliable informants and was not infallible.\""}
{"sequence": "The reason for questioning the historical accuracy of such ancient writers as Herodotus is that he is one of the primary sources of knowledge for this time period, and it has been frequently assumed that his account may be more accurate than Esther's account."}
{"sequence": "Those arguing in favour of a historical reading of Esther most commonly identify Ahasuerus with Xerxes I (ruled 486–465 BC), although in the past it was often assumed that he was Artaxerxes II (ruled 405–359 BC)."}
{"sequence": "The Hebrew \"Ahasuerus\" (\"ʔaḥašwērōš\") is most likely derived from Persian \"Xšayārša\", the origin of the Greek \"Xerxes\"."}
{"sequence": "The Greek historian Herodotus wrote that Xerxes sought his harem after being defeated in the Greco-Persian Wars."}
{"sequence": "He makes no reference to individual members of the harem except for a domineering Queen consort named Amestris, whose father, Otanes, was one of Xerxes's generals. ("}
{"sequence": "In contrast, the Greek historian Ctesias refers to a similar father-in-law/general figure named Onaphas.)"}
{"sequence": "Amestris has often been identified with Vashti, but this identification is problematic, as Amestris remained a powerful figure well into the reign of her son, Artaxerxes I, whereas Vashti is portrayed as dismissed in the early part of Xerxes's reign."}
{"sequence": "Alternative attempts have been made to identify her with Esther, although Esther is an orphan whose father was a Jew named Abihail."}
{"sequence": "As for the identity of Mordecai, the similar names \"Marduka\" and \"Marduku\" have been found as the name of officials in the Persian court in over thirty texts from the period of Xerxes I and his father Darius I, and may refer to up to four individuals, one of whom might be the model for the biblical Mordecai."}
{"sequence": "The \"Old Greek\" Septuagint version of Esther translates the name Ahasuerus as \"Artaxerxes\", a Greek name derived from the Persian \"Artaxšaϑra\"."}
{"sequence": "Josephus too relates that this was the name by which he was known to the Greeks, and the Midrashic text \"Esther Rabba\" also makes the identification."}
{"sequence": "Bar-Hebraeus identified Ahasuerus explicitly as Artaxerxes II; however, the names are not necessarily equivalent: Hebrew has a form of the name \"Artaxerxes\" distinct from \"Ahasuerus\", and a direct Greek rendering of \"Ahasuerus\" is used by both Josephus and the Septuagint for occurrences of the name outside the Book of Esther."}
{"sequence": "Instead, the Hebrew name Ahasuerus accords with an inscription of the time that notes that Artaxerxes II was named also \"Aršu\", understood as a shortening of \"Aḫšiyaršu\" the Babylonian rendering of the Persian \"Xšayārša\" (Xerxes), through which the Hebrew \"ʔaḥašwērōš\" (Ahasuerus) is derived."}
{"sequence": "Ctesias related that Artaxerxes II was also called \"Arsicas\" which is understood as a similar shortening with the Persian suffix \"-ke\" that is applied to shortened names."}
{"sequence": "Deinon related that Artaxerxes II was also called \"Oarses\" which is also understood to be derived from \"Xšayārša\"."}
{"sequence": "Another view attempts to identify him instead with Artaxerxes I (ruled 465–424 BC), whose Babylonian concubine, Kosmartydene, was the mother of his son Darius II (ruled 424–405 BC)."}
{"sequence": "Jewish tradition relates that Esther was the mother of a King Darius and so some try to identify Ahasuerus with Artaxerxes I and Esther with Kosmartydene."}
{"sequence": "Based on the view that the Ahasuerus of the Book of Tobit is identical with that of the Book of Esther, some have also identified him as Nebuchadnezzar's ally Cyaxares (ruled 625–585 BC)."}
{"sequence": "In certain manuscripts of Tobit, the former is called \"Achiachar\", which, like the Greek \"Cyaxares\", is thought to be derived from Persian \"Huwaxšaϑra\"."}
{"sequence": "Depending on the interpretation of Esther 2:5–6, Mordecai or his great-grandfather Kish was carried away from Jerusalem with Jeconiah by Nebuchadnezzar, in 597 BC."}
{"sequence": "The view that it was Mordecai would be consistent with the identification of Ahasuerus with Cyaxares."}
{"sequence": "Identifications with other Persian monarchs have also been suggested."}
{"sequence": "Jacob Hoschander has argued that evidence of the historicity of Haman and his father Hamedatha is seen in \"Omanus\" and \"Anadatus\" mentioned by Strabo as being honoured with Anahita in the city of Zela."}
{"sequence": "Hoschander argues that these were not deities as Strabo supposed but garbled forms of \"Haman\" and \"Hamedatha\" who were being worshipped as martyrs."}
{"sequence": "The names are indeed unattested in Persian texts as gods, however the Talmud (\"Sanhedrin\" 61b) and Rashi both record a practice of deifying Haman and Josephus speaks of him being worshipped."}
{"sequence": "Attempts have been made to connect both \"Omanus\" and \"Haman\" with the Zoroastrian term Vohu Mana; however this denotes the principle of \"Good Thoughts\" and is not the name of a deity.)"}
{"sequence": "In his \"Historia Scholastica\" Petrus Comestor identified Ahasuerus (Esther 1:1) as Artaxerxes III who reconquered Egypt."}
{"sequence": "In the Book of Esther the Tetragrammaton does not appear, but it is present, in hidden form, in four complex acrostics in Hebrew: the initial or last letters of four consecutive words, either forwards or backwards comprise YHWH."}
{"sequence": "These letters were distinguished in at least three ancient Hebrew manuscripts in red."}
{"sequence": "Christine Hayes contrasts the Book of Esther with apocalyptic writings, the Book of Daniel in particular: both Esther and Daniel depict an existential threat to the Jewish people, but while Daniel commands the Jews to wait faithfully for God to resolve the crisis, in Esther the crisis is resolved entirely through human action and national solidarity."}
{"sequence": "God, in fact, is not mentioned, Esther is portrayed as assimilated to Persian culture, and Jewish identity in the book is an ethnic category rather than a religious one."}
{"sequence": "This contrasts with traditional Jewish commentaries, such as the commentary of the Vilna Gaon, which states \"But in every verse it discusses the great miracle."}
{"sequence": "However, this miracle was in a hidden form, occurring through apparently natural processes, not like the Exodus from Egypt, which openly revealed the might of God.\""}
{"sequence": "This follows the approach of the Talmud, which states that \"(The Book of) Esther is referenced in the Torah in the verse 'And I shall surely hide (in Hebrew, 'haster astir,' related to 'Esther') My Face from them on that day."}
{"sequence": "Although marriages between Jews and Gentiles are not permitted in orthodox Judaism, even in case of Pikuach nefesh, Esther is not regarded as a sinner, because she remained passive, and risked her life to save that of the entire Jewish people."}
{"sequence": "An additional six chapters appear interspersed in Esther in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of the Bible."}
{"sequence": "This was noted by Jerome in compiling the Latin Vulgate."}
{"sequence": "Additionally, the Greek text contains many small changes in the meaning of the main text."}
{"sequence": "Jerome recognized the former as additions not present in the Hebrew Text and placed them at the end of his Latin translation."}
{"sequence": "This placement and numbering system is used in Catholic Bible translations based primarily on the Vulgate, such as the Douay–Rheims Bible and the Knox Bible."}
{"sequence": "In contrast, the 1979 revision of the Vulgate, the Nova Vulgata, incorporates the additions to Esther directly into the narrative itself, as do most modern Catholic English translations based on the original Hebrew and Greek (e.g., Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition, New American Bible, New Revised Standard Version Catholic Edition)."}
{"sequence": "The numbering system for the additions differs with each translation."}
{"sequence": "The Nova Vulgata accounts for the additional verses by numbering them as extensions of the verses immediately following or preceding them (e.g., Esther 11:2–12 in the old Vulgate becomes Esther 1:1a–1k in the Nova Vulgata), while the NAB and its successor, the NABRE, assign letters of the alphabet as chapter headings for the additions (e.g., Esther 11:2–12:6 in the Vulgate becomes Esther A:1–17)."}
{"sequence": "The RSVCE and the NRSVCE place the additional material into the narrative, but retain the chapter and verse numbering of the old Vulgate."}
{"sequence": "These additions include: By the time the Greek version of Esther was written, the foreign power visible on the horizon as a future threat to Judah was the Macedonians of Alexander the Great, who defeated the Persian empire about 150 years after the time of the story of Esther; the Septuagint version noticeably calls Haman a \"Bougaion\" (βουγαῖον) where the Hebrew text describes him as an Agagite."}
{"sequence": "The canonicity of these Greek additions has been a subject of scholarly disagreement practically since their first appearance in the Septuagint Martin Luther, being perhaps the most vocal Reformation-era critic of the work, considered even the original Hebrew version to be of very doubtful value."}
{"sequence": "Luther's complaints against the book carried past the point of scholarly critique and may reflect Luther's antisemitism."}
{"sequence": "The Council of Trent, the summation of the Roman Catholic Counter-Reformation, reconfirmed the entire book, both Hebrew text and Greek additions, as canonical."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Esther is used twice in commonly used sections of the Catholic Lectionary."}
{"sequence": "In both cases, the text used is not only taken from a Greek addition, the readings also are the prayer of Mordecai, and nothing of Esther's own words is ever used."}
{"sequence": "The Eastern Orthodox Church uses the Septuagint version of Esther, as it does for all of the Old Testament."}
{"sequence": "In contrast, the additions are included in the Biblical apocrypha, usually printed in a separate section (if at all) in Protestant bibles."}
{"sequence": "The additions, called \"The rest of the Book of Esther\", are specifically listed in the Thirty-Nine Articles, Article VI, of the Church of England as non-canonical."}
{"sequence": "Rail transport in Great Britain The railway system in Great Britain is the oldest railway system in the world."}
{"sequence": "The first locomotive-hauled public railway opened in 1825, which was followed by an era of rapid expansion."}
{"sequence": "Most of the track is managed by Network Rail, which in 2017 had a network of of standard-gauge lines, of which were electrified."}
{"sequence": "These lines range from single to quadruple track or more."}
{"sequence": "In addition, some cities have separate metro, light rail and tram systems (including the extensive and historic London Underground)."}
{"sequence": "There are also many private railways (some of them narrow-gauge), which are primarily short lines for tourists."}
{"sequence": "The main rail network is connected with that of continental Europe by the Channel Tunnel and High Speed 1 (originally the Channel Tunnel Rail Link), which fully opened in 1994 and 2007 respectively."}
{"sequence": "In 2016, there were 1.718 billion journeys on the National Rail network, making the British network the fifth most used in the world (Great Britain ranks 23rd in world population)."}
{"sequence": "Unlike a number of other countries, rail travel in the United Kingdom has enjoyed a renaissance in recent years, with passenger numbers approaching their highest ever level (see usage figures below)."}
{"sequence": "This has coincided with the privatisation of British Rail, but the cause of this increase is unclear."}
{"sequence": "The growth is partly attributed to a shift away from private motoring due to growing road congestion and increasing petrol prices, but also to the overall increase in travel due to affluence."}
{"sequence": "Passenger journeys in Britain grew by 88% over the period 1997–98 to 2014 as compared to 62% in Germany, 41% in France and 16% in Spain."}
{"sequence": "The United Kingdom is a member of the International Union of Railways (UIC)."}
{"sequence": "The UIC country code for United Kingdom is 70."}
{"sequence": "The UK has the 17th largest railway network in the world; despite many lines having closed in the 20th century, due to the Beeching cuts, it remains one of the densest networks."}
{"sequence": "It is one of the busiest railways in Europe, with 20% more train services than France, 60% more than Italy, and more than Spain, Switzerland, The Netherlands, Portugal and Norway combined, as well as representing more than 20% of all passenger journeys in Europe."}
{"sequence": "The rail industry employs 115,000 people and supports another 250,000 through its supply chain."}
{"sequence": "After the initial period of rapid expansion following the first public railways in the early 19th century, from about 1900 onwards the network suffered from gradual attrition, and more severe rationalisation in the 1950s and 1960s."}
{"sequence": "However, the network has again been growing since the 1980s."}
{"sequence": "The UK was ranked eighth among national European rail systems in the 2017 European Railway Performance Index for intensity of use, quality of service and safety performance."}
{"sequence": "To cope with increasing passenger numbers, there is a large programme of upgrades to the network, including Thameslink, Crossrail, electrification of lines, in-cab signalling, new inter-city trains and a new high-speed line."}
{"sequence": "The railways started with the building of local isolated wooden wagonways in 1560s."}
{"sequence": "These wagonways then spread, particularly in mining areas."}
{"sequence": "The system was later built as a patchwork of local lines operated by small private railway companies."}
{"sequence": "Over the course of the 19th and early 20th centuries, these amalgamated or were bought by competitors until only a handful of larger companies remained (see Railway Mania)."}
{"sequence": "The entire network was brought under government control during the First World War and a number of advantages of amalgamation and planning were revealed."}
{"sequence": "However, the government resisted calls for the nationalisation of the network (first proposed by 19th century Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone as early as the 1830s)."}
{"sequence": "Instead, from 1 January 1923, almost all the remaining companies were grouped into the \"big four\": the Great Western Railway, the London and North Eastern Railway, the London Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway companies (there were also a number of other joint railways such as the Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway and the Cheshire Lines Committee as well as special joint railways such as the Forth Bridge Railway, Ryde Pier Railway and at one time the East London Railway)."}
{"sequence": "The \"Big Four\" were joint-stock public companies and they continued to run the railway system until 31 December 1947."}
{"sequence": "The growth in road transport during the 1920s and 1930s greatly reduced revenue for the rail companies."}
{"sequence": "Rail companies accused the government of favouring road haulage through the subsidised construction of roads."}
{"sequence": "The railways entered a slow decline owing to a lack of investment and changes in transport policy and lifestyles."}
{"sequence": "During the Second World War the companies' managements joined together, effectively forming one company."}
{"sequence": "A maintenance backlog developed during the war and the private sector only had two years to deal with this after the war ended."}
{"sequence": "After 1945, for both practical and ideological reasons, the government decided to bring the rail service into the public sector."}
{"sequence": "From the start of 1948, the \"big four\" were nationalised to form British Railways (latterly British Rail) under the control of the British Transport Commission."}
{"sequence": "Although BR was a single entity, it was divided into six (later five) regional authorities in accordance with the existing areas of operation."}
{"sequence": "Though there were few initial changes to the service, usage increased and the network became profitable."}
{"sequence": "Regeneration of track and railway stations was completed by 1954."}
{"sequence": "In the same year, changes to the British Transport Commission, including the privatisation of road haulage, ended the coordination of transport in Great Britain."}
{"sequence": "Rail revenue fell and in 1955 the network again ceased to be profitable."}
{"sequence": "The mid-1950s saw the rapid introduction of diesel and electric rolling stock, but the expected transfer back from road to rail did not occur and losses began to mount."}
{"sequence": "The desire for profitability led to a major reduction in the network during the mid-1960s, with ICI manager Dr. Richard Beeching commissioned by the government under Ernest Marples with reorganising the railways."}
{"sequence": "Many branch lines (and a number of main lines) were closed because they were deemed uneconomic (\"the Beeching Axe\" of 1963), removing much feeder traffic from main line passenger services."}
{"sequence": "In the second Beeching report of 1965, only the \"major trunk routes\" were selected for large-scale investment, leading many to speculate the rest of the network would eventually be closed."}
{"sequence": "This was never implemented by BR."}
{"sequence": "Passenger services experienced a renaissance with the introduction of the InterCity 125 trains in the 1970s."}
{"sequence": "Passenger levels fluctuated since then, increasing during periods of economic growth and falling during recessions."}
{"sequence": "The 1980s saw severe cuts in government funding and above-inflation increases in fares, In the early 1990s, the five geographical Regions were replaced by a Sectored organisation, in which passenger services were organised into InterCity, Network SouthEast and Regional Railways sectors."}
{"sequence": "British Rail operations were privatised during 1994–1997."}
{"sequence": "Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to Railtrack, whilst passenger operations were franchised to individual private sector operators (originally there were 25 franchises) and the goods services sold outright (six companies were set up, but five of these were sold to the same buyer)."}
{"sequence": "The government said privatisation would see an improvement in passenger services and satisfaction (according to the National Rail Passenger survey) has indeed gone up from 76% in 1999 (when the survey started) to 83% in 2013 and the number of passengers not satisfied with their journey dropped from 10% to 6%."}
{"sequence": "Since privatisation, passenger levels have more than doubled, and have surpassed their level in the late 1940s."}
{"sequence": "Train fares cost 2.7% more than under British Rail in real terms on average."}
{"sequence": "However, while the price of anytime and off-peak tickets has increased, the price of Advance tickets has dramatically decreased in real terms: the average Advance ticket in 1995 cost £9.14 (in 2014 prices) compared to £5.17 in 2014."}
{"sequence": "Rail subsidies have increased from £bn in 1992–93 to £bn in 2015–16 (in current prices), although subsidy per journey has fallen from £ per journey to £ per journey."}
{"sequence": "However, this masks great regional variation, as in 2014–15 funding varied from \"£1.41 per passenger journey in England to £6.51 per journey in Scotland and £8.34 per journey in Wales.\""}
{"sequence": "The public image of rail travel was severely damaged by a series of significant accidents after privatisation."}
{"sequence": "These included the Hatfield accident, caused by a rail fragmenting due to the development of microscopic cracks."}
{"sequence": "Following this, the rail infrastructure company Railtrack imposed over 1,200 emergency speed restrictions across its network and instigated an extremely costly nationwide track replacement programme."}
{"sequence": "The consequent severe operational disruption to the national network and the company's spiralling costs set in motion a series of events which resulted in the collapse of the company and its replacement with Network Rail, a state-owned, not-for-profit company."}
{"sequence": "According to the European Railway Agency, in 2013 Britain had the safest railways in Europe based on the number of train safety incidents."}
{"sequence": "At the end of September 2003, the first part of High Speed 1, a high-speed link to the Channel Tunnel and onward to France and Belgium, was completed, significantly adding to the rail infrastructure of the country."}
{"sequence": "The rest of the link, from north Kent to London St Pancras opened in 2007."}
{"sequence": "A major programme of remedial work on the West Coast Main Line started in 1997 and finished in 2008."}
{"sequence": "In the 2010s, many upgrades are under way, such as Thameslink, Crossrail, the Northern Hub and electrification of the Great Western Main Line."}
{"sequence": "Electrification plans for the Midland Main Line and the Transpennine line between Manchester and Leeds have been scaled back."}
{"sequence": "Construction of High Speed 2 is underway, with a projected completion date of 2026 for Phase 1 (London to Birmingham) and 2033 for Phase 2."}
{"sequence": "A poll of 1,500 adults in Britain in June 2018 showed that 64% support renationalising Britain's railways, 19% would oppose renationalisation and 17% did not know."}
{"sequence": "Passenger services in Great Britain are divided into regional franchises and run by private (that is, non-state owned) train operating companies."}
{"sequence": "These companies bid for seven- to eight-year contracts to run individual franchises."}
{"sequence": "Most contracts are awarded by the Department for Transport (DfT), with the exception of Merseyrail, where the franchise is awarded by Merseyside Passenger Transport Executive, and ScotRail, where the DfT awards on the advice of the Scottish Government."}
{"sequence": "Initially, there were 25 franchises, some franchises have since been combined."}
{"sequence": "There are also a number of local or specialised rail services operated on an open access basis outside the franchise arrangements."}
{"sequence": "Examples include Heathrow Express and Hull Trains."}
{"sequence": "In the 2015–16 operating year, franchised services provided 1,718 million journeys totalling (64.7 billion billion passenger km) of travel, an increase over 1994–5 of 117% in journeys (from 761 million) and just over doubling the passenger miles."}
{"sequence": "The passenger-miles figure, after being flat from 1965 to 1995, surpassed the 1947 figure for the first time in 1998 and continues to rise steeply."}
{"sequence": "The key index used to assess passenger train performance is the Public Performance Measure, which combines figures for punctuality and reliability."}
{"sequence": "From a base of 90% of trains arriving on time in 1998, the measure dipped to 75% in mid-2001 due to stringent safety restrictions put in place after the Hatfield crash in October 2000."}
{"sequence": "However, in June 2015 the PPM stood at 91.2% after a period of steady increases in the annual moving average since 2003 until around 2012 when the improvements levelled off."}
{"sequence": "Train fares cost 2.7% more than under British Rail in real terms on average."}
{"sequence": "For some years, Britain has been said to have the highest rail fares in Europe, with peak-time and season tickets considerably higher than other countries, partly because rail subsidies in Europe are higher."}
{"sequence": "However, passengers are also able to obtain some of the cheapest fares in Europe if they book in advance or travel at off-peak times or purchase 'day-return' tickets which cost little more than a single ticket."}
{"sequence": "UK rail operators point out rail fare increases have been at a substantially lower rate than petrol prices for private motoring."}
{"sequence": "The difference in price has also been blamed on the fact Britain has the most restrictive loading gauge (maximum width and height of trains that can fit through tunnels, bridges etc.)"}
{"sequence": "in the world which means any trains must be significantly narrower and less tall than those used elsewhere."}
{"sequence": "This means British trains cannot be bought \"off-the-shelf\" and must be specially built to fit British standards."}
{"sequence": "Average rolling-stock age fell slightly from the third quarter of 2001–02 to 2017–18, from 20.7 years old to 19.6 years old, and recent large orders from Bombardier, CAF, Hitachi and Stadler will bring down the average age to around 15 years by March 2021."}
{"sequence": "Although passengers rarely have cause to refer to either document, all travel is subject to the National Rail Conditions of Carriage and all tickets are valid subject to the rules set out in a number of so-called technical manuals, which are centrally produced for the network."}
{"sequence": "Below are the total number of passengers using heavy rail transport in Britain."}
{"sequence": "The numbers are calculated from September to August. ("}
{"sequence": "This table does not include Eurostar, Heathrow Express, Heathrow Connect or open access operators such as Grand Central and Hull Trains) The following table is according to the Office of Rail and Road and includes open access operators such as Grand Central and Hull Trains."}
{"sequence": "There are 2,566 passenger railway stations on the Network Rail network."}
{"sequence": "This does not include the London Underground, nor other systems which are not part of the national network, such as heritage railways."}
{"sequence": "Most date from the Victorian era and a number are in or on the edge of town and city centres."}
{"sequence": "Major stations lie for the most part in large cities, with the largest conurbations (e.g. Liverpool, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow and Manchester) typically having more than one main station."}
{"sequence": "London is a major hub of the network, with 12 main-line termini forming a \"ring\" around central London."}
{"sequence": "Birmingham, Leeds, Manchester, Glasgow, Bristol and Reading are major interchanges for many cross-country journeys that do not involve London."}
{"sequence": "However, some important railway junction stations lie in smaller cities and towns, for example York, Crewe and Ely."}
{"sequence": "Some other places expanded into towns and cities because of the railway network."}
{"sequence": "Swindon, for example, was little more than a village before the Great Western Railway chose to site its locomotive works there."}
{"sequence": "In many instances geography, politics or military considerations originally caused stations to be sited further from the towns they served until, with time, these issues could be overcome (for example, Portsmouth had its original station at Gosport)."}
{"sequence": "High-speed rail (above ) was first introduced in Great Britain in the 1970s by British Rail."}
{"sequence": "BR had pursued two development projects in parallel, the development of a tilting train technology, the Advanced Passenger Train (APT), and development of a conventional high-speed diesel train, the High Speed Train (HST)."}
{"sequence": "The APT project was abandoned, but the HST design entered service as the British Rail Classes 253, 254 and 255 trains."}
{"sequence": "The prototype HST, the Class 252, reached a world speed record for diesel trains of 143.2 mph, while the main fleet entered service limited to a service speed of 125 mph, and were introduced progressively on main lines across the country, with a rebranding of their services as the \"InterCity 125\"."}
{"sequence": "With electrification of the East Coast Main Line, high-speed rail in Great Britain was augmented with the introduction of the Class 91, intended for passenger service at up to 140 mph (225 km/h), and thus branded as the \"InterCity 225\"."}
{"sequence": "The Class 91 units were designed for a maximum service speed of 140 mph, and running at this speed was trialled with a 'flashing green' signal aspect under the British signalling system."}
{"sequence": "The trains were eventually limited to the same speed as the HST, to 125 mph, with higher speeds deemed to require cab signalling, which as of 2010 was not in place on the normal British railway network (but was used on the Channel Tunnel Rail Link)."}
{"sequence": "A final attempt by the nationalised British Rail at High Speed Rail was the cancelled InterCity 250 project in the 1990s for the West Coast Main Line."}
{"sequence": "Post privatisation, a plan to upgrade the West Coast Main Line to speeds of up to 140 mph with infrastructure improvements were finally abandoned, although the tilting train Class 390 \"Pendolino\" fleet designed for this maximum speed of service were still built and entered service in 2002, and operates limited to 125 mph."}
{"sequence": "Other routes in the UK were upgraded with trains capable of top speeds of up to 125 mph running with the introduction between 2000 and 2005 of Class 180 \"Adelante\" DMUs and the Bombardier Voyager DEMUs (Classes 220, 221 and 222)."}
{"sequence": "The first implementation of high-speed rail up to 186 mph in regular passenger service in Great Britain was the Channel Tunnel Rail Link (now known as High Speed 1), when its first phase opened in 2003 linking the British end of the Channel Tunnel at Folkestone with Fawkham Junction in Kent."}
{"sequence": "This is used by international only passenger trains for the Eurostar service, using Class 373 trains."}
{"sequence": "The line was later extended all the way into London St Pancras in 2007."}
{"sequence": "After the building of the first of a new Class 395 train fleet for use partly on High Speed 1 and parts of the rest of the UK rail network, the first domestic high-speed running over 125 mph (to about 140 mph) began in December 2009, including a special Olympic Javelin shuttle for the 2012 Summer Olympics."}
{"sequence": "These services are operated by the South Eastern franchise."}
{"sequence": "For replacement of the domestic fleet of InterCity 125 and 225 trains on the existing national network, the Intercity Express Programme was announced."}
{"sequence": "In 2009 it was announced the preferred rolling stock option for this project was the Hitachi Super Express family of multiple units, and they entered service in 2017 on the Great Western Main Line and 2019 on the East Coast Main Line."}
{"sequence": "The trains will be capable of a maximum speed of 140 mph with \"minor modifications\", with the necessary signalling modifications required of the Network Rail infrastructure in Britain likely to come from the phased rollout of the Europe-wide European Rail Traffic Management System (ERTMS)."}
{"sequence": "Following several studies and consultations on high-speed rail, in 2009 the UK Government formally announced the High Speed 2 project, establishing a company to produce a feasibility study to examine route options and financing for a new high-speed railway in the UK."}
{"sequence": "This study began on the assumption the route would be a new purpose-built high-speed line connected to High-Speed 1 to the Channel tunnel and from London to the West Midlands, via Heathrow Airport, relieving traffic on the West Coast Main Line (WCML)."}
{"sequence": "Conventional high-speed rail technology would be used as opposed to Maglev."}
{"sequence": "The rolling stock would be capable of travelling on the existing Network Rail infrastructure if required, with the route intersecting with the existing WCML and the East Coast Main Line (ECML)."}
{"sequence": "A second phase of the project is planned to reach further north to Manchester, Sheffield and Leeds, as well as linking into the Midland Main Line."}
{"sequence": "In June 2014, Chancellor of the Exchequer, George Osborne proposed a high-speed rail link High Speed 3 (also known as Northern Powerhouse Rail and High Speed North) between Liverpool and Newcastle/Sheffield/Hull."}
{"sequence": "The line would utilise the existing route between Liverpool and Newcastle/Hull and a new route from to Sheffield will follow the same route to Manchester Victoria and then a new line from Victoria to Sheffield, with additional tunnels and other infrastructure."}
{"sequence": "In August 2009 the speeds of the fastest trains operating in Great Britain capable of a top speed of over 125 mph were as follows: In 2011 the fastest timetabled start-to-stop run by a UK domestic train service was the Hull Trains 07.30 King's Cross to Hull, which covered the 125.4 km (78 miles) from Stevenage to Grantham in 42 minutes at an average speed of 179.1 km/h (111.4 mph)."}
{"sequence": "This is operated by a Class 180 diesel unit running \"under the wires\" on this East Coast route."}
{"sequence": "This was matched by several Leeds to London Class 91-operated East Coast trains if their two-minute recovery allowance for this section is excluded from the public timetable."}
{"sequence": "A number of towns and cities have rapid transit networks."}
{"sequence": "Underground technology is used in the Glasgow subway, Merseyrail centred on Liverpool, London Underground centred on London, London Overground centred on London, London Docklands Light Railway and the Tyne & Wear Metro centred on Newcastle upon Tyne."}
{"sequence": "Light rail systems in the form of trams are in Birmingham, Croydon, Manchester, Nottingham, Sheffield and Edinburgh."}
{"sequence": "These systems use a combination of street running tramways and, where available, reserved right of way or former conventional rail lines in some suburbs."}
{"sequence": "Blackpool has the one remaining traditional tram system."}
{"sequence": "Monorails, heritage tramways, miniature railways and funiculars also exist in several places."}
{"sequence": "In addition, there are a number of heritage (mainly steam) standard and narrow gauge railways, and a few industrial railways and tramways."}
{"sequence": "Some lines which appear to be heritage operations sometimes claim to be part of the public transport network; the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway in Kent regularly transports schoolchildren."}
{"sequence": "Most major cities have some form of commuter rail network."}
{"sequence": "These include Belfast, Birmingham, Bristol, Cardiff, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London and Manchester."}
{"sequence": "There are four main goods operating companies in the UK, the largest of which is DB Cargo UK (formerly DB Schenker formerly English Welsh & Scottish (EWS))."}
{"sequence": "There are also several smaller independent operators including Mendip Rail."}
{"sequence": "Types of freight carried include \"intermodal\" – in essence containerised freight – and coal, metals, oil, and construction material."}
{"sequence": "The Beeching Cuts, in contrast to passenger services, greatly modernised the goods sector, replacing inefficient wagons with containerised regional hubs."}
{"sequence": "Freight services had been in steady decline since the 1930s, initially because of the loss of manufacturing and then road haulage's cost advantage in combination with higher wages."}
{"sequence": "Since 1995, however, the amount of freight carried on the railways has increased sharply due to increased reliability and competition, as well as international services."}
{"sequence": "The Department for Transport's \"Transport Ten Year Plan\" calls for an 80% increase in rail freight measured from a 2000–1 base."}
{"sequence": "Statistics on freight are specified in terms of the weight of freight lifted, and the \"net tonne kilometre\", being freight weight multiplied by distance carried."}
{"sequence": "116.6 million tonnes of freight was lifted in the 2013–4 period, against 138 million tonnes in 1986–7, a decrease of 16%."}
{"sequence": "However, a record 22.7 billion net tonne kilometres (14 billion net ton miles) of freight movement were recorded in 2013–4, against 16.6 billion (10.1 billion) in 1986–7, an increase of 38%."}
{"sequence": "Coal makes up 36% of the total \"net tonne kilometre\", though its share is declining."}
{"sequence": "Rail freight has increased its market share since privatisation (by net tonne kilometres) from 7.4% in 1998 to 11.1% in 2013."}
{"sequence": "Recent growth is partly due to more international services including the Channel Tunnel and Port of Felixstowe, which is containerised."}
{"sequence": "Nevertheless, network bottlenecks and insufficient investment in catering for 9' 6\" high shipping containers restrict growth."}
{"sequence": "A symbolic loss to the rail freight industry in Great Britain was the custom of the Royal Mail, which from 2004 discontinued use of its 49-train fleet, and switching to road haulage after a near 170-year-preference for trains."}
{"sequence": "Mail trains had long been part of the tradition of the railways in Great Britain, famously celebrated in the film \"Night Mail\", for which W. H. Auden wrote the poem of the same name."}
{"sequence": "Although Royal Mail suspended mail trains in January 2004, this decision was reversed in December of the same year, and Class 325s are now used on some routes including between London, Warrington and Scotland."}
{"sequence": "At the time of privatisation, the rolling stock of British Rail was sold to the new operators, as in the case of the freight companies, or to the three ROSCOs (rolling stock companies) which lease or hire stock to passenger and freight train operators."}
{"sequence": "Leasing is relatively commonplace in transport since it enables operating companies to avoid the complication associated with raising sufficient capital to purchase assets; instead, assets are leased and paid for from ongoing revenue."}
{"sequence": "Since 1994 there has been a growth in smaller spot-hire companies that provide rolling stock on short-term contracts."}
{"sequence": "Many of these have grown thanks to the major selling-off of locomotives by the large freight operators, especially EWS."}
{"sequence": "Unlike other major players in the privatised railway system of Great Britain, the ROSCOs are not subject to close regulation by the economic regulatory authority."}
{"sequence": "They were expected to compete with one another, and they do, although not in all respects."}
{"sequence": "Since privatisation in 1995, the ROSCOs have faced criticism from several quarters – including passenger train operating companies such as GNER, Arriva and FirstGroup – on the basis they are acting as an oligopoly to keep lease prices higher than they would be in a competitive market."}
{"sequence": "In 1998, Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott asked Rail Regulator John Swift to investigate the market's operation and make recommendations."}
{"sequence": "Many believed Prescott favoured much closer regulation of the ROSCOs, perhaps bringing them into the net of contract-specific regulation, i.e., requiring every rolling stock lease to be approved by the Rail Regulator before it could be valid."}
{"sequence": "Swift's report did not find major problems with the operation of what was then an infant market, and instead recommended the ROSCOs sign up to voluntary, non-binding codes of practice in relation to their future behaviour."}
{"sequence": "Prescott did not like this, but he did not have the legislative time allocation to do much about it."}
{"sequence": "Swift's successor as Rail Regulator, Tom Winsor, agreed with Swift and the ROSCOs were happy to go along with codes of practice, coupled with the Rail Regulator's new powers to deal with abuse of dominance and anti-competitive behaviour under the Competition Act 1998."}
{"sequence": "In establishing these codes, the Rail Regulator made it clear he expected the ROSCOs to adhere to their letter and spirit."}
{"sequence": "The codes of practice were duly put in place and for the next five years the Rail Regulator received no complaints about ROSCO behaviour."}
{"sequence": "In July 2004, the DFT's White Paper on the future of the railways contained a statement it was dissatisfied with the operation of the rolling stock leasing market and believed there may have been excessive pricing on the part of the ROSCOs."}
{"sequence": "In June 2006, Gwyneth Dunwoody, the House of Commons Transport Committee chair, called for an investigation into the companies."}
{"sequence": "Transport commentator Christian Wolmar has asserted the high cost of leasing is due to the way the franchises are distributed to the train operating companies."}
{"sequence": "While the TOCs are negotiating for a franchise they have some freedom to propose different rolling stock options."}
{"sequence": "It is only once they have won the franchise, however, they start negotiating with the ROSCOs."}
{"sequence": "The ROSCO will know the TOC's requirements and also knows the TOC has to obtain a fixed mix of rolling stock which puts the train operating company at a disadvantage in its negotiations with the ROSCO."}
{"sequence": "On 29 November 2006, following a June 2006 complaint by the DfT alleging excessive pricing by the ROSCOs, the Office of Rail Regulation (as it was then called) announced it was minded to refer the operation of the market for passenger rolling stock to the Competition Commission, citing, amongst other factors, problems in the DfT's own franchising policy as responsible for what may be regarded as a dysfunctional market."}
{"sequence": "ORR said it will consult the industry and the public on what to do, and will publish its decision in April 2007."}
{"sequence": "If the ORR does refer the market to the Competition Commission, there may well be a hiatus in investment in new rolling stock whilst the ROSCOs and their parent companies wait to hear what return they will be allowed to make on their train fleets."}
{"sequence": "This could have the unintended consequence of intensifying the problem of overcrowding on some routes because TOCs will be unable to lengthen their trains or acquire new ones if they need the ROSCOs to co-operate in their acquisition or financing."}
{"sequence": "Some commentators have suggested that such an outcome would be detrimental to the public interest."}
{"sequence": "This is especially striking since the National Audit Office, in its November 2006 report on the renewal and upgrade of the West Coast main line, said that the capacity of the trains and the network will be full in the next few years and advocated train lengthening as an important measure to cope with sharply higher passenger numbers."}
{"sequence": "The Competition Commission conducted an investigation and published provisional findings on 7 August 2008."}
{"sequence": "The report was published on 7 April 2009."}
{"sequence": "A press release Three companies took over British Rail's rolling stock on privatisation: A number of other companies have since entered the leasing market: Spot-hire companies provide short-term leasing of rolling stock."}
{"sequence": "Railways in Great Britain are in the private sector, but they are subject to control by central government, and to economic and safety regulation by arms of government."}
{"sequence": "In 2006, using powers in the Railways Act 2005, the DfT took over most of the functions of the now wound up Strategic Rail Authority."}
{"sequence": "The DfT now itself runs competitions for the award of passenger rail franchises, and, once awarded, monitors and enforces the contracts with the private sector franchisees."}
{"sequence": "Franchises specify the passenger rail services which are to be run and the quality and other conditions (for example, the cleanliness of trains, station facilities and opening hours, the punctuality and reliability of trains) which the operators have to meet."}
{"sequence": "Some franchises receive a subsidy from the DfT for doing so, and some are cash-positive, which means the franchisee pays the DfT for the contract."}
{"sequence": "Some franchises start life as subsidised and, over their life, move to being cash-positive."}
{"sequence": "The other regulatory authority for the privatised railway is the Office of Rail and Road (previously the Office of Rail Regulation), which, following the Railways Act 2005, is the combined economic and safety regulator."}
{"sequence": "It replaced the Rail Regulator on 5 July 2004."}
{"sequence": "The Rail Safety and Standards Board still exists, however; established in 2003 on the recommendations of a public inquiry, it leads the industry's progress in health and safety matters."}
{"sequence": "The principal modern railway statutes are: The railways are one of the most heavily unionised industrial sectors in the UK."}
{"sequence": "\"See Passenger transport executive\" See List of companies operating trains in the United Kingdom."}
{"sequence": "This is only the earliest of the main line openings: for a more comprehensive list of the hundreds of early railways see List of early British railway companies Many lines closed by British Railways, including many closed during the Beeching cuts, have been restored and reopened as heritage railways."}
{"sequence": "A few have been relaid as narrow-gauge but the majority are standard-gauge."}
{"sequence": "Most use both steam and diesel locomotives for haulage."}
{"sequence": "Most heritage railways are operated as tourist attractions and do not provide regular year-round train services."}
{"sequence": "Several pressure groups are campaigning for the re-opening of closed railway lines in Great Britain."}
{"sequence": "These include: From 1995 until 2009, 27 new lines (totalling 199 track miles) and 68 stations were opened, with 65 further new station sites identified by Network Rail or government for possible construction."}
{"sequence": "The published proposals involved the re-opening or new construction of 40 stations, serving communities with populations of over 15,000, including 14 schemes involving the re-opening or reconstruction of rail lines for passenger services."}
{"sequence": "These would be short-lead-time local projects, to be completed in timescales ranging from 2 years 9 months to 6 years, once approved by local and regional governments, Network Rail and the Department for Transport, complementing existing long-term national projects."}
{"sequence": "British Rail British Railways (BR), which from 1965 traded as British Rail, was the state-owned company that operated most of the overground rail transport in Great Britain between 1948 and 1997."}
{"sequence": "It was formed from the nationalisation of the \"Big Four\" British railway companies and lasted until the gradual privatisation of British Rail, in stages between 1994 and 1997."}
{"sequence": "Originally a trading brand of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission, it became an independent statutory corporation in 1962 designated as the British Railways Board."}
{"sequence": "The period of nationalisation saw sweeping changes in the national railway network."}
{"sequence": "A process of dieselisation and electrification took place, and by 1968 steam locomotion had been entirely replaced by diesel and electric traction, except for the Vale of Rheidol Railway (a narrow-gauge tourist line)."}
{"sequence": "Passengers replaced freight as the main source of business, and one third of the network was closed by the Beeching Axe of the 1960s in an effort to reduce rail subsidies."}
{"sequence": "On privatisation, responsibility for track, signalling and stations was transferred to Railtrack (which was later brought under public control as Network Rail) and that for trains to the train operating companies."}
{"sequence": "The British Rail \"double arrow\" logo is formed of two interlocked arrows showing the direction of travel on a double track railway and was nicknamed \"the arrow of indecision\"."}
{"sequence": "It is now employed as a generic symbol on street signs in Great Britain denoting railway stations, and as part of the Rail Delivery Group's (RDG) jointly managed National Rail brand is still printed on railway tickets."}
{"sequence": "The rail transport system in Great Britain developed during the 19th century."}
{"sequence": "After the grouping of 1923 under the Railways Act 1921, there were four large railway companies, each dominating its own geographic area: the Great Western Railway (GWR), the London, Midland and Scottish Railway (LMS), the London and North Eastern Railway (LNER) and the Southern Railway (SR)."}
{"sequence": "During World War I the railways were under state control, which continued until 1921."}
{"sequence": "Complete nationalisation had been considered, and the Railways Act 1921 is sometimes considered as a precursor to that, but the concept was rejected."}
{"sequence": "Nationalisation was subsequently carried out after World War II, under the Transport Act 1947."}
{"sequence": "This Act made provision for the nationalisation of the network, as part of a policy of nationalising public services by Clement Attlee's Labour Government."}
{"sequence": "British Railways came into existence as the business name of the Railway Executive of the British Transport Commission (BTC) on 1 January 1948 when it took over the assets of the Big Four."}
{"sequence": "There were also joint railways between the Big Four and a few light railways to consider (see list of constituents of British Railways)."}
{"sequence": "Excluded from nationalisation were industrial lines like the Oxfordshire Ironstone Railway."}
{"sequence": "The London Underground – publicly owned since 1933 – was also nationalised, becoming the London Transport Executive of the British Transport Commission."}
{"sequence": "The Bicester Military Railway was already run by the government."}
{"sequence": "The electric Liverpool Overhead Railway was also excluded from nationalisation."}
{"sequence": "The Railway Executive was conscious that some lines on the (then very dense) network were unprofitable and hard to justify socially, and a programme of closures began almost immediately after nationalisation."}
{"sequence": "However, the general financial position of BR became gradually poorer, until an operating loss was recorded in 1955."}
{"sequence": "The Executive itself had been abolished in 1953 by the Conservative government, and control of BR transferred to the parent Commission."}
{"sequence": "Other changes to the British Transport Commission at the same time included the return of road haulage to the private sector."}
{"sequence": "British Railways was divided into regions which were initially based on the areas the former Big Four operated in; later, several lines were transferred between regions."}
{"sequence": "Notably, these included the former Great Central lines from the Eastern Region to the London Midland Region, and the West of England Main Line from the Southern Region to Western Region The North Eastern Region was merged with the Eastern Region in 1967."}
{"sequence": "In 1982, the regions were abolished and replaced by \"business sectors\", a process known as sectorisation."}
{"sequence": "The Anglia Region was created in late 1987, its first General Manager being John Edmonds, who began his appointment on 19 October 1987."}
{"sequence": "Full separation from the Eastern Region – apart from engineering design needs – occurred on 29 April 1988."}
{"sequence": "The report, latterly known as the \"Modernisation Plan\", was published in January 1955."}
{"sequence": "It was intended to bring the railway system into the 20th century."}
{"sequence": "A government White Paper produced in 1956 stated that modernisation would help eliminate BR's financial deficit by 1962, but the figures in both this and the original plan were produced for political reasons and not based on detailed analysis."}
{"sequence": "The aim was to increase speed, reliability, safety, and line capacity through a series of measures that would make services more attractive to passengers and freight operators, thus recovering traffic lost to the roads."}
{"sequence": "Important areas included: The government appeared to endorse the 1955 programme (costing £1.2 billion), but did so largely for political reasons."}
{"sequence": "This included the withdrawal of steam traction and its replacement by diesel (and some electric) locomotives."}
{"sequence": "Not all the modernisations would be effective at reducing costs."}
{"sequence": "The dieselisation programme gave contracts primarily to British suppliers, who had limited experience of diesel locomotive manufacture, and rushed commissioning based on an expectation of rapid electrification; this resulted in numbers of locomotives with poor designs, and a lack of standardisation."}
{"sequence": "At the same time, containerised freight was being developed."}
{"sequence": "The marshalling yard building programme was a failure, being based on a belief in the continued viability of wagon-load traffic in the face of increasingly effective road competition, and lacking effective forward planning or realistic assessments of future freight."}
{"sequence": "A 2002 documentary broadcast on BBC Radio Four blamed the 1950s decisions for the \"beleaguered\" condition of the railway system at that time."}
{"sequence": "During the late 1950s, railway finances continued to worsen, whilst passenger numbers grew after restoring many services reduced during the war, and in 1959 the government stepped in, limiting the amount the BTC could spend without ministerial authority."}
{"sequence": "A White Paper proposing reorganisation was published in the following year, and a new structure was brought into effect by the Transport Act 1962."}
{"sequence": "This abolished the commission and replaced it by several separate boards."}
{"sequence": "These included a British Railways Board, which took over on 1 January 1963."}
{"sequence": "Following semi-secret discussions on railway finances by the government-appointed Stedeford Committee in 1961, one of its members, Dr Richard Beeching, was offered the post of chairing the BTC while it lasted, and then becoming the first Chairman of the British Railways Board."}
{"sequence": "A major traffic census in April 1961, which lasted one week, was used in the compilation of a report on the future of the network."}
{"sequence": "This report—\"The Reshaping of British Railways\"—was published by the BRB in March 1963."}
{"sequence": "The proposals, which became known as the \"Beeching Axe\", were dramatic."}
{"sequence": "A third of all passenger services and more than 4,000 of the 7,000 stations would close."}
{"sequence": "Beeching, who is thought to have been the author of most of the report, set out some dire figures."}
{"sequence": "One third of the network was carrying just 1% of the traffic."}
{"sequence": "Of the 18,000 passenger coaches, 6,000 were said to be used only 18 times a year or less."}
{"sequence": "Although maintaining them cost between £3m and £4m a year, they earned only about £0.5m."}
{"sequence": "Most of the closures were carried out between 1963 and 1970 (including some which were not listed in the report) while other suggested closures were not carried out."}
{"sequence": "The closures were heavily criticised at the time."}
{"sequence": "A small number of stations and lines closed under the Beeching programme have been reopened, with further reopenings proposed."}
{"sequence": "A second Beeching report, \"The Development of the Major Trunk Routes\", followed in 1965."}
{"sequence": "This did not recommend closures as such, but outlined a \"network for development\"."}
{"sequence": "The fate of the rest of the network was not discussed in the report."}
{"sequence": "The basis for calculating passenger fares changed in 1964."}
{"sequence": "In future, fares on some routes—such as rural, holiday and commuter services—would be set at a higher level than on other routes; previously, fares had been calculated using a simple rate for the distance travelled, which at the time was 3d per mile second class, and 4½d per mile first class (equivalent to £ and £ respectively, in )."}
{"sequence": "In 1966, a \"Whites only\" recruitment policy for guards at Euston Station was dropped after the case of Asquith Xavier, a migrant from Dominica, who had been refused promotion on those grounds, was raised in Parliament and taken up by the then Secretary of State for Transport, Barbara Castle."}
{"sequence": "Passenger levels decreased steadily from 1962 to the late 1970s, and reached a low in 1982."}
{"sequence": "Network improvements included completing electrification of the Great Eastern Main Line from London to Norwich between 1976 and 1986 and the East Coast Main Line from London to Edinburgh between 1985 and 1990."}
{"sequence": "A main line route closure during this period of relative network stability was the 1500 V DC-electrified Woodhead Line between Manchester and Sheffield: passenger service ceased in 1970 and goods in 1981."}
{"sequence": "The 1980s and 1990s saw the closure of some railways which had survived the Beeching Axe a generation earlier, but which had seen passenger services withdrawn."}
{"sequence": "This included the bulk of the Chester and Connah's Quay Railway in 1992, the Brierley Hill to Walsall section of the South Staffordshire Line in 1993, while the Birmingham to Wolverhampton section of the Great Western Railway was closed in three phases between 1972 and 1992."}
{"sequence": "A further British Rail report, from a committee chaired by Sir David Serpell, was published in 1983."}
{"sequence": "The Serpell Report made no recommendations as such, but did set out various options for the network including, at their most extreme, a skeletal system of less than 2000 route km."}
{"sequence": "This report was not welcomed, and the government decided to quietly leave it on the shelf."}
{"sequence": "Meanwhile, BR was gradually reorganised, with the regional structure finally being abolished and replaced with business-led sectors."}
{"sequence": "This process, known as \"sectorisation\", led to far greater customer focus, but was cut short in 1994 with the splitting up of BR for privatisation."}
{"sequence": "Upon sectorisation in 1982, three passenger sectors were created: InterCity, operating principal express services; London & South East (renamed Network SouthEast in 1986) operating commuter services in the London area; and Provincial (renamed Regional Railways in 1989) responsible for all other passenger services."}
{"sequence": "In the metropolitan counties local services were managed by the Passenger Transport Executives."}
{"sequence": "Provincial was the most subsidised (per passenger km) of the three sectors; upon formation, its costs were four times its revenue."}
{"sequence": "During the 1980s British Rail ran the Rail Riders membership club aimed at 5- to 15-year-olds."}
{"sequence": "Because British Railways was such a large operation, running not just railways but also ferries, steamships and hotels, it has been considered difficult to analyse the effects of nationalisation."}
{"sequence": "Prices rose quickly in this period, rising 108% in real terms from 1979 to 1994, as prices rose by 262% but RPI only increased by 154% in the same time."}
{"sequence": "Following nationalisation in 1948, British Railways began to adapt the corporate liveries on the rolling stock it had inherited from its predecessor railway companies."}
{"sequence": "Initially, an express blue (followed by GWR-style Brunswick green in 1952) was used on passenger locomotives, and LNWR-style lined black for mixed-traffic locomotives, but later green was more widely adopted."}
{"sequence": "Development of a corporate identity for the organisation was hampered by the competing ambitions of the British Transport Commission and the Railway Executive."}
{"sequence": "The Executive attempted to introduce a modern an Art Deco-style curved logo which could also serve as the standard for station signage totems."}
{"sequence": "BR eventually adopted the common branding of the BTC as its first corporate logo, a lion astride a spoked wheel, designed for the BTC by Cecil Thomas; on the bar overlaid across the wheel, the BTC's name was replaced with the words \"British Railways\"."}
{"sequence": "This logo, nicknamed the \"Cycling Lion\", was applied from 1948 to 1956 to the sides of locomotives, while the oval style was adopted for station signs across Great Britain, each coloured according to the appropriate BR region, using the Gill Sans font first adopted by LNER in 1923."}
{"sequence": "In 1956, the BTC was granted a heraldic achievement by the College of Arms and the Lord Lyon, and then BTC chairman Brian Robertson wanted a grander logo for the railways."}
{"sequence": "BR's second corporate logo (1956–1965), designed in consultation with Charles Franklyn, adapted the original, depicting a rampant lion emerging from a heraldic crown and holding a spoked wheel, all enclosed in a roundel with the \"British Railways\" name displayed across a bar on either side."}
{"sequence": "This emblem soon acquired the nickname of the \"Ferret and Dartboard\"."}
{"sequence": "A variant of the logo with the name in a circle was also used on locomotives."}
{"sequence": "The zeal for modernisation in the Beeching era drove the next rebranding exercise, and BR management wished to divest the organisation of anachronistic, heraldic motifs and develop a corporate identity to rival that of London Transport."}
{"sequence": "BR's design panel set up a working party led by Milner Gray of the Design Research Unit."}
{"sequence": "They drew up a Corporate Identity Manual which established a coherent brand and design standard for the whole organisation, specifying Rail Blue and pearl grey as the standard colour scheme for all rolling stock; Rail Alphabet as the standard corporate typeface, designed by Jock Kinneir and Margaret Calvert; and introducing the now-iconic Corporate Identity Symbol of the \"Double Arrow\" logo."}
{"sequence": "Designed by Gerald Barney (also of the DRU), this arrow device was formed of two interlocked arrows across two parallel lines, symbolising a double track railway."}
{"sequence": "It was likened to a bolt of lightning or barbed wire, and also acquired a nickname: \"the arrow of indecision\"."}
{"sequence": "A mirror image of the double arrow was used on the port side of BR-owned Sealink ferry funnels."}
{"sequence": "The new BR corporate identity and Double Arrow were rolled out in 1965, and the brand name of the organisation was truncated to \"British Rail\"."}
{"sequence": "The uniformity of BR branding continued until the process of sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s."}
{"sequence": "Certain BR operations such as Inter-City, Network SouthEast, Regional Railways or Railfreight began to adopt their own identities, introducing logos and colour schemes which were essentially variants of the British Rail brand."}
{"sequence": "Eventually, as sectorisation developed into a prelude to privatisation, the unified British Rail brand disappeared, with the notable exception of the Double Arrow symbol, which has survived to this day and serves as a generic trademark to denote railway services across Great Britain."}
{"sequence": "The BR Corporate Identity Manual is noted as a piece of British design history and there are plans for it to be re-published."}
{"sequence": "Despite its nationalisation in 1947 \"as one of the 'commanding heights' of the economy\", according to some sources British Rail was not profitable for most (if not all) of its history."}
{"sequence": "Newspapers reported that as recently as the 1990s, public rail subsidy was counted as profit; as early as 1961, British Railways were losing £300,000 a day."}
{"sequence": "Although the company was considered the sole public-transport option in many rural areas, the Beeching cuts made buses the only public transport available in some rural areas."}
{"sequence": "Despite increases in traffic congestion and road fuel prices beginning to rise in the 1990s, British Rail remained unprofitable."}
{"sequence": "Following sectorisation, InterCity became profitable."}
{"sequence": "InterCity became one of Britain's top 150 companies, providing city centre to city centre travel across the nation from Aberdeen and Inverness in the north, to Poole and Penzance in the south."}
{"sequence": "In 1979 the incoming Conservative Government led by Margaret Thatcher was viewed as anti-railway, and did not want to commit public money to the railways."}
{"sequence": "However, British Rail was allowed to spend its own money with government approval."}
{"sequence": "This led to a number of electrification projects being given the go-ahead, including the East Coast Main Line, the spur from Doncaster to Leeds, and the lines in East Anglia out of London Liverpool Street to Norwich and King's Lynn."}
{"sequence": "The list with approximate completion dates includes: In the Southwest, the line from Bournemouth to Weymouth was electrified along with other infill 750 V DC 3rd rail electrification in the south."}
{"sequence": "In 1988, the line to Aberdare was reopened."}
{"sequence": "A British Rail advertisement (\"Britain's Railway\", directed by Hugh Hudson) featured some of the best known railway structures in Britain, including the Forth Rail Bridge, Royal Albert Bridge, Glenfinnan Viaduct and London Paddington station."}
{"sequence": "London Liverpool Street station was rebuilt, opened by Queen Elizabeth II, and a new station was constructed at Stansted Airport in 1991."}
{"sequence": "The following year, the Maesteg Line was reopened."}
{"sequence": "In 1988, the Windsor Link Line, Greater Manchester was constructed and has proven to be an important piece of infrastructure."}
{"sequence": "In 1989, the narrow-gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway was preserved, becoming the first part of British Rail to be privatised."}
{"sequence": "Between 1994 and 1997, British Rail was privatised."}
{"sequence": "Ownership of the track and infrastructure passed to Railtrack on 1 April 1994."}
{"sequence": "Passenger operations were later franchised to 25 private-sector operators and the freight services were sold to six companies, five of whom were owned by the same buyer."}
{"sequence": "The Waterloo & City line, part of BR Network SouthEast, was not included in the privatisation and was transferred to London Underground in April 1994."}
{"sequence": "The remaining obligations of British Rail were transferred to BRB (Residuary) Limited."}
{"sequence": "The privatisation, proposed by the Conservative government in 1992, was opposed by the Labour Party and the rail unions."}
{"sequence": "Although Labour initially proposed to reverse privatisation, the New Labour manifesto of 1997 instead opposed Conservative plans to privatise the London Underground."}
{"sequence": "Rail unions have historically opposed privatisation, but former Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen general secretary Lew Adams moved to work for Virgin Trains, and said on a 2004 radio phone-in programme: \"All the time it was in the public sector, all we got were cuts, cuts, cuts."}
{"sequence": "And today there are more members in the trade union, more train drivers, and more trains running."}
{"sequence": "The reality is that it worked, we've protected jobs, and we got more jobs.\""}
{"sequence": "The former BR network, with the trunk routes of the West Coast Main Line, East Coast Main Line, Great Western Main Line, Great Eastern Main Line and Midland Main Line, and other lines."}
{"sequence": "The narrow-gauge Vale of Rheidol Railway in Ceredigion, Wales became part of British Railways at nationalisation."}
{"sequence": "Although built as a working railway, in 1948 the line was principally a tourist attraction."}
{"sequence": "British Rail operated the line using steam locomotives, long after the withdrawal of standard-gauge steam."}
{"sequence": "The line's three steam locomotives were the only ones to receive TOPS serial numbers and be painted in BR Rail Blue livery with the double arrow logo."}
{"sequence": "The Vale of Rheidol Railway was privatised in 1989 and continues to operate as a private heritage railway."}
{"sequence": "Other preserved lines, or heritage railways, have reopened lines previously closed by British Rail."}
{"sequence": "These range from picturesque rural branch lines like the Keighley and Worth Valley Railway to sections of mainline such as the Great Central Railway."}
{"sequence": "Although most are operated solely as leisure amenities some also provide educational resources, and a few have ambitions to restore commercial services over routes abandoned by the nationalised industry."}
{"sequence": "British Railways operated ships from its formation in 1948 on several routes."}
{"sequence": "Many ships were acquired on nationalisation, and others were built for operation by British Railways or its later subsidiary, Sealink."}
{"sequence": "Those ships capable of carrying rail vehicles were classed under TOPS as Class 99."}
{"sequence": "Sealink was originally the brand name for the ferry services of British Rail in the United Kingdom and Ireland."}
{"sequence": "Services to France, Belgium, and the Netherlands were run by Sealink UK as part of the Sealink consortium which also used ferries owned by French national railways (SNCF), the Belgian Maritime Transport Authority Regie voor Maritiem Transport/Regie des transports maritimes (RMT/RTM) and the Dutch Stoomvaart Maatschappij Zeeland (Zeeland Steamship Company)."}
{"sequence": "Historically, the shipping services were exclusively an extension of the railways across the English Channel and the Irish Sea in order to provide through, integrated services to Europe and Ireland."}
{"sequence": "As international travel became more popular in the late 1960s and before air travel became generally affordable, the responsibility for shipping services was taken away from the British Rail Regions and in 1969 centralised in a new division – British Rail Shipping and International Services Division."}
{"sequence": "With the advent of car ferry services, the old passenger-only ferries were gradually replaced by roll-on/roll-off ships, catering for motorists and rail passengers as well as road freight."}
{"sequence": "However, given that there was now competition in the form of other ferry companies offering crossings to motorists, it became necessary to market the services in a normal business fashion (as opposed to the previous almost monopolistic situation)."}
{"sequence": "Thus, with the other partners mentioned above, the brand name Sealink was introduced for the consortium."}
{"sequence": "In the late 1960s, as demand for international rail travel declined and the shipping business became almost exclusively dependent on passenger and freight vehicle traffic, the ferry business was incorporated as Sealink UK Limited on 1 January 1979, a wholly owned subsidiary of the British Railways Board, but still part of the Sealink consortium."}
{"sequence": "In 1979, Sealink acquired Manx Line which offered services to the Isle of Man from Heysham."}
{"sequence": "On 27 July 1984 the UK Government sold Sealink UK Limited to Sea Containers for £66m and the company was renamed Sealink British Ferries."}
{"sequence": "The sale excluded the operations of Hoverspeed, the Isle of Wight services and the share in the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company, as well as the Port of Heysham."}
{"sequence": "In 1996, the Sealink name disappeared when the UK services, by then owned by Stena, were re-branded as Stena Line."}
{"sequence": "The agreement with the SNCF on the Dover to Calais route also ended at this time and the French-run Sealink services were rebranded as SeaFrance."}
{"sequence": "The joint hovercraft services of British Rail (under British Rail Hovercraft Limited) in association with the French SNCF."}
{"sequence": "British Rail Hovercraft Limited was established in 1965, under authority given to it by the British Railways Act 1967 and started its first service in 1966."}
{"sequence": "Seaspeed started cross-Channel services from Dover, England to Calais and Boulogne-sur-Mer, France using SR-N4 hovercraft in August 1968."}
{"sequence": "Incorporated on 31 October 1969, British Rail Engineering Limited (BREL) was a wholly owned railway systems engineering subsidiary of the British Railways Board."}
{"sequence": "Created through the Transport Act 1968, to manage BR's thirteen workshops, it replaced the British Rail Workshops Division which had existed since 1948."}
{"sequence": "The works managed by BREL were Ashford, Crewe, Derby Locomotive Works, Derby Litchurch Lane, Doncaster, Eastleigh, Glasgow (formerly St Rollox), Horwich Foundry, Shildon, Swindon, Temple Mills, Wolverton, and York."}
{"sequence": "BREL began trading in 1970 under managing director A.E. Robson."}
{"sequence": "In 1989 the design and construction of trains in the UK was privatised, and BREL ceased to exist."}
{"sequence": "A family of railway carriages, designed and built by British Rail workshops (from 1969 British Rail Engineering Limited) between 1964 and 1975."}
{"sequence": "They were of steel construction."}
{"sequence": "Many remain in service to this day."}
{"sequence": "In the 1970s, British Rail developed tilting train technology in the Advanced Passenger Train; there had been earlier experiments and prototypes in other countries, notably Italy."}
{"sequence": "The objective of the tilt was to minimise the discomfort to passengers caused by taking the curves of the West Coast Main Line at high speed."}
{"sequence": "The APT also had hydrokinetic brakes, which enabled the train to stop from 150 mph within existing signal spacings."}
{"sequence": "The introduction into service of the Advanced Passenger Train was to be a three-stage project."}
{"sequence": "Phase 1, the development of an experimental APT (APT-E), was completed."}
{"sequence": "This used a gas turbine-electric locomotive, the only multiple unit so powered that was used by British Rail."}
{"sequence": "It was formed of two power cars (numbers PC1 and PC2), initially with nothing between them and later, two trailer cars (TC1 and TC2)."}
{"sequence": "The cars were made of aluminium to reduce the weight of the unit and were articulated."}
{"sequence": "The gas turbine was dropped from development, due to excessive noise and the high fuel costs of the late 1970s."}
{"sequence": "The APT-E first ran on 25 July 1971."}
{"sequence": "The train drivers' union, ASLEF, black-listed the train due to its use of a single driver."}
{"sequence": "The train was moved to Derby (with the aid of a locomotive inspector)."}
{"sequence": "This triggered a one-day strike by ASLEF that cost BR more than the research budget for the entire year."}
{"sequence": "Phase 2, the introduction of three prototype trains (APT-P) into revenue service on the Glasgow – London Euston route, did occur."}
{"sequence": "Originally, there were to have been eight APT-P sets running, with minimal differences between them and the main fleet."}
{"sequence": "However, financial constraints lead to only three being authorised, after two years of discussion by the British Railways Board."}
{"sequence": "The cost was split equally between the Board and the Ministry of Transport."}
{"sequence": "After these delays, considerable pressure grew to put the APT-P into revenue-service before they were fully ready."}
{"sequence": "This inevitably lead to high-profile failures as a result of technical problems."}
{"sequence": "These failures led to the trains being withdrawn from service while the problems were ironed out."}
{"sequence": "However, by this time, managerial and political support had evaporated."}
{"sequence": "Consequently, phase 3, the introduction of the Squadron fleet (APT-S), did not occur, and the project was ended in 1982."}
{"sequence": "Although the APT never properly entered service, the experience gained enabled the construction of other high-speed trains."}
{"sequence": "The APT powercar technology was imported without the tilt into the design of the Class 91 locomotives, and the tilting technology was incorporated into Italian State Railway's Pendolino trains, which first entered service in 1987."}
{"sequence": "The InterCity 125 (originally Inter-City 125, or High Speed Train) is a diesel-powered passenger train built by British Rail Engineering Limited between 1975 and 1982."}
{"sequence": "Widely credited with saving British Rail, it is usually called HST."}
{"sequence": "Each set is made up of two Class 43 power cars, one at each end and six to nine Mark 3 carriages."}
{"sequence": "Initially the sets were classified as Classes 253 and 254."}
{"sequence": "The prototype InterCity 125 (power cars 43000 and 43001) set the world speed record for diesel traction at on 12 June 1973."}
{"sequence": "Under the process of British Rail's privatisation, operations were split into more than 100 companies."}
{"sequence": "The ownership and operation of the infrastructure of the railway system was taken over by Railtrack."}
{"sequence": "The Telecomms infrastructure and British Rail Telecommunications was sold to Racal, which in turn was sold to Global Crossing and merged with Thales Group."}
{"sequence": "The rolling stock was transferred to three private rolling stock companies (ROSCOs)."}
{"sequence": "Passenger services were divided into 25 operating companies, which were let on a franchise basis for a set period, whilst goods services were sold off completely."}
{"sequence": "Dozens of smaller engineering and maintenance companies were also created and sold off."}
{"sequence": "British Rail's passenger services came to an end upon the franchising of ScotRail; the final train that the company operated was a Railfreight Distribution goods train in autumn 1997."}
{"sequence": "The British Railways Board continued in existence as a corporation until early 2001, when it was replaced with the Strategic Rail Authority."}
{"sequence": "Since privatisation, the structure of the rail industry and number of companies has changed several times as franchises have been re-let and the areas covered by franchises restructured."}
{"sequence": "Franchise-based companies that took over passenger rail services include: Since privatisation, many groups have campaigned for the renationalisation of British Rail, most notably 'Bring Back British Rail'."}
{"sequence": "Various interested parties also have views on the privatisation of British Rail."}
{"sequence": "The renationalisation of the railways of Britain continues to have popular support."}
{"sequence": "Polls in 2012 and 2013 showed 70% and 66% support for renationalisation, respectively."}
{"sequence": "Due to rail franchises lasting sometimes over a decade, full renationalisation would take years unless compensation was paid to terminate contracts early."}
{"sequence": "When the infrastructure-owning company Railtrack ceased trading in 2002, the Labour government set up the not-for-dividend company Network Rail to take over the duties rather than renationalise this part of the network."}
{"sequence": "However, in September 2014, Network Rail was reclassified as a central government body, adding around £34 billion to public sector net debt."}
{"sequence": "This reclassification had been requested by the Office for Budget Responsibility to comply with pan-European accounting standard ESA10."}
{"sequence": "The Green party has committed to bringing the railways 'back into public ownership' and has maintained this impetus when other parties argued to maintain the status quo."}
{"sequence": "In 2016, Green MP, Caroline Lucas, put forward a Bill that would have seen the rail network fall back into public ownership step by step, as franchises come up for expiry."}
{"sequence": "Under Jeremy Corbyn (2015–2020), the Labour Party pledged to gradually renationalise British Rail franchises if elected, as and when their private contracts expire, creating a \"People's Railway\"."}
{"sequence": "In a pledge during his successful leadership campaign to succeed Corbyn, Keir Starmer said that renationalising rail would remain as Labour Party policy under his leadership."}
{"sequence": "In 1989, the ITV Sketch Show \"Spitting Image\" parodied Hudson's 1988 \"British Rail, Britain's Railway\" advert on the plans of the then Conservative British Government to privatise the railways featuring many of the show's puppets (including the show's portrayal of former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher), numerous BR trains and landmarks and even a cardboard cutout of Thomas the Tank Engine."}
{"sequence": "It addresses the problem of theodicy, meaning the vindication of the justice of God in the light of humanity's suffering."}
{"sequence": "A rich theological work setting out a variety of perspectives, it has been widely and extravagantly praised for its literary qualities, with Alfred Lord Tennyson calling it \"the greatest poem of ancient and modern times\"."}
{"sequence": "It is found in the Ketuvim (\"Writings\") section of the Hebrew Bible (Tanakh), and is the first poetic book in the Old Testament of the Christian Bible."}
{"sequence": "Scholars believe that it was written between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Job consists of a prose prologue and epilogue narrative framing poetic dialogues and monologues."}
{"sequence": "It is common to view the narrative frame as the original core of the book, enlarged later by the poetic dialogues and discourses, and sections of the book such as the Elihu speeches and the wisdom poem of chapter 28 as late insertions, but recent trends have tended to concentrate on the book's underlying editorial unity."}
{"sequence": "Job's opening monologue\" ( – seen by some scholars as a bridge between the prologue and the dialogues and by others as the beginning of the dialogues), and three cycles of \"dialogues between Job and his three friends\" ( – the third cycle is not complete, the expected speech of Zophar being replaced by the wisdom poem of chapter 28) 3."}
{"sequence": "Three monologues: 4."}
{"sequence": "Two \"speeches by God\" (chapters 38:1–40:2 and 40:6–41:34, 42:7–8), with \"Job's responses\" 5. \""}
{"sequence": "Epilogue\" – Job's restoration (chapters 42:9–17)."}
{"sequence": "The prologue on Earth introduces Job as a righteous man, blessed with wealth, sons, and daughters, who lives in the land of Uz."}
{"sequence": "The scene shifts to Heaven, where God asks Satan ( – \"haśśāṭān\", literally \"the accuser\") for his opinion of Job's piety."}
{"sequence": "Satan accuses Job of being pious only because God has materially blessed him; if God were to take away everything that Job has, then he would surely curse God."}
{"sequence": "God gives Satan permission to take Job's wealth and kill his children and servants, but Job nonetheless praises God: \"Naked I came out of my mother's womb, and naked shall I return: the Lord has given, and the Lord has taken away; blessed be the name of the Lord.\""}
{"sequence": "God allows Satan to afflict his body with boils."}
{"sequence": "Job sits in ashes, and his wife prompts him to \"curse God, and die\", but Job answers: \"Shall we receive good from God and shall we not receive evil?\""}
{"sequence": "Job laments the day of his birth; he would like to die, but even that is denied to him."}
{"sequence": "His three friends, Eliphaz the Temanite, Bildad the Shuhite and Zophar the Naamathite, console him."}
{"sequence": "However, they accuse Job of committing sin and believe that his suffering derived from God's judgement and thus, warranted."}
{"sequence": "Job responds with scorn: his interlocutors are \"miserable comforters\" (Vulgate ), since a just God would not treat him so harshly, patience in suffering is impossible, and the Creator should not take his creatures so lightly, to come against them with such force."}
{"sequence": "Job's responses represent one of the most radical restatements of Israelite theology in the Hebrew Bible."}
{"sequence": "He moves away from the pious attitude as shown in the prologue and begins to berate God for the disproportionate wrath against him."}
{"sequence": "He sees God as, among others, intrusive and suffocating (7:17–19); unforgiving and obsessed with destroying a human target (7:20–21); angry (9:13; 14:13; 16:9; 19:11); fixated on punishment (10:13–14); and hostile and destructive (16:11–14)."}
{"sequence": "He then shifts his focus from the injustice that he himself suffers to God's governance of the world."}
{"sequence": "He suggests that the wicked have taken advantage of the needy and the helpless, who remain in significant hardship, but God does nothing to punish them (24:1–12)."}
{"sequence": "The dialogues of Job and his friends are followed by a poem (the \"hymn to wisdom\") on the inaccessibility of wisdom: \"Where is wisdom to be found?\""}
{"sequence": "it asks, and concludes that it has been hidden from man (chapter 28)."}
{"sequence": "Job contrasts his previous fortune with his present plight, an outcast, mocked and in pain."}
{"sequence": "He protests his innocence, lists the principles he has lived by, and demands that God answer him."}
{"sequence": "Elihu (a character not previously mentioned) intervenes to state that wisdom comes from God, who reveals it through dreams and visions to those who will then declare their knowledge."}
{"sequence": "God speaks from a whirlwind."}
{"sequence": "His speeches neither explain Job's suffering, nor defend divine justice, nor enter into the courtroom confrontation that Job has demanded, nor respond to his oath of innocence."}
{"sequence": "Instead they contrast Job's weakness with divine wisdom and omnipotence: \"Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth?\""}
{"sequence": "Job makes a brief response, but God's monologue resumes, never addressing Job directly."}
{"sequence": "In 42:1–6 Job makes his final response, confessing God's power and his own lack of knowledge \"of things beyond me which I did not know\"."}
{"sequence": "Previously he has only heard, but now his eyes have seen God, and \"therefore I retract/ And repent in dust and ashes.\""}
{"sequence": "God tells Eliphaz that he and the two other friends \"have not spoken of me what is right as my servant Job has done\"."}
{"sequence": "The three (Elihu, the fourth friend introduced in chapter 32 is not mentioned here) are told to make a burnt offering with Job as their intercessor, \"for only to him will I show favour\"."}
{"sequence": "Job is restored to health, riches and family, and lives to see his children to the fourth generation."}
{"sequence": "Job appears in the 6th-century BCE Book of Ezekiel as a man of antiquity renowned for his righteousness, and the author of the Book of Job has apparently chosen this legendary hero for his parable."}
{"sequence": "Rabbinic tradition ascribes it to Moses, but scholars generally agree that it was written between the 7th and 4th centuries BCE, with the 6th century BCE as the most likely period for various reasons."}
{"sequence": "The anonymous author was almost certainly an Israelite, although he has set his story outside Israel, in southern Edom or northern Arabia, and makes allusion to places as far apart as Mesopotamia and Egypt."}
{"sequence": "The language of Job stands out for its conservative spelling and for its exceptionally large number of words and forms not found elsewhere in the Bible."}
{"sequence": "Many later scholars down to the 20th century looked for an Aramaic, Arabic or Edomite original, but a close analysis suggests that the foreign words and foreign-looking forms are literary affectations designed to lend authenticity to the book's distant setting and give it a foreign flavor."}
{"sequence": "Job exists in a number of forms: the Hebrew Masoretic Text, which underlies many modern Bible translations; the Greek Septuagint made in Egypt in the last centuries BCE; and Aramaic and Hebrew manuscripts found among the Dead Sea Scrolls."}
{"sequence": "Job, Ecclesiastes and the Book of Proverbs belong to the genre of wisdom literature, sharing a perspective that they themselves call the \"way of wisdom\"."}
{"sequence": "Wisdom means both a way of thinking and a body of knowledge gained through such thinking, as well as the ability to apply it to life."}
{"sequence": "It is attainable in part through human effort and in part as a gift from God, but never in its entirety – except by God."}
{"sequence": "The three books share attitudes and assumptions but differ in their conclusions: Proverbs makes confident statements about the world and its workings that are flatly contradicted by Job and Ecclesiastes."}
{"sequence": "Wisdom literature from Sumeria and Babylonia can be dated to the second millennium BCE."}
{"sequence": "Several texts from ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt offer parallels to Job, and while it is impossible to tell whether the author of Job was influenced by any of them, their existence suggests that he was the recipient of a long tradition of reflection on the existence of inexplicable suffering."}
{"sequence": "Job is an investigation of the problem of divine justice."}
{"sequence": "This problem, known in theology as the problem of evil, can be rephrased as a question: \"Why do the righteous suffer?\""}
{"sequence": "The conventional answer in ancient Israel was that God rewards virtue and punishes sin (the principle known as \"retributive justice\")."}
{"sequence": "This assumes a world in which human choices and actions are morally significant, but experience demonstrates that suffering is frequently unmerited."}
{"sequence": "The biblical concept of righteousness was rooted in the covenant-making God who had ordered creation for communal well-being, and the righteous were those who invested in the community, showing special concern for the poor and needy (see Job's description of his life in chapter 31)."}
{"sequence": "Their antithesis were the wicked, who were selfish and greedy."}
{"sequence": "The Satan (or The Adversary) raises the question of whether there is such a thing as disinterested righteousness: if God rewards righteousness with prosperity, will men not act righteously from selfish motives?"}
{"sequence": "He asks God to test this by removing the prosperity of Job, the most righteous of all God's servants."}
{"sequence": "The book begins with the frame narrative, giving the reader an omniscient \"God's eye perspective\" which introduces Job as a man of exemplary faith and piety, \"blameless and upright\", who \"fears God\" and \"shuns evil\"."}
{"sequence": "The contrast between the frame and the poetic dialogues and monologues, in which Job never learns of the opening scenes in heaven or of the reason for his suffering, creates a sense of dramatic irony between the divine view of the Adversary's wager, and the human view of Job's suffering \"without any reason\" (2:3)."}
{"sequence": "In the poetic dialogues Job's friends see his suffering and assume he must be guilty, since God is just."}
{"sequence": "Job, knowing he is innocent, concludes that God must be unjust."}
{"sequence": "He retains his piety throughout the story (contradicting Satan's suspicion that his righteousness is due to the expectation of reward), but makes clear from his first speech that he agrees with his friends that God should and does reward righteousness."}
{"sequence": "Elihu rejects the arguments of both parties: Job is wrong to accuse God of injustice, as God is greater than human beings, and nor are the friends correct; for suffering, far from being a punishment, may \"rescue the afflicted from their affliction\" and make them more amenable to revelation – literally, \"open their ears\" (36:15)."}
{"sequence": "Chapter 28, the Hymn to Wisdom, introduces another theme, divine wisdom."}
{"sequence": "The hymn does not place any emphasis on retributive justice, stressing instead the inaccessibility of wisdom."}
{"sequence": "Wisdom cannot be invented or purchased, it says; God alone knows the meaning of the world, and he grants it only to those who live in reverence before him."}
{"sequence": "God possesses wisdom because he grasps the complexities of the world (28:24–26) – a theme which looks forward to God's speech in chapters 38–41 with its repeated refrain \"Where were you when...?\""}
{"sequence": "When God finally speaks he neither explains the reason for Job's suffering (revealed to the reader in the prologue in heaven) nor defends his justice."}
{"sequence": "The first speech focuses on his role in maintaining order in the universe: the list of things that God does and Job cannot do demonstrates divine wisdom because order is the heart of wisdom."}
{"sequence": "Job then confesses his lack of wisdom, meaning his lack of understanding of the workings of the cosmos and of the ability to maintain it."}
{"sequence": "The second speech concerns God's role in controlling behemoth and leviathan, sometimes translated as the hippopotamus and crocodile, but more probably representing primeval cosmic creatures, in either case demonstrating God's wisdom and power."}
{"sequence": "Job's reply to God's final speech is longer than his first and more complicated."}
{"sequence": "The usual view is that he admits to being wrong to challenge God and now repents \"in dust and ashes\" (42:6), but the Hebrew is difficult, and an alternative understanding is that Job says he was wrong to repent and mourn and does not retract any of his arguments."}
{"sequence": "In the concluding part of the frame narrative God restores and increases his prosperity, indicating that the divine policy on retributive justice remains unchanged."}
{"sequence": "In the Second Temple period (500 BCE – 70 CE) Job began being transformed into something more patient and steadfast, with his suffering a test of virtue and a vindication of righteousness for the glory of God."}
{"sequence": "The process of \"sanctifying\" Job began with the Greek Septuagint translation (c. 200 BCE) and was furthered in the Testament of Job (1st century BCE – 1st century CE), which makes him the hero of patience."}
{"sequence": "This reading pays little attention to the Job of the dialogue sections of the book, but it was the tradition taken up by the Epistle of James in the New Testament, which presents Job as one whose patience and endurance should be emulated by believers (James 5:7–11)."}
{"sequence": "When Christianity began interpreting Job 19:23–29 (verses concerning a \"redeemer\" whom Job hopes can save him from God) as a prophecy of Christ, the predominant Jewish view became \"Job the blasphemer\", with some rabbis even saying that he was rightly punished by God because he had stood by while Pharaoh massacred the innocent Jewish infants."}
{"sequence": "Augustine of Hippo recorded that Job had prophesied the coming of Christ, and Gregory the Great offered him as a model of right living worthy of respect."}
{"sequence": "The medieval Jewish scholar Maimonides declared his story a parable, and the medieval Christian Thomas Aquinas wrote a detailed commentary declaring it true history."}
{"sequence": "In the Reformation Martin Luther explained how Job's confession of sinfulness and worthlessness underlay his saintliness, and John Calvin's Job demonstrated the doctrine of the resurrection and the ultimate certainty of divine justice."}
{"sequence": "The contemporary movement known as creation theology, an ecological theology valuing the needs of all creation, interprets God's speeches in Job 38–41 to imply that his interests and actions are not exclusively focused on humankind."}
{"sequence": "Jewish liturgy does not use readings from the Book of Job in the manner of the Pentateuch, Prophets, or Five Megillot, although it is quoted at funerals and times of mourning."}
{"sequence": "However, there are some Jews, particularly the Spanish and Portuguese Jews, who do hold public readings of Job on the Tisha B'Av fast (a day of mourning over the destruction of the First and Second Temples and other tragedies)."}
{"sequence": "The cantillation signs for the large poetic section in the middle of the Book of Job differ from those of most of the biblical books, using a system shared with it only by Psalms and Proverbs."}
{"sequence": "The Eastern Orthodox Church reads from Job and Exodus during Holy Week."}
{"sequence": "Exodus prepares for the understanding of Christ's exodus to his Father, of his fulfillment of the whole history of salvation; Job, the sufferer, is the Old Testament icon of Christ."}
{"sequence": "The Roman Catholic Church reads from Job during Matins in the first two weeks of September and in the Office of the Dead, and in the revised Liturgy of the Hours Job is read during the Eighth and Ninth Weeks in Ordinary Time."}
{"sequence": "The Book of Job has been deeply influential in Western culture, to such an extent that no list could be more than representative."}
{"sequence": "Musical settings from Job include Orlande de Lassus's 1565 cycle of motets, the \"Sacrae Lectiones Novem ex Propheta Job\", and George Frideric Handel's use of Job 19:25 (\"I know that my redeemer liveth\") as an aria in his 1741 oratorio \"Messiah\"."}
{"sequence": "Joni Mitchell composed The Sire of Sorrow (Job's Sad Song.)"}
{"sequence": "Neil Simon wrote \"God's Favorite\" which is a modern retelling of the Book of Job."}
{"sequence": "Breughel and Georges de la Tour depicted Job visited by his wife, and William Blake produced an entire cycle of illustrations for the book."}
{"sequence": "Writers Job has inspired or influenced include John Milton (\"Samson Agonistes\"), Dostoevsky (\"The Brothers Karamazov\"), Alfred Doblin (\"Berlin Alexanderplatz\"), Franz Kafka (\"The Trial\"), Carl Jung (\"Answer to Job\"), Joseph Roth (\"Job\"), Bernard Malamud and Elizabeth Brewster, whose book \"Footnotes to the Book of Job\" was a finalist for the 1996 Governor General's Award for poetry in Canada."}
{"sequence": "Archibald MacLeish's drama, \"JB\", one of the most prominent uses of the Book of Job in modern literature, was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1959."}
{"sequence": "Job's influence can also be seen in the Coen brothers' 2009 film, \"A Serious Man\", which was nominated for two Academy Awards."}
{"sequence": "Terrence Malick's 2011 film \"The Tree of Life\", which won the Palme d'Or, is heavily influenced by the themes of the Book of Job, as the film starts with a quote from the beginning of God's speech to Job."}
{"sequence": "A 2014 Malayalam film called \"Iyobinte Pusthakam\" tells the story of a man who is losing everything in his life and also has parallels with Dostoevsky's (\"The Brothers Karamazov\")."}
{"sequence": "The Russian film \"Leviathan\" also draws themes from the Book of Job."}
{"sequence": "In 2015 two Ukrainian composers Roman Grygoriv and Illia Razumeiko created opera-requiem IYOV."}
{"sequence": "The premiere of the opera was held on 21 September 2015 on the main stage of the international multidisciplinary festival Gogolfest."}
{"sequence": "Job (Arabic \"Ayyub\" ايوب) is one of the 25 prophets mentioned by name in the Quran, where he is lauded as a steadfast and upright worshiper (Q.38:44)."}
{"sequence": "His story has the same basic outline as in the Bible, although the three friends are replaced by his brothers, and his wife stays by his side."}
{"sequence": "In Palestinian folklore Job's place of trial is Al-Joura, a village outside the town of Al Majdal (Ashkelon)."}
{"sequence": "It was there that God rewarded him with a Fountain of Youth that removed whatever illnesses he had and restored his youth."}
{"sequence": "Al-Joura was a place of annual festivities (four days in all) when people of many faiths gathered and bathed in a natural spring."}

{"sequence": "Book of Proverbs The Book of Proverbs (Hebrew: מִשְלֵי, \"Míshlê (Shlomoh)\", \"Proverbs (of Solomon)\") is a book in the third section (called Ketuvim) of the Hebrew Bible and a book of the Christian Old Testament."}
{"sequence": "When translated into Greek and Latin, the title took on different forms: in the Greek Septuagint (LXX) it became Παροιμίαι \"Paroimiai\" (\"Proverbs\"); in the Latin Vulgate the title was \"Proverbia\", from which the English name is derived."}
{"sequence": "Proverbs is not merely an anthology but a \"collection of collections\" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium."}
{"sequence": "It is an example of the biblical wisdom literature, and raises questions of values, moral behaviour, the meaning of human life, and right conduct, and its theological foundation is that \"the fear of God (meaning submission to the will of God) is the beginning of wisdom.\""}
{"sequence": "Wisdom is praised for her role in creation; God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos; and since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life."}
{"sequence": "The superscriptions divide the collections as follows: \"Proverbs\" translates to the Hebrew word \"mashal\", but \"mashal\" has a wider range of meaning than the short catchy sayings implied by the English word."}
{"sequence": "Thus, while roughly half the book is made up of \"sayings\" of this type, the other half is made up of longer poetic units of various types."}
{"sequence": "These include \"instructions\" formulated as advice from a teacher or parent addressed to a student or child, dramatic personifications of both Wisdom and Folly, and the \"words of the wise\" sayings, longer than the Solomonic \"sayings\" but shorter and more diverse than the \"instructions\"."}
{"sequence": "The first section (chapters 1–9) consists of an initial invitation to young men to take up the course of wisdom, ten \"instructions\", and five poems on personified Woman Wisdom."}
{"sequence": "Proverbs 10:1–22:16, with 375 sayings, consists of two parts, the first (10–4) contrasting the wise man and the fool (or the righteous and the wicked), the second (15–22:16) addressing wise and foolish speech."}
{"sequence": "22:17 opens 'the words of the wise', until 24, with short moral discourses on various subjects."}
{"sequence": "Chapters 25–29, attributed to editorial activity of \"the men of Hezekiah,\" contrasts the just and the wicked and broaches the topic of rich and poor."}
{"sequence": "Chapter 30:1–4, the \"sayings of Agur\", introduces creation, divine power, and human ignorance."}
{"sequence": "It is impossible to offer precise dates for the sayings in Proverbs, a \"collection of collections\" relating to a pattern of life which lasted for more than a millennium."}
{"sequence": "The phrase conventionally used for the title is taken from chapter 1:1, \"mishley shelomoh\", Proverbs of Solomon (the phrase is repeated at 10:1 and 25:1), is likely more concerned with labeling the material than ascribing authorship."}
{"sequence": "The book is an anthology made up of six discrete units."}
{"sequence": "The first, chapters 1–9, was probably the last to be composed, in the Persian or Hellenistic periods."}
{"sequence": "This section has parallels to prior cuneiform writings."}
{"sequence": "The second, chapters 10–22:16, carries the superscription \"the proverbs of Solomon\", which may have encouraged its inclusion in the Hebrew canon."}
{"sequence": "The third unit is headed \"bend your ear and hear the words of the wise\": a large part of it is a recasting of a second-millennium BCE Egyptian work, the Instruction of Amenemope, and may have reached the Hebrew author(s) through an Aramaic translation."}
{"sequence": "The third, 22:17–24:22, contains 'the words of the wise'."}
{"sequence": "Chapter 24:23 begins a new section and source with the declaration, \"these too are from the wise.\""}
{"sequence": "The next section at chapter 25:1 has a superscription to the effect that the following proverbs were transcribed \"by the men of Hezekiah\", indicating at face value that they were collected in the reign of Hezekiah in the late 8th century BCE."}
{"sequence": "Chapters 30 and 31 (the \"words of Agur,\" the \"words of Lemuel,\" and the description of the ideal woman) are a set of appendices, quite different in style and emphasis from the previous chapters."}
{"sequence": "The \"wisdom\" genre was widespread throughout the ancient Near East, and reading Proverbs alongside the examples recovered from Egypt and Mesopotamia reveals the common ground shared by international wisdom."}
{"sequence": "The wisdom literature of Israel may have been developed in the family, the royal court, and houses of learning and instruction; nevertheless, the overwhelming impression is of instruction within the family in small villages."}
{"sequence": "Along with the other examples of the biblical wisdom tradition – Job and Ecclesiastes and some other writings – Proverbs raises questions of values, moral behavior, the meaning of human life, and righteous conduct."}
{"sequence": "The three retain an ongoing relevance for both religious and secular readers, Job and Ecclesiastes through the boldness of their dissent from received tradition, Proverbs in its worldliness and satiric shrewdness."}
{"sequence": "Wisdom is as close as biblical literature comes to Greek philosophy, of which it was a contemporary; it shares with the Greeks an inquiry into values and reflections on the human condition, although there is no discussion of ontology, epistemology, metaphysics, and the other abstract issues raised by the Greeks."}
{"sequence": "Proverbs was almost excluded from the Bible because of its contradictions (the result of the book's origins as not just an anthology but an anthology of anthologies)."}
{"sequence": "The reader is told, for example, both to \"not answer a fool according to his folly\", according to 26:4, and to \"answer a fool according to his folly\", as 26:5 advises."}
{"sequence": "More pervasively, the recurring theme of the initial unit (chapters 1–9) is that the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, but the following units are much less theological, presenting wisdom as a transmissible human craft, until with 30:1–14, the \"words of Agur,\" we return once more to the idea that God alone possesses wisdom."}
{"sequence": "\"The fear of God is the beginning of wisdom\" (Proverbs 9:10 – the phrase implies submission to God's will)."}
{"sequence": "Wisdom is praised for her role in creation (\"God by wisdom founded the earth; by understanding he established the heavens\" – Proverbs 3:19)."}
{"sequence": "God acquired her before all else, and through her he gave order to chaos (\"When [God] established the heavens… when he drew a circle on then face of the Deeps… when he marked out the foundations of the earth, then I was beside him\" – Proverbs 8:27–31)."}
{"sequence": "Since humans have life and prosperity by conforming to the order of creation, seeking wisdom is the essence and goal of the religious life."}
{"sequence": "Wisdom, or the wise person, is compared and contrasted with foolishness or the fool, meaning one who is lacking in wisdom and uninterested in instruction, not one who is merely silly or playful (though see the words of Agur for a \"fool\" who has wisdom, and could be seen as playful)."}
{"sequence": "For the most part Proverbs offers a simplistic view of life with few grey areas: life lived according to the rules brings reward, life in violation of them is certain to bring disaster."}
{"sequence": "In contrast, Job and Ecclesiastes appear to be direct contradictions of the simplicities of Proverbs, each in its own way all but dismissing the assumptions of the \"wise\"."}
{"sequence": "Noteworthy also is the fact that the \"mighty acts of God\" (the Exodus, the giving of the Torah at Sinai, the Covenant between God and Israel, etc.)"}
{"sequence": "which make up Israel's history are completely or almost completely absent from Proverbs and the other Wisdom books: in contrast to the other books of the Hebrew bible, which appeal to divine revelation for their authority (\"Thus says the Lord!\"),"}
{"sequence": "wisdom appeals to human reason and observation."}
{"sequence": "The books of wisdom compliment each other."}
{"sequence": "Job is the proverbially wisest man on earth yet goes through suffering."}
{"sequence": "This leads some to say proverbs are true in the sense of a maxim that is usually true but not always (such as RC Sproul and also the ESV Study Bible \"Your barns will be filled with plenty is a generalization concerning the effect of honoring the Lord with all that one has and is."}
{"sequence": "It is not, however, more than a generalization (as Job's comforters held), for to view this as a mechanical formula dishonors God and his inscrutable sovereign purposes.\"."}
{"sequence": "The pre-Exilic (i.e. pre-586 BCE) Old Testament allowed no equals to YHWH in heaven, despite the continued existence of an assembly of subordinate servant-deities."}
{"sequence": "The post-Exilic writers of the Wisdom tradition developed the idea that Wisdom existed before creation and was used by God to create the universe: \"Present from the beginning, Wisdom assumes the role of master builder while God establishes the heavens, restricts the chaotic waters, and shapes the mountains and fields.\""}
{"sequence": "Borrowing ideas from Greek philosophers who held that reason bound the universe together, the Wisdom tradition taught that God's Wisdom, Word and Spirit were the ground of cosmic unity."}
{"sequence": "Christianity in turn adopted these ideas and applied them to Jesus: the Epistle to the Colossians calls Jesus \"...image of the invisible God, first-born of all creation...\", while the Gospel of John identifies him with the creative word (\"In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God\")."}
{"sequence": "In the 4th century, when Christianity was caught up in heresies and still developing the creeds which would define its beliefs, was used both to support and refute the claims of the Arians."}
{"sequence": "Online translations of \"Book of Proverbs\":"}
{"sequence": "In the Hebrew Bible it appears in the Ketuvim (\"Writings\"), beside the Song of Songs, Book of Ruth, Ecclesiastes and the Book of Esther (the Megillot or \"Five Scrolls\"), although there is no set order; in the Christian Old Testament it follows the Book of Jeremiah, as the prophet Jeremiah is its traditional author."}
{"sequence": "Jeremiah's authorship is still generally accepted even though authorship isn't specifically notated in the text."}
{"sequence": "According to insight.org \"Both Jewish and Christian tradition ascribe authorship to Jeremiah, and the Septuagint—the Greek translation of the Old Testament—even adds a note asserting Jeremiah as the writer of the book."}
{"sequence": "In addition, when the early Christian church father Jerome translated the Bible into Latin, he added a note claiming Jeremiah as the author of Lamentations\" It is generally accepted that the destruction of Jerusalem by Babylon in 586 BCE forms the background to the poems."}
{"sequence": "The book is partly a traditional \"city lament\" mourning the desertion of the city by God, its destruction, and the ultimate return of the divinity, and partly a funeral dirge in which the bereaved bewails and addresses the dead."}
{"sequence": "The tone is bleak: God does not speak, the degree of suffering is presented as overwhelming, and expectations of future redemption are minimal."}
{"sequence": "Nonetheless, the author repeatedly makes clear that the city (and even the author himself) had profusely sinned against God, to which God had strongly responded."}
{"sequence": "In doing so the author does not blame God but rather presents him as righteous, just and sometimes even as merciful."}
{"sequence": "The book consists of five separate poems."}
{"sequence": "In the first (chapter 1), the city sits as a desolate weeping widow overcome with miseries."}
{"sequence": "In Chapter 2 these miseries are described in connection with national sins and acts of God."}
{"sequence": "Chapter 3 speaks of hope for the people of God: the chastisement would only be for their good; a better day would dawn for them."}
{"sequence": "Chapter 4 laments the ruin and desolation of the city and temple, but traces it to the people's sins."}
{"sequence": "Chapter 5 is a prayer that Zion's reproach may be taken away in the repentance and recovery of the people."}
{"sequence": "Lamentations combines elements of the \"qinah\", a funeral dirge for the loss of the city, and the \"communal lament\" pleading for the restoration of its people."}
{"sequence": "It reflects the view, traceable to Sumerian literature of a thousand years earlier, that the destruction of the holy city was a punishment by God for the communal sin of its people."}
{"sequence": "Beginning with the reality of disaster, Lamentations concludes with the bitter possibility that God may have finally rejected Israel (chapter 5:22)."}
{"sequence": "Sufferers in the face of grief are not urged to a confidence in the goodness of God; in fact God is accountable for the disaster."}
{"sequence": "The poet acknowledges that this suffering is a just punishment, still God is held to have had choice over whether to act in this way and at this time."}
{"sequence": "Hope arises from a recollection of God's past goodness, but although this justifies a cry to God to act in deliverance, there is no guarantee that he will."}
{"sequence": "Repentance will not persuade God to be gracious, since he is free to give or withhold grace as he chooses."}
{"sequence": "In the end, the possibility is that God has finally rejected his people and may not again deliver them."}
{"sequence": "Nevertheless, it also affirms confidence that the mercies of Yahweh (the God of Israel) never end, but are new every morning (3:22–33)."}
{"sequence": "Lamentations consists of five distinct poems, corresponding to its five chapters."}
{"sequence": "Two of its defining characteristic features are the alphabetic acrostic and its qinah meter."}
{"sequence": "But few English translations capture either of these; even fewer attempt to capture both."}
{"sequence": "The first four are written as acrostics."}
{"sequence": "Chapters 1, 2, and 4 each have 22 verses, corresponding to the 22 letters of the Hebrew alphabet, the first lines beginning with the first letter of the alphabet, the second with the second letter, and so on."}
{"sequence": "Chapter 3 has 66 verses, so that each letter begins three lines."}
{"sequence": "Unlike standard alphabetical order, in the middle chapters of Lamentations, the letter Pe (the 17th letter) comes before Ayin (the 16th)."}
{"sequence": "The first chapter uses standard alphabetical order."}
{"sequence": "The fifth poem, corresponding to the fifth chapter, is not acrostic but still has 22 lines."}
{"sequence": "Although some claim that purpose or function of the acrostic form is unknown, it is frequently thought that a complete alphabetical order expresses a principle of completeness, from Alef (first letter) to Tav (22nd letter); the English equivalent would be \"from A to Z\"."}
{"sequence": "Very few English translations even attempt to capture this acrostic nature."}
{"sequence": "One which attempts to do so is that by Ronald Knox although its mapping of the 22 Hebrew letters into the Western alphabet's 26 uses 'A' to 'V' (omitting W, X, Y and Z), thus lacking the \"A to Z\" sense of completeness."}
{"sequence": "Its first four chapters have a well defined qinah rhythm of three stresses followed by two, although the fifth chapter lacks this."}
{"sequence": "Dobbs-Allsopp describes this meter as \"the rhythmic dominance of unbalanced and enjambed lines\"."}
{"sequence": "Again, few English translations attempt to capture this."}
{"sequence": "Exceptions include Robert Alter's \"The Hebrew Bible\" and the \"New American Bible Revised Edition\"."}
{"sequence": "Lamentations has traditionally been ascribed to Jeremiah, probably on the grounds of the reference in 2 Chronicles 35:25 to the prophet composing a lament on the death of King Josiah, but there is no reference to Josiah in the book and no reason to connect it to Jeremiah."}
{"sequence": "The language fits an Exilic date (586–520 BCE), and the poems probably originated from Judeans who remained in the land."}
{"sequence": "Scholars are divided over whether they are the work of one or multiple authors."}
{"sequence": "One clue pointing to multiple authors is that the gender and situation of the first-person witness changes – the narration is feminine in the first and second lamentation, and masculine in the third, while the fourth and fifth are eyewitness reports of Jerusalem's destruction; conversely, the similarities of style, vocabulary, and theological outlook, as well as the uniform historical setting, are arguments for one author."}
{"sequence": "Lamentations is recited annually by Jews on the fast day of Tisha B'Av (\"Ninth of Av\"), mourning the destruction of both the First Temple and the Second."}
{"sequence": "In Western Christianity, readings (often chanted) and choral settings of extracts from the book are used in the Lenten religious service known as Tenebrae (Latin for \"darkness\")."}
{"sequence": "In the Church of England, readings are used at Morning and Evening Prayer on the Monday and Tuesday of Holy Week, and at Evening Prayer on Good Friday."}
{"sequence": "In the Coptic Orthodox Church, the book's third chapter is chanted on the twelfth hour of the Good Friday service, that commemorates the burial of Jesus."}
{"sequence": "Book of Ezekiel The Book of Ezekiel is the third of the Latter Prophets in the Tanakh and one of the major prophetic books in the Old Testament, following Isaiah and Jeremiah."}
{"sequence": "According to the book itself, it records six visions of the prophet Ezekiel, exiled in Babylon, during the 22 years from 593 to 571 BC, although it is the product of a long and complex history and does not necessarily preserve the very words of the prophet."}
{"sequence": "The visions, and the book, are structured around three themes: (1) Judgment on Israel (chapters 1–24); (2) Judgment on the nations (chapters 25–32); and (3) Future blessings for Israel (chapters 33–48)."}
{"sequence": "Its themes include the concepts of the presence of God, purity, Israel as a divine community, and individual responsibility to God."}
{"sequence": "Its later influence has included the development of mystical and apocalyptic traditions in Second Temple and rabbinic Judaism and Christianity."}
{"sequence": "The book moves on to anticipate the destruction of Jerusalem and the Temple, explains this as God's punishment, and closes with the promise of a new beginning and a new Temple."}
{"sequence": "Some of the highlights include: The Book of Ezekiel describes itself as the words of the Ezekiel ben-Buzi, a priest living in exile in the city of Babylon between 593 and 571 BC."}
{"sequence": "Most scholars today accept the basic authenticity of the book, but see in it significant additions by a \"school\" of later followers of the original prophet."}
{"sequence": "According to Jewish tradition, the Men of the Great Assembly wrote the Book of Ezekiel, based on the prophet's words."}
{"sequence": "While the book exhibits considerable unity and probably reflects much of the historic Ezekiel, it is the product of a long and complex history and does not necessarily preserve the very words of the prophet."}
{"sequence": "According to the book that bears his name, Ezekiel ben-Buzi was born into a priestly family of Jerusalem c.623 BC, during the reign of the reforming king Josiah."}
{"sequence": "Prior to this time, Judah had been a vassal of the Assyrian empire, but the rapid decline of Assyria after c. 630 led Josiah to assert his independence and institute a religious reform stressing loyalty to Yahweh, the national God of Israel."}
{"sequence": "Josiah was killed in 609 and Judah became a vassal of the new regional power, the Neo-Babylonian empire."}
{"sequence": "In 597, following a rebellion against Babylon, Ezekiel was among the large group of Judeans taken into captivity by the Babylonians."}
{"sequence": "He appears to have spent the rest of his life in Mesopotamia."}
{"sequence": "A further deportation of Jews from Jerusalem to Babylon occurred in 586 when a second unsuccessful rebellion resulted in the destruction of the city and its Temple and the exile of the remaining elements of the royal court, including the last scribes and priests."}
{"sequence": "The various dates given in the book suggest that Ezekiel was 25 when he went into exile, 30 when he received his prophetic call, and 52 at the time of the last vision c.571."}
{"sequence": "The Jewish scriptures were translated into Greek in the two centuries prior to the Common Era."}
{"sequence": "The Greek version of these books is called the Septuagint."}
{"sequence": "The Jewish Bible in Hebrew is called the Masoretic text (meaning \"passing down\" after a Hebrew word \"Masorah\"; for Jewish scholars and rabbis curated and commented on the text)."}
{"sequence": "The Greek (Septuagint) version of Ezekiel differs considerably from the Hebrew (Masoretic) version – it is shorter and possibly represents an early interpretation of the book we have today (according to the masoretic tradition) – while other ancient manuscript fragments differ from both."}
{"sequence": "The first half of the 20th century saw several attempts to deny the authorship and authenticity of the book, with scholars such as C. C. Torrey (1863–1956) and Morton Smith placing it variously in the 3rd century BC and in the 8th/7th."}
{"sequence": "The pendulum swung back in the post-war period, with an increasing acceptance of the book's essential unity and historical placement in the Exile."}
{"sequence": "The most influential modern scholarly work on Ezekiel, Walther Zimmerli's two-volume commentary, appeared in German in 1969 and in English in 1979 and 1983."}
{"sequence": "Zimmerli traces the process by which Ezekiel's oracles were delivered orally and transformed into a written text by the prophet and his followers through a process of ongoing re-writing and re-interpretation."}
{"sequence": "He isolates the oracles and speeches behind the present text, and traces Ezekiel's interaction with a mass of mythological, legendary and literary material as he developed his insights into Yahweh's purposes during the period of destruction and exile."}
{"sequence": "As a priest, Ezekiel is fundamentally concerned with the \"Kavod YHWH\", a technical phrase meaning the presence (shekhinah) of YHWH (i.e., one of the Names of God) among the people, in the Tabernacle, and in the Temple, and normally translated as \"glory of God\"."}
{"sequence": "In Ezekiel the phrase describes God mounted on his throne-chariot as he departs from the Temple in chapters 1–11 and returns to what Marvin Sweeney describes as a portrayal of \"the establishment of the new temple in Zion as YHWH returns to the temple, which then serves as the center for a new creation with the tribes of Israel arrayed around it\" in chapters 40–48."}
{"sequence": "The vision in chapters 1:4–28 reflects common mythological/Biblical themes and the imagery of the Temple: God appears in a cloud from the north – the north being the usual home of God/the gods in ancient mythology and Biblical literature – with four living creatures corresponding to the two cherubim above the Mercy Seat of the Ark of the Covenant and the two in the Holy of Holies, the innermost chamber of the Temple; the burning coals of fire between the creatures perhaps represents the fire on the sacrificial altar, and the famous \"wheel within a wheel\" may represent the rings by which the Levites carried the Ark, or the wheels of the cart."}
{"sequence": "Ezekiel depicts the destruction of Jerusalem as a purificatory sacrifice upon the altar, made necessary by the \"abominations\" in the Temple (the presence of idols and the worship of the god Tammuz) described in chapter 8."}
{"sequence": "The process of purification begins, God prepares to leave, and a priest lights the sacrificial fire to the city."}
{"sequence": "Nevertheless, the prophet announces that a small remnant will remain true to Yahweh in exile, and will return to the purified city."}
{"sequence": "The image of the valley of dry bones returning to life in chapter 37 signifies the restoration of the purified Israel."}
{"sequence": "Previous prophets had used \"Israel\" to mean the northern kingdom and its tribes; when Ezekiel speaks of Israel he is addressing the deported remnant of Judah; at the same time, however, he can use this term to mean the glorious future destiny of a truly comprehensive \"Israel\"."}
{"sequence": "In sum, the book describes God's promise that the people of Israel will maintain their covenant with God when they are purified and receive a \"new heart\" (another of the book's images) which will enable them to observe God's commandments and live in the land in a proper relationship with Yahweh."}
{"sequence": "The theology of Ezekiel is notable for its contribution to the emerging notion of individual responsibility to God – each man would be held responsible only for his own sins."}
{"sequence": "This is in marked contrast to the Deuteronomistic writers, who held that the sins of the nation would be held against all, without regard for an individual's personal guilt."}
{"sequence": "Nonetheless, Ezekiel shared many ideas in common with the Deuteronomists, notably the notion that God works according to the principle of retributive justice and an ambivalence towards kingship (although the Deuteronomists reserved their scorn for individual kings rather than for the office itself)."}
{"sequence": "As a priest, Ezekiel praises the Zadokites over the Levites (lower level temple functionaries), whom he largely blames for the destruction and exile."}
{"sequence": "He is clearly connected with the Holiness Code and its vision of a future dependent on keeping the Laws of God and maintaining ritual purity."}
{"sequence": "Notably, Ezekiel blames the Babylonian exile not on the people's failure to keep the Law, but on their worship of gods other than Yahweh and their injustice: these, says Ezekiel in chapters 8–11, are the reasons God's Shekhinah left his city and his people."}
{"sequence": "Ezekiel's imagery provided much of the basis for the Second Temple mystical tradition in which the visionary ascended through the Seven Heavens in order to experience the presence of God and understand his actions and intentions."}
{"sequence": "The book's literary influence can be seen in the later apocalyptic writings of Daniel and Zechariah."}
{"sequence": "He is specifically mentioned by Ben Sirah (a writer of the Hellenistic period who listed the \"great sages\" of Israel) and 4 Maccabees (1st century AD)."}
{"sequence": "In the 1st century AD the historian Josephus said that the prophet wrote two books: he may have had in mind the Apocryphon of Ezekiel, a 1st-century BC text that expands on the doctrine of resurrection."}
{"sequence": "Ezekiel appears only briefly in the Dead Sea Scrolls, but his influence there was profound, most notably in the Temple Scroll with its temple plans, and the defence of the Zadokite priesthood in the Damascus Document."}
{"sequence": "There was apparently some question concerning the inclusion of Ezekiel in the canon of scripture, since it is frequently at odds with the Torah (the five \"Books of Moses\" which are foundational to Judaism)."}
{"sequence": "Ezekiel is referenced more in the Book of Revelation than in any other New Testament writing."}
{"sequence": "To take just two well-known passages, the famous Gog and Magog prophecy in Revelation 20:8 refers back to Ezekiel 38–39, and in Revelation 21–22, as in the closing visions of Ezekiel, the prophet is transported to a high mountain where a heavenly messenger measures the symmetrical new Jerusalem, complete with high walls and twelve gates, the dwelling-place of God where his people will enjoy a state of perfect well-being."}
{"sequence": "Apart from Revelation, however, where Ezekiel is a major source, there is very little allusion to the prophet in the New Testament; the reasons for this are unclear, but it cannot be assumed that every Christian or Hellenistic Jewish community in the 1st century would have had a complete set of (Hebrew) scripture scrolls, and in any case Ezekiel was under suspicion of encouraging dangerous mystical speculation, as well as being sometimes obscure, incoherent, and pornographic."}
